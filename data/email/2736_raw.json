I have a new piece, that I believe shows clear \nTekkotsu and also lamination in the mimi.\n\nThe images that follow ( sorry for the poor quality, I will try to get \nbetter ones this weekend ) are attempting to show what I am referring \nto. This first image looks like a lamination showing, and a small dent \naround the area in question.\nhttp://www.nihontomessageboard.com/tsuba_collection/Choshu_Kawaji/mimi-1.jpg\n\nThis image is another lamination showing in another section of the mimi.\nhttp://www.nihontomessageboard.com/tsuba_collection/Choshu_Kawaji/mimi-3.jpg\n\nThis section, I am trying to show what looks like running bones, but \nagain, my photography skills fail me. Basically, through the highlite \narea, there is a bone running on the diagonal.\nhttp://www.nihontomessageboard.com/tsuba_collection/Choshu_Kawaji/mimi-2.jpg\n\nSo, is this common for Choshu works, or is it is un common ?????. I \nbelieve the better works were from the earlier periods, though I am sure \nthere are some excellent examples from the last smiths as well.\n\nCheers\n\nRich\n//\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
