Yes, it is a Tokubetsu Kicho ninteisho.\n\n&gt; Interestingly, the seppa-dai is only gilded\n&gt; on the omote surface -\nThis gilded surface is actually a gilded copper plate that comes out.  Underneath it is the same stylised seppa dai as the other side.  It begs the question as to whether there was at one time a similar plate in the other side.\n\nI regret the poor quality of the photographs - I took them hurriedly some years ago.  Currently the tsuba is not to hand, being on exhibition with other swords and tosogu.  When it comes back to me I&#39;ll take new photos.\n\nRegards,\n\nBarry Thomas.\n\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: Dr John P Lissenden \n  To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Friday, December 08, 2006 3:47 AM\n  Subject: [nihontostudy] Re: Tsuba help\n\n\n  Dear Barry\n\n  I am sorry, but I don&#39;t recall seeing the images of your Namban tsuba \n  before and I am unable to find them in my &#39;in box&#39;. Is a green paper \n  from the NBTHK 35 years ago the equivalent of a tokubetsu kicho paper \n  (or perhaps it has just turned green with age!)\n\n  Namban tsuba are incredibly difficult to photograph, and this \n  difficulty is compounded when the metal is dark. A tsuba of this \n  group with a plano-convex profile is very unusual - I have certainly \n  never seen one. It has the ubiquitous, symmetrical design of \n  affrontes dragons facing the tama jewel (or is it a lotus blossom?, \n  with lashings of gold overlay. The alternating, perforated design \n  inside the mimi is a commonly found one, as is the chryanthemoid \n  mimi. Interestingly, the seppa-dai is only gilded on the omote \n  surface - I sometimes wonder how well would the seppa sit on a seppa-\n  dai such as this. The kodzuka-hitsu is clearly a later addition.\n\n  The photographs are much too dark to enable any deatailed assessment \n  of the carving and undercutting, but it appears to be of quite good \n  quality.\n\n  Date? Who am I to argue with 1670, but that seems to be a pretty \n  exact attribution. Perhaps I would put it rather later - what does \n  the kanteisho say?\n\n  Regards, John.\n\n  --- In nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Barry Thomas&quot; &lt;warlord@...&gt; \n  wrote:\n  &gt;\n  &gt; Dear All,\n  &gt; \n  &gt; Whilst we are on the topic of Namban tsuba I have posted two (not \n  so good) images of my Namban tsuba that took a green paper at the \n  first NBTHK Shinsa in the USA mmm maybe 35 years ago. The obverse \n  (red background) is convex whilst the reverse (green background) is \n  flat. A polisher visiting once commented &quot;a good one!!&quot;.
