My maxim is not to buy anything I cannot hold in\nmy hand and judge for myself.  There are far too many subtleties to do otherwise\non my very limited budget.  If I were a rich man it would be a slightly\ndifferent story, but that&#39;s the way of the world.  Fittings are a little better\njudged from GOOD photos, but from a description such as yours one can only\ncomment in the most general of terms in essay format, which in practice amount\nto nothing that would really help you.  The best way to learn is to buy and make\nmistakes - you WILL make mistakes, I can guarantee that.  So, yes, please give a\nlink to what you seek an opinion on.\n\nBarry Thomas.\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &quot;Kim Ghobrial&quot; &lt;imports@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Saturday, July 09, 2005 11:11 AM\nSubject: Re: [nihontostudy] RE: Question....\n\n\nHey all,\nI&#39;m not sure what is going on, but every time I send something or reply\nto someone, I don&#39;t get any response from anyone.  I kind of feel like I\nand my posts are invisible to everyone.  The other lists that I&#39;m on, I\nget some type of response from someone, and I don&#39;t feel like I&#39;m\nignored.  If someone doesn&#39;t know, I would like to know this, if I need\nto get Photos let me know, but don&#39;t ignore the questions.  There are a\nlot of folks on this list which has expertise in parts of swords or full\nswords and then there are folks, like myself which are learning from\nasking questions and listening to the answers.  I don&#39;t have tons of\nmoney for expensive books, what books I do have, do not cover areas\nwhich I&#39;m asking questions about.  So, please, if someone asks a\nquestion, please acknowledge it, even if it is an answer like, &quot;I don&#39;t\nknow the answer.&quot;\n\nIn the case of the question below, would it help in getting a photo of\nthe pieces and putting it up on this list for all of you to see?\n\nSincerely,\nKim\n\nKim Ghobrial wrote:\n\n&gt;Hi Everyone,\n&gt;Sorry to ask this, but I was looking at an Auction, which I&#39;m going to\n&gt;see tomorrow and wanted to know if this is something for me to look at\n&gt;or not.  Also, if it is okay, if the estimate of $120.00-180.00 is okay\n&gt;for this piece.\n&gt;\n&gt;THREE JAPANESE COLLECTIBLES: two sword fittings, Fuchi-kashira\n&gt;attributed to the Goto School having &quot;kiku&quot; and &quot;kiri&quot; motifs with gold\n&gt;accents on black field, late Edo-early Meiji Period; together with\n&gt;*ivory* carved ojime, inlaid, &quot;Fukuzuke&quot; (good luck) design, signed by\n&gt;the carver, attributed to the Meiji Period.\n&gt;\n&gt;Kim\n\n\n"
