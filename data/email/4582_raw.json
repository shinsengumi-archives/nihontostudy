It supported my own thoughts about Namban\nand also taught me a few things. Some sections are\nmuch more worthwhile than others and it is light on\nillustrations, but I&#39;m glad I bought it and would\nrecommend it to anyone who has ever thought about\nowning a Namban tsuba. I loaned the book to a friend\nand they subsequently bought the book and a rather\nunique &quot;Chinese Zodiac&quot; Namban tsuba from Japan.\n\nCurran\n\n\n\n\n--- Deron Douglas &lt;deron@...&gt;\nwrote:\n\n&gt; Available in:\n&gt; Soft Cover - B&W $50.00\n&gt; Soft Cover - Color $75.00\n&gt; Hardback - Color - $100.00\n&gt; \n&gt; For informational purposes I would suggest the B&W\n&gt; version if you are low on funds and don&#39;t want to\n&gt; spend $100.00 There are not a lot of color pictures\n&gt; BUT the information in this book is really extensive\n&gt; and well done. Of course if you are like me, you may\n&gt; prefer the hardback for it&#39;s durability.\n&gt; \n&gt; -------------\n&gt; The Namban Group of Japanese Sword Guards: A\n&gt; Reappraisal\n&gt; By Dr John Lissenden\n&gt; \n&gt; Prior to their redefinition by Ogawa in 1987, the\n&gt; Namban group of tsuba had received scant attention\n&gt; from scholars. In part, this had been due to the\n&gt; lack of a clearly defined categorisation, making\n&gt; systematic attribution of the group difficult and\n&gt; thus preventing coherent study of the corpus as a\n&gt; whole. Dr John Lissenden uses this redefinition as\n&gt; the starting point in his accessible, creative and\n&gt; thoroughly researched study of Namban tsuba, for\n&gt; which he was awarded the degree of Master of Arts in\n&gt; East Asian Studies by the University of Durham in\n&gt; 2002.\n&gt; \n&gt; The author has made good use of the research that\n&gt; has been previously done by European and Japanese\n&gt; students, but has also been originally critical of\n&gt; some of the established scholarship. This approach\n&gt; has allowed him to present interpretations of Namban\n&gt; tsuba that are indeed new.\n&gt; Among collectors and curators, some aspects of this\n&gt; study will be debated �Eeven contested �Ebut the\n&gt; clarity of the author�s position will cause them to\n&gt; reconsider some of their originally held beliefs.\n&gt; \n&gt; Collectors also will value this study because it\n&gt; presents an innovative categorisation of this\n&gt; previously neglected group of sword guards, and\n&gt; serves to clarify the diversity and relationships of\n&gt; the Namban style. Including, as it does, expositions\n&gt; on both gilding and casting as related to this group\n&gt; of tsuba, the author�s reappraisal also uses the\n&gt; data on sword furniture as a new source of insight\n&gt; and information on historical developments in East\n&gt; Asia during the 16th to 18th centuries.\n&gt; \n&gt; B&W -\n&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1554043654/002-3046604-2029634\n&gt; \n&gt; Paperback - Color -\n&gt; http://www.lulu.com/content/360453\n&gt; \n&gt; Hardback - Color -\n&gt; http://www.lulu.com/content/361355\n&gt; _________________\n&gt; http://www.derondouglas.com\n&gt; http://www.double-dragon-ebooks.com\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been\n&gt; removed]\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?
