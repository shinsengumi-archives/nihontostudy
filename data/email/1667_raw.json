I felt I got quite a bit for the \n  money.  Though the blade is of mill steel, it shows fine wisps of \n  hada (sunagashi).  I have read articles by guys in the know who \n  tested some blades, unfortunately don&#39;t remember where, so you&#39;ll \n  have to do a web search to dig them out.  I think I remember the Chen \n  and the United Cutlery swords got good marks in the cheapie \n  category.  For sure, stay away from the cheap stainless steel blades; \n  they can be brittle and fracture on impact, launching the free end to \n  who-knows-where.  The drawbacks that I can relate re the Chen \n  Practical Katana include the following.  1. The tsuka is non-\n  removable (in fact, the nakago has a kink in it to help insure it \n  stays inside the tsuka); the tsuka must be destroyed to get it off \n  the blade, and any replacement tsuka may not be removed by just \n  sliding it off, due to the nakago kink.  2. The shape of the blade is \n  actually fairly good in that it is reasonably appropriate, regular \n  and lacking in waves/ripples; however, it is &quot;flat polished&quot;, i.e., \n  little or no niku (clamshell curve from the shinogi to the ha).  \n  Thus, it should cut rather well, but be more susceptible to chipping \n  than it would if more traditionally shaped.  Even with these \n  reservations, I feel the Chen katana is a good deal for the money, \n  particularly if you can get a good discount on Ebay.  FWIW.\n\n  NC\n\n\n        Yahoo!
