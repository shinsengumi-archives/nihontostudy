I could never forget the article b=\r\necause he submitted in in longhand and being unfamiliar with many of the te=\r\nrms he used, it was a bear to type up (before computers) for that issue. Dr=\r\nove me nuts, but I was thrilled to have the material. Again, I&#39;ll try to fi=\r\nnd out when this was done and will pass that info on.\n\nRon\nSTL\n\n\n\n  ----- O=\r\nriginal Message ----- \n  From: Andres Pedraza \n  To: nihonto@...=\r\nm ; nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Thursday, December 07, 2006 6:43 =\r\nPM\n  Subject: [nihontostudy] Yari and Naginata\n\n\n  Nihonto People,\n\n  I hav=\r\nen&#39;t seen a whole lot of books on Yari and/or Naginata in \n  English, so ev=\r\nen though it was a bit pricy, I purchased Roald and \n  Susan Knutsen&#39;s book=\r\n (http://tinyurl.com/yxlhuj). I just finished it. \n  I am very impressed an=\r\nd sorry I did not purchase it earlier. The \n  concise yet informative text =\r\nplus the wealth of drawings and plates \n  was well worth the price.\n\n  If t=\r\nhere&#39;s anyone else out there interested in the subject and that \n  has been=\r\n on the fence about this great book because of the price tag, \n  well, stop=\r\n considering it and buy it. Give it to yourself for \n  Christmas. You won&#39;t=\r\n regret it.\n\n  And if Roald and Susan subscribe to these lists (or someone =\r\nwho knows \n  them does) please receive a big thank you from me... This book=\r\n will \n  be a permanent part of my reference library.\n\n  Anyone have any ot=\r\nher books on Yari and/or Naginata they want to \n  recommend? I&#39;m thirsty fo=\r\nr more knowledge now.\n\n  Thanks!\n\n  Andres \n\n  [Non-text portions of this m=\r\nessage have been removed]\n\n\n\n   \n\n[Non-text portions of this message have b=\r\neen removed]\n\n\n"
