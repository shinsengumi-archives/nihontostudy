If it is uneven, and looks like Nagoya mono then chances are that is what it is.\n\nGood Ko-Kinko shakudo has a beautiful rich dark black purplish color not often found in later kinko works, good weight, and normally a floral or vines style of decoration, simple but elegant and very fine nanako, at least the ones I have.\n\nJust my .02 cents worth of course.\n\nJohn\n\n\n\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: bungotakadasword \n  To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Saturday, April 15, 2006 10:19 AM\n  Subject: [nihontostudy] Re: in defense of the ugly bird or seeking more &quot; punishment &quot;\n\n\n  ok, Tom,\n  let&#39;s &quot; spin &quot; it from a different angle.......... how about the Ko-\n  kinko works in soft metal....... the nanako are uneven ( compare to \n  Goto works ), the degree of realism ( I am thinking along the line of \n  that deer tsuba in the swedish collection ) is &quot; child-like &quot; and stiff \n  ( doesn&#39;t even come close to Ishiguro&#39;s work ).............. in short \n  it&#39;s like Nagoya works except they look &quot; aged &quot;.\n\n  They are treasured  because of the age( or the wabi factor ) ? \n\n  Seeking enlightenment ( aka punishment )\n\n\n  Milt\n\n\n\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  YAHOO!
