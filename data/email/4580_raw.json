I will keep studying this \npiece and doing research.\n\nOne last question, though - If this was a &quot;replica&quot;, would there be a \nhamon, or would it just be uniformly treated? I have some experience \nwith polishing, and would like to learn the Japanese methods to \nsupplement my Western knifemaking skills. Would it be worth the time to \ntry to polish the blade, and does anyone know where I might be able to \npurchase Japanese polishing supplies?\n\nThanks!\nBen\n\n"
