I don&#39;t know much about lacquer (where&#39;s John Badenhop?), but I&#39;d guess that it helps the adhesion of the lacquer and/or strengthens the whole structure.\n\nI think that this is the only two layer kawa guard I&#39;ve seen, too.  I&#39;ve seen up to six layers used.  The Edo period ones tend to use fewer layers than the old ones, but I have seen 3 layers used in Kamakura period kawa tsuba.\n\nI put up a detail lifted from the kawatsutsumi tachi koshirae on page 25 of Kajihara-san&#39;s Visual Glossary:\nhttp://tinyurl.com/d2q4\n\nThose of you with the book will probably have better luck looking at that.  The kawa tsuba has delaminated like those at Oyamazumi, but the upper half is still wrapped in what looks like a cloth bag.  I&#39;m not sure if there are any traces of lacquer remaining.  There are o-seppa.  I have no idea if the lacquer has come off, or if some of these plain kawa tachi tsuba were never lacquered.\n\nJim\n\n\n\n\nJim,\n\nCool! I assume the fabric was that stuff they sometimes use when they \nlacquer things? (I had a naginata pole with what appeared\nto be fabric under the lacquer once...)\n\nrkg\n(Richard George)\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
