Just buy from reputable dealers.\n   \n  Perhaps the easiest way to learn about fittings is to buy as many books as you can and educate yourself - go to shows as well.\n   \n  Good luck with your collecting!\n   \n  Regards\n\nanwahi &lt;anwahi@...&gt; wrote:\n  Hello,\n\nI&#39;m new here and to collecting Tsuba. Where do you buy your Tsuba from? \nI know there&#39;s several websites you can find with a Google search, an \noccasional Token Kai show like the one in SF, or Ebay (most look like \njunk). I&#39;m looking for good sources of authentic Tsuba. Obviously the \nonly way to be really sure of authenticity is to purchase papered \nTsuba, but because I&#39;m starting off I want some sources of authentic \nTsuba more reasonably priced. Any suggestions?\n\nThanks for your helpo in advance,\nAnthony\n\n\n\n\n    \n---------------------------------\n  YAHOO!
