In a blade like this\nFujishima where open, flowing grain in the shinogi-ji is to be expected,\ndoing an umegane is just silly. The same is true with a very fine omi-yari I\nown that is hugh. It also has a series of rectangular umegane that have\nmostly fallen out. The blade is Kanabo and one should expect powerful\nrunning masame that opens up in places in such a work. There is no reason to\ndo umegane and now that they are visible and have fallen out, it detracts a\ngreat deal from the blade. On the other had, I have a rather nice katana\nwhere the umegane had fallen out. I had it replaced. You can&#39;t see it and it\nlooks better now as opposed to the open hole in the skin. So, a case by case\nanswer. Just my 25 cents worth.\n\nGordon\n  -----Original Message-----\n  From: Peter A Bleed [mailto:pbleed1@...]\n  Sent: Friday, July 04, 2003 12:09 AM\n  To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com\n  Subject: [nihontostudy] umegane-good or bad?\n\n\n\n  Listeros!\n        Allow me to once again present the limits of knowledge with a\n  question that others may find either 1) of interest or  2) answerable.\n        Yesterday I looked at a &quot;sword&quot; brought home from the Philippines\nand\n  owned (proudly) by the nephew of the man who sent it home in 1944. Since\n  this could be anything and not likely for sale, I think we will all agree\n  that the chances of this being of any interest were pretty slim.\nSurprise,\n  it turned out to b a relatively clean wakizashi in a nice old shira-saya.\n  The blade was signed Fujishima Tomoshige, I assume one of the late\n  koto/very early Shinto Kaga smiths of that line - tight itame with a\n  komidare. A sword.\n        Perhaps the most interesting thing about the sword was a rectangular\n  umegane set into the shinogi-ji in the monouchi. It measured maybe 1/4&quot; by\n  1/2&quot; and was clearly visible. It had not fully removed the flaw since\nthere\n  was a clear fukure on its edge.\n        My question to the List is whether on not this kind of umegane is\n  good or bad. Well, it can hardly be &quot;good,&quot; right? There was a flaw there,\n  but an umegane must be better than a flaw, right? Does an umegane detract\n  from or enhance the value of a sword?  And how visible should an umegane\n  be?  Is the fact that this plug was clearly visible - and square! - mean\n  that it was poorly done?\n        Peter Bleed\n\n\n\n\n        Yahoo!
