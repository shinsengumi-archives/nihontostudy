I am new to yahoo groups and this is my=\r\n first post so I do not yet know the proper protocall. My name is Mark Pede=\r\nrson and I just purchased a 17th. century wakizashi with NTHK papers rating=\r\n this shoto as kanteisho, the smith being Kaneyoshi of the Mino school @ Gi=\r\nfo. Thats all I know right now but would like to know more. My scanner is n=\r\not working but I do have pictures. I will try to figure out how to post the=\r\nm.
