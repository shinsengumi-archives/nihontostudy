Yes I think this is a Repo also, but maybe late 20th\n&gt;   century as a guess. It&#39;s a copy, I believe of a K� Sh�ami tsuba that was\n&gt;   originally done in a soft metal (Yamagane from memory) in the Momoyama\n&gt;   period, or perhaps a bit earlier.\n&gt;\n&gt;   Anyway. as I said, I think this is a very modern repo, just my opinioon\n&gt;   nayway.\n&gt;\n&gt;   Cheers\n&gt;\n&gt;   Richard\n&gt;\n&gt;   darpa_ems wrote:\n&gt;   &gt;\n&gt;   &gt; I&#39;ve had this tsuba for well over 20 years, & have wondered what info\n&gt;   &gt; there might be on it... It&#39;s a rabbit & waves design, with no ID \n&gt;marks.\n&gt;   &gt; It&#39;s iron, about 8cm x 8.5cm x 4mm. I believe it&#39;s a early 20th\n&gt;   &gt; cent. repro, at least I kind of hope it is, as it&#39;s been on several of\n&gt;   &gt; my practice swords over the years... When I got it it had a nice solid\n&gt;   &gt; brown patina, but enough rust scaling to need cleaning with a \n&gt;wirewheel.\n&gt;   &gt;\n&gt;   &gt; Pics are here-\n&gt;   &gt; http://ph.groups.yahoo.com/group/nihontostudy/photos/browse/e85a\n&gt;   &gt; &lt;http://ph.groups.yahoo.com/group/nihontostudy/photos/browse/e85a&gt;\n&gt;   &gt;\n&gt;   &gt; Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated. Not looking to sell it,\n&gt;   &gt; just info on period, school, maker, etc... :)\n&gt;   &gt;\n&gt;   &gt; Thanks!\n&gt;   &gt;\n&gt;   &gt; A.W.\n&gt;   &gt;\n&gt;   &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"
