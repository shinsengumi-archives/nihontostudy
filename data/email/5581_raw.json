The famous set of Asuka period bronze st=\r\natues of\nYakushi nyorai and Gakko and Nikko at Yakushi-ji in Nara have an e=\r\narly\nexample of the grape motif on the base of the Yakushi nyorai statue, s=\r\no we\nare talking middle 500s or so. Squirrels may be included in the motif,=\r\n but I\ncan=92t recall right off hand. Thus, there is a definite Buddhist co=\r\nnnection.\nThe motif shows up in sword fittings rather early and I believe t=\r\nhere are\npieces by Joshin or at least around that time with the motif. Ko-K=\r\ninko\nworkers produced it, and there are also some Ko-Mino examples, if memo=\r\nry\nserves. As you move into the Edo period, it seems to me that the motif w=\r\nas\nnot as popular. Certainly from the mid to late Edo period you do not see=\r\n it\nvery much. If I can remember, I will see what some of my other sources =\r\nhave\nto say. I did see your earlier message about this, but just didn=92t j=\r\nump at\nit.\n\n \n\nSorry we will miss you in SF, but we can catch up at the Dai=\r\ntoken-ishi.\n\n \n\nGordon\n\n \n\n  _____  \n\nFrom: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com [m=\r\nailto:nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com] On\nBehalf Of Ron Hartmann\nSent: Thursda=\r\ny, July 09, 2009 10:28 AM\nTo: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: Re: [ni=\r\nhontostudy] Fw: Sword term meaning...\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks for the reply, Gordon=\r\n.

These iny=F4kon posts continued until\nthe late Muromachi period into th=\r\ne Momoyama period.

On an added note, at=\r\n least the first three generations of\nthe main line Goto masters are said t=\r\no have only used iny=F4kon posts and\nmenuki without them will typically be =\r\nattributed to Ko-Goto rather than one\nof the main guys.
