It is interesting that we have well preserved &quot;true&quot; inlay on Kofun period fittings and even swords, as well as pieces with sheet gold overlay but no nunome examples.  It is hard to believe that the technique was unknown or unexploited prior to the Muromachi period.\n\nJim\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Peter,\n  My impression is that nunome zogan first appears on Japanese sword fittings\n  in the late Muromachi period.\n\n  Jim\n\n  Jim and Others,\n        Thanks for the replies. I too have noted that the technique we call\n  nunome turns up in lots of premodern metal working traditions. In addition\n  to those noted, I have seen it on Tibetan and &quot;Chinese&quot; stuff, most notably\n  in our area of interest on Chinese &quot;Namban&quot; tsuba, for example. The\n  explicit item that triggered my question is an iron six-sided vase I have\n  with heavy (but not very attractive) silver overlay that I think is Korean.\n  Does anyone know the Korean word for such stuff, by the way?\n        I have also noted that the earliest apparent occurrences of this\n  technique on Japanese stuff all seem to have a Muromachi sort of age. Given\n  its apparent world-wide distribution of the technique, it must have either\n  been introduced or invented in Japan at that time, OR, older stuff has not\n  survived. I tend to favor the later idea.\n        It is possible, I betcha, that the fine iron striations that hold the\n  gold/silver on, simply won&#39;t survive more than about 500 years. If they\n  largely oxidize away in that kind of time frame, all older examples would\n  be gone so it would look like nunome suddenly appeared.\n        Let me add, in closing, that virtually all of the techniques Japanese\n  kinko use do show up in other parts of the world and other artistic\n  traditions. The Japanese like to see themselves as innovators in this\n  regard, but what they really did, IMHO, is bring basic techniques to high\n  levels of virtuosity. This weekend I bought a couple of swords. One is a\n  rather ordinary nippon-to, but the other a really nice cuphilt (Spanish?)\n  rapier that is embellished with light repousse, good horidashi engraving,\n  and a wonderfully even &quot;nanako-ishime&quot; finish that is as nice as any on an\n  iron tsuba. Craftsmanship is where we find it, mebbe.\n\n  Peter Bleed\n  Associate Dean\n  College of Arts and Sciences\n  1223 Oldfather Hall\n  University of Nebraska\n  Lincoln, NE 68588-0312\n  (402) 472-2891\n\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
