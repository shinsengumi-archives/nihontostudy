Thought I&#39;d ask if anyone knows of any factual articles or simply some background information on those miniature &quot;Boys swords&quot; that we sometimes see from time to time. Some of these appear pretty low-end quality while on occasion, some real workmanship shows up. \n\nPersonally, I&#39;ve never had much interest in these but recently, a very nice quality one was brought to me here in St. Louis by an antique appraiser friend. Now I own it. What impressed me was the nice quality of the fittings, the baleen wrapping and a very handsome, well forged blade. The blade appears to be signed Bizen Osafune Morimitsu and is dated Oei 5 but more likely, from what I&#39;ve gathered, it is more likely a shinshinto creation made as a Morimitsu. Hamon is a narrow suguha with ko-nei with a boshi swept in ko-nie (hakikake). Bo hi and an extended kissaki, male/female mekugi with &quot;mellon&quot; crest. Quite a nice &quot;package&quot; as we say. \n\nI&#39;ve been told some of these were for export, but others were indeed made for presentation during coming-of-age. It would seem that somebody would know more detail about these swords or perhaps know of an authoritative article on them somewhere. \n\nRon\nSTL\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
