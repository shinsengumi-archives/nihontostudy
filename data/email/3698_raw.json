One of these wide-spaced mei guards was submitted to shinsa in Chicago and failed as gimei.  I don&#39;t know if any examples have been accepted as valid.  Personally, I don&#39;t see why anyone would sign like that if attempting to deceive.  The workmanship of these looks early Edo period, so it may be the signature of another &quot;other&quot; Nobuie working then.\n\nThat kind of wide spaced signature is rare for tsuba in general.  I have seen an Umetada signature like that, but that&#39;s about it.\n\nJim\n\n\n\n  Pete,\n\n  I&#39;m fairly certain you aren&#39;t referring to the\n  different Nobuiye (Akasaka Nobuiye, Myochin Nobuiye,\n  Owari Nobuiye, Echizen Nobuiye, etc). Jim or someone\n  else will comment best on this, but I was reading\n  through Haynes Catalogs last night and did come upon\n  across a section comparing 3 examples of &#39;Nobuiye\n  longmei&#39;. Basically looks like his ana spacing left\n  him too narrow a space for his normal signature and he\n  consequently squeezed out his signature with one\n  character at the top and bottom V of area between the\n  two openings.\n     I don&#39;t know how much of a variation this was\n  considered.\n\n  Curran\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
