This does \nnot effect genuine collectors, though they will need to have a permit \nand a Alarm on their house. Importing swords will be a different matter. \nA license would have to be produced then I would assume. Also, I am in \nPerth and visit Victoria as often as I can ( I am from there originally \n) and taking any swords in with me will also be interesting.\n\nMy major concern is the amount of old WW2 swords that widows and the \nlike may have that are handed in to be destroyed. These swords are not \nthe problem, it is the junk you buy from sports and knive stores that \nare the real problem.\n\nThere is more information coming in soon. I will forward what I get as I \nget it, or Barry will.\n\nCheers\n\nRich Turner\n\n\n\nVerne wrote:\n\n&gt; How will this affect antique sword collections and how will they\n&gt; enforce it?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; -- In nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com, Richard Turner &lt;ikkanshi@w...&gt;\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; This just in from Barry Thomas\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Rich,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The Vic Gov has banned swords - announced y&#39;day and in today&#39;s\n&gt; Herald Sun page 11.
