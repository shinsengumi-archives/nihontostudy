The most common theory as to why there is such a high incidence of\nshintetsu showing in Hizen swords is that they were economizing in the\nproduction process, ie, reducing costs by using less of the outer skin\nmaterial which requires more folding and hence is more expensive. I have\nnever found that to be a very good answer as they were, after all,\npatronized by a major Daimyo and Hizen, as a major trading center, both\nas\nan entrepot and as a ceramic producer, and large koku domain, could\nhardly\nhave been poor. I have no basis whatsoever for this but I wonder if the\nanswer might lie in their choice to make blades with a relatively\nlarger,\nin a cross section sense, core steel. That would make the blade more\nflexible. Do any of you who are up on the construction part of swords\nfind\nthis makes sense from a functional point of view? \nIt is interesting to note that in the Chicago display of Rai blades last\nyear, from which Hizen took its model, there was vertually no shintetsu\nto\nbe seen! \nCheers.\n\nArnold Frenzel\nafrenzel@...\n\n\nOn Wed, 30 Apr 2003, Matthew E.
