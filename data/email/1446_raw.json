Now I have thought it over some more I would have\nto agree with you and Jim. Would love to find out if they did indeed use\nan irregular hammer and anvil in the old days, I wonder if anyone else\ncould give us some more thoughts on this? \n \nI can highly recommend Graham Gemmell&#39;s book: Tosogu, treasure of the\nsamurai. It is infact a catalog of an exhibition/sale held in London in\n&#39;91 at a big name Gallery.  Very beautiful book with great illustrations\nand very interesting thoughts on the pieces that were on show. Also it\njust occured to me that none of these pieces are papered, at least there\nis no mention of any papers whatsoever anywhere in the catalog. \n \nTalking about surface finishes, I was wondering about the &#39;cat scratch&#39;\nfinish we often see on the back of kozuka and kogai. What purpose does\nthis serve and when did this practice begin? Is it at all related to\n&#39;cat scratch habaki&#39; that have that texture not only for the beauty of\nit, but also because it secures the sword in the saya a tiny bit more?\nAlso we often see this motif in combination with a polished shakudo or\nother ground, sometimes in the form of two triangles, sometimes simply\ntwo rectangles next to each other. Is there any reason for this, a\nkantei point perhaps?\n \n- Matt \n \n \n\n\n    Z Recruiting Services\n    &quot;Zurich Toren&quot; Muzenstraat 89\n    2511 WB Den Haag\n    T: +31 70 4262273\n    F: +31 70 4262111\n    W: zrecruiting.com\n    E: info@...\n    Kijk ook op monsterboard.nl, jobbingmall.nl en \n    nationalevacaturebank.nl voor actuele vacatures!\n\n\n-----Oorspronkelijk bericht-----\nVan: Peter A Bleed [mailto:pbleed1@...] \nVerzonden: maandag 12 januari 2004 15:57\nAan: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com\nOnderwerp: RE: [nihontostudy] Ko-Katchushi tsuba.....\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMatt,\nYou have engendered an interesting discussion and elicited Jim&#39;s usually\nworthwhile insights. Thanks\nIn response to your comments, I took a look again and some of my\nkatchushi\nguards last night (they used to be so common and cheap that I couldn&#39;t\navoid becoming a &#39;collector&#39;). I have always loved the finish of these\ntsuba which looks old and natural but which is also obviously the\ncreation\nof human intention. I am not familiar with Gemmell&#39;s book, but - like\nJim -\nI am sceptical about the use of a pointed hammer to created tsuba\nsurfaces.\nI can believe that a kinko might make and use a hammer with a network of\nvery fine points. As I think about it, use of irregular hammer and anvil\nsurfaces during the forging of the initial plate might be a means of\nsetting up the internal irregularities we call bones etc.\nI agree with Jim, too, that whatever means was used to created a surface\nfinish, it probably involved a chisel or punch rather than direct\npounding\nwith a hammer.\nIn that regard, let me recall a conversation with Hagawa-san, the Sendai\nkinko I have mentioned to the list before. He makes frequent use of\n&quot;ishime&quot; which is a smooth but &#39;irregular&#39; surface of small dots that\nlooks\nlike a stone (ishi means stone). He told me that ishime is as hard to do\nas\nnanako. It is done with specially crested punches (&#39;tagane&#39;) that are\nstruck with a hammer - one dot at a time. Hagawa-san said that once\nstarted, an entire surface had to be done in one setting to assure a\nuniform texture. If the work was interrupted, the piece will be ruined.\nThus, before he starts an ishime surface, he tells his wife and family\nthat\nthey should not interrupt him til the tapping stopped. Maybe the point\nhere\nis that even if special tools are used, it is still the craftsman&#39;s\nskill\nand intensity that matters.\n\nPeter Bleed\n\n\n\nYahoo!
