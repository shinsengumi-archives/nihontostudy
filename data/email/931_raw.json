As long as the 1/3 of one side is \nnot too severely damaged and everything else about the guard is good, \nI think it would pass, however the point level would be significantly \nlower than for the same guard in overall good condition.  If the rust \nis bad and/or the guard is only ordinary quality, you might be \nlooking at a shinteisho level paper (60-69 points).  If it was a much \nbetter than average tsuba and the rust isn&#39;t too bad, a kanteisho \nmight be possible.  It depends on just what levels of quality and \ncondition you have.\n&gt; \n&gt; Jim\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\njim und all,\ntsuba in question  can be viewed \nat..............http://tinyurl.com/rtsx\n\nlast 5 pics, labelled shinsa\n\nmilt\n\n\n"
