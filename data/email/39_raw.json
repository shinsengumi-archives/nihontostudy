I really can not imagine samurai sitting around discussing the weight of a tsuba and how it affects cutting, unless it is as heavy as a brick.  A tsuba offers some protection for your hand.  The only exception that I know about is that a very long sword is extremely difficult to draw if you have a large tsuba.  The tsuba  makes too much contact with your wrist.  So a small tsuba is best.  Now, what I have seen is a handle that has metal inlayed at the end of the tsuka past the nakago.  I have a shin shinto katana that is 32&quot; long.  It sounds very awkward to use but actually it is made in a interesting way.  The blade is slender and has fumbari and a strong curvature, also the stuba is leather with black lacquer over it and the tsuka has some kind of steel inlayed it at the end.  It is very noticeable.  The fact that the tsuba has almost no weight and the tsuka has extra weight added in the at the end of it makes this blade very nice to cut with.  At 32&quot; long it actually feel light.  I hope to write an article on this sword with pictures in the future when I have more time.\n\nRegards,\nMoses Becerra \n\n\n\n----- Original Message ----- \n  From: Jim Gilbert \n  To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Wednesday, April 23, 2003 8:56 PM\n  Subject: Re: [nihontostudy] tsuba balance\n\n\n  Tom sent in his subscription request, but hasn&#39;t confirmed it, so he\n  probably isn&#39;t getting email yet.  Tom is 5th dan.\n\n  I&#39;d certainly like to hear more about this if it is really that critical.\n\n  Bob Elder, can you comment on how the weight of the tsuba affects the feel\n  and function of a sword?\n\n  Jim\n\n\n  &gt; Tom Helm would be the one to have here to answer this, I believe he is 5th\n  or 6th dan in MJSR Iaido. I studdied for about 3 years before my back and\n  knees go the better of me, I was always taught to be careful fitting new\n  tsuba to my sword as the slightest change in the swords balance can effect\n  the cut. I also think that an unbalaced sword would be hard on the arms\n  after say 100 or more cuts. A Katana is fairly hard work with one hand and I\n  would think the lighter the better.\n  &gt;\n  &gt; Does anyone know if Big Tom is on board or knows about this list ?\n  &gt;\n  &gt; cheers all\n  &gt;\n  &gt; Rich\n  &gt;   ----- Original Message -----\n  &gt;   From: Jim Gilbert\n  &gt;   To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com\n  &gt;   Sent: Thursday, April 24, 2003 3:33 AM\n  &gt;   Subject: Re: [nihontostudy] tsuba balance\n  &gt;\n  &gt;\n  &gt;   Rich,\n  &gt;   It sounds plausible.
