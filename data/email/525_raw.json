I think that as a general rule the notion\nof size and value, other things being equal, except in the restricted\nsituation of a daisho perfectly matched, but now separated pair, is really\nnot an operational comparison. Tsuba size choices of the artisan were\ndetermined by the parameters of the blade and koshirae appropriate to the\nperiod of initial manufacture. What make tsuba interesting and desirable\nis how close the fit is what it ought to be for the time of manufacture.\nIf one follows Sasano sensei, for example, with respect to the earliest\ntosho tsuba, the early ones were small and the later ones as a rule were\nlarger. Even though the designs might be quite similar, the criterion of\noriginality and probable scarcity ought to yield a significantly higher\nprice for the older but smaller piece. Mutatis mutandis the same argument\nholds for tsuba of different types and periods. How close the fit between\nthe piece at hand and the ideal type is probably the main determinant of\nvalue. For a short answer I do not believe that there is a correlation\nmerely between size and market value. My two cents worth anyway.  \n\nArnold Frenzel\nafrenzel@...\n\n\nOn Wed, 9 Jul 2003, Matthew E.

All things\n&gt; being equal, would a 2.8 inch diam tsuba be worth less than say an\n&gt; identical 3.5 inch one ? Or even a 4 inch one ?\n&gt;  \n&gt; also when is a tsuba considered to be of wakizashi or katana size ? and\n&gt; would that affect the price as well ?\n&gt;  \n&gt; thanks for listening !\n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt; - Matt\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; nihontostudy-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
