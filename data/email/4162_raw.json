Ah, this\nis indeed a different kettle of fish.  I think even Milt might say that this\ndeer is kicking with a bit of life!!  I iamgine that in the hand it would look\neven better?  I look forward to reading further discussion on this tsuba and\nKo-Kinko in general.  Here I must mention Robert Burawoy&#39;s little picture book\nof early tsuba.  I don&#39;t have it immediately to hand but Msr Burawoy discusses\nearly tsuba types with the passion that appears to come from serious and\nhard-won knowledge.  I&#39;ll dig it out and read it again in conjunction with the\npresent discussion.  Could I suggest that those of you who have followed this\ndiscussion with interest should seek out Msr Burawoy&#39;s little book if you don&#39;t\nalready have it.\n\nBarry Thomas.\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &quot;David Zincavage&quot; &lt;jdz@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Friday, April 21, 2006 3:28 PM\nSubject: Re: [nihontostudy] Re: in defense of the ugly bird or seeking more &quot;\npunishment &quot;\n\n\nBefore we start discussing it, here is a good picture from the 1977 Christie&#39;s\nLndgren Sal catalogue:\n\nhttp://zincavage.org/KoKinkoKasugane.htm\n\n\n  ----- Original Message -----\n  From: Barry Thomas\n  To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com\n  Sent: Monday, April 17, 2006 12:13 PM\n  Subject: Re: [nihontostudy] Re: in defense of the ugly bird or seeking more &quot;\npunishment &quot;\n\n\n  I have followed this discussion with great interest and will have to go over\nit\n  again I&#39;m sure, but I clearly see what Milt is talking about.
