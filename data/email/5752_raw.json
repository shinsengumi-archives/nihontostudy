Pieces I  \nhave seen are typically poor quality swords, with poor quality  \nfittings very roughly made and usually lacquer that seems to have been  \na few coats shy of a full job.\n\nSome but not all are clearly Satsuma koshirae which is all I think  \nthese things are, just poor quality Satsuma koshirae. Hence my  \nquestion - has anyone seen reference to these in Japanese sources?  \nWhat are they called in Japanese and what is the rationale for  \nassigning these to the rebellion specifically?\n\n-t\nTom Helm\ntoryu@...\n&quot;Moriamur, et in media arma ruamus&quot;\n- Vergil\n\n\n\n\n"
