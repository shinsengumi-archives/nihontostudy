However, \n&gt; please\n&gt; bear in mind that we are processing not only your half dozen \n&gt; kanteisho, but\n&gt; hundreds of kanteisho. They are now complete. We are working on a few\n&gt; problems such as missing photographs and getting Jim Gilbert&#39;s newly made\n&gt; stamp on the kodogu and koshirae papers. They will be sent to New York \n&gt; this\n&gt; month, which is a very fast turn around time for such a large project. \n&gt; They\n&gt; will be sent out individually from there, so I would expect everyone will\n&gt; have theirs sometime in February. I would also like to remind everyone \n&gt; that\n&gt; our kanteisho are all hand done by a group of calligraphy experts. And \n&gt; we do\n&gt; not use photographs for the nakago -- only hand done oshigata. This all\n&gt; takes time because we want to provide a good product for your investment.\n&gt; Please be patient a bit longer.\n&gt;\n&gt; Gordon\n&gt;\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: KHolz64873@...
