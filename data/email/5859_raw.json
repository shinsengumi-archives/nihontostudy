It had gone straight from the forge to the Shrine and was still in \nshiratogi.  Alan&#39;s find is indeed remarkable, and thank you for sharing \nAlan.  If I might comment, like David Zincavage I&#39;ve been unhappy with the \nesnips protocol for looking at photos on their website.  Alan, if you would \ncare to upload them to a yahoo folder or http://photobucket.com/ I would \nlove to see them.  The last time I used it Photobucker required you to \ncreate an account, but that is all.\n\nRegards,\nBarry Thomas.\n\n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;abale.vossnet.co.uk&quot; &lt;abale@...&gt;\nTo: &quot;Nihonto Study&quot; &lt;nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Saturday, July 23, 2011 4:39 AM\nSubject: [nihontostudy] Nagamaki\n\n\nMembers of the list have rightly been sceptical of my find as it is almost \nunheard of in the West, if I had not seen it myself I would not have \nbelieved it either. I have seen many swords with Muromachi/Momoyama style \nkoshirae over the years, but 99.9% have been 19th c. swords in retro style. \nTwo exceptions come to mind: Victor Harris and I catalogued the blades in \nthe Museum of Japanese Sword Fittings in Tokyo for Christie&#39;s in &#39;05. In \nthat collection was a Momoyama tachi koshirae that was later sold in NY, the \nother was an itomaki tachi made for an Ikeda Daimyo in Christie&#39;s London. \nVictor has seen this nagamaki and agrees that it is 16th c.\n\nI think this weapon is the first of a number of identical contract pieces \nfor an armoury, as it is numbered &#39;1&#39; as are one seppa, the fuchi and the \ntsuka in ink under the fuchi, it is utilitarian, with thin yamagane mounts \nand low quality lacquer, the nakago-ana are not well made. The long ububa \ncan be accounted for by its lack of use, it may have been polished only once \nor twice then stored for a very long time, this would account for its fairly \ngood condition apart from the leather tsuka binding shrinking and being \nattacked by insects.\n\nIt may look like a sword but it has the thick saya of a polearm, no kurikata \nand the tsuka is 21.5&quot; long.\n\nAs I stated in my earlier post it weighs around 6lbs, this is not something \none would want as a personal weapon, it is too heavy and awkward to carry \nand I think would only be useful in battle. \n\n\n\n"
