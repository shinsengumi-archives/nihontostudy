Within both the hanare and futoji-mei \n&gt; types there is considerable variation in the detail of the signatures. \n&gt;  This example is not one of the more boldly executed futoji-mei.  As \n&gt; Pete crypictically indicated, an oshigata of this guard is published \n&gt; in Nakamura Kakudayu and Akiyama Kyusaku&#39;s 1926 Nobuie Tsuba shu \n&gt; (#52).  There the signature is described as sumari-mei \u001b$B5M$jLC\u001b(B (&quot;close \n&gt; packed&quot;), which is one of the older terms now included within the \n&gt; futoji-mei type.  This guard is described as futoji-mei in several \n&gt; later books and in the NBTHK&#39;s attribution.\n&gt;\n&gt; The hitsuana had not yet been filled when the oshigata was made.  This \n&gt; guard was the property of the Okubo daimyo family in Odawara until it \n&gt; was sold in 1931, so the ana were likely filled by the new owner.  It \n&gt; is unlikely that they are original to the plate given that they are \n&gt; made such that the guard would be mounted with the unsigned side as \n&gt; the front.  The shapes of the hitsuana are unusual.   It was clearly \n&gt; mounted with an o-kozuka, which are typically 18-20 mm wide (vs. the \n&gt; standard size of 14-15 mm).  As Gordon mentioned, the small size of \n&gt; the kogai-ana suggests it was mounted with one of the narrow style \n&gt; ko-Mino kogai.  The opening is too small to accommodate a standard \n&gt; 14-15 mm wide kogai.\n&gt;\n&gt; The early Edo period &quot;betsujin&quot; (different person) Nobuie work will \n&gt; lack the quality in the metal, tekkotsu, finish and carving.  The \n&gt; plates are usually rather characterless and the working lacks \n&gt; subtlety.  The late Edo period revival pieces do indeed try to emulate \n&gt; the finish of the originals and as Alan mentioned some do a fairly \n&gt; good job.  In general, the working of the rim is a bit forced and \n&gt; overdone in these examples compared to the originals.  They obviously \n&gt; will look young, but there is also a somewhat artificial quality to \n&gt; them.  The same feeling comes from later copies of early Shino and \n&gt; Oribe ceramics.\n&gt;\n&gt; The metal, tekkotsu and yakite finish should lead to an Owari origin.  \n&gt; Remember that Kaneie worked in Kyoto, and everything about his guards \n&gt; is in line with Kyoto methods and aesthetics.\n&gt;\n&gt; That&#39;s all I can think of at the moment.\n&gt;\n&gt; Jim\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   The photos for kantei problem number three can be viewed here:\n&gt;\n&gt;   http://ph.groups.yahoo.com/group/nihontostudy/photos/browse/3108\n&gt;\n&gt;   Jim\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
