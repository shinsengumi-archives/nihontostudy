This is where cleaning out the \n&gt; sukashi openings can hurt you even if you personally like the way \n&gt; that looks.  If the age cues are contradictory, the judgment tends \nto \n&gt; go to the younger date.  The object of conservation or even \n&gt; restoration is not to make the guard look new.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\none more question..........\nwhat if there are active red rust in the opening ? leave it alone to \ncontinue doing structural damage ?  Some of the early sukashi guards \nhave very &quot; thin &quot; opening and I have seen some iron  can literally \nfell off with the slightest touch............\n\nmilt\n\n\n\n"
