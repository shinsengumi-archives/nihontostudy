I also wonder what is said about the Gassan swords and their importance relative to this catalogue.  It seem early Gassan works are seldom seen illustrated and therefore not a lot of written material comes out regarding them.  I owned an early Gassan katana until passing on to a good friend here in St. Louis.  Even with a serious lamination fault in the kissaki it received relatively high &quot;points&quot; from the September 2001 NTHK Chicago shinsa who placed it mid-Muromachi.  My friend who now owns the Gassan saw all the illustrations in the catalogue and of course asked me about it, but I haven&#39;t a clue.  Can someone who reads Japanese explain the importance of illustrating the many Hojo and Gassan examples?\n\nRon\nSTL\n\nArnold wrote:\n\nHi:\n  I recently got back from Japan and while there found a copy of the new\ncatalog from the Sano Museum in Shizuoka. It is titled An Early Style of A\nJapanese Sword: a search for the origin of the curve. It is 9 x 12, 140\npp, and covers 59 different types of swords from five warabite-to, through\nthe koto era with most being Heian, Kamakura and Nanbokucho. Each is\nillustrated with excellent photographs of the entire blade, monouchi and\nnakago, and oshigata too of each blade.  \n Nothing is more important than shape both as a kantei starting point and\nthe one characteristic that makes Japanese swords - through its impact on\ncutting efficiency - different from all others. I would dearly love to be\nable to read the text, but that awaits translation. There are not less\nthan 10 Hoju swords illustrated and 10 Gassan, and the former is little\ndiscussed in the literature. In that those two near-by groups account for\na third of the illustrations there must be some real importance to them in\nshape determination, but I don&#39;t have a clue what it is!\n The Sano recently did two great shows, with catalogs, one on Rai and one\non Soshu, but something tells me this is by far the more important catalog\ninformationally.\n I believe Chris Bowen posted a couple of months ago that he was a source\nfor the catalog, and there are probably others.\n\n\n\nArnold Frenzel\nafrenzel@...\n\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
