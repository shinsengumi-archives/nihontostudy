I don&#39;t know what the subscriber counts are, but the nearly com=\r\nplete\nlack of traffic tells the story. The Nihonto Message Board is where t=\r\nhe\naction and the collectors are, for the most part.\n\nI did close my busine=\r\nss for health reasons, and my remaining Asia-related\nstock is being handled=\r\n by Paragon Books, but I recently found a few\n&quot;stragglers&quot; that I&#39;ll be off=\r\nering on NMB.
