This dipstick has just seen\nthe second picture.  Sighhh...  I plead alcoholic indulgence after a long and\nexciting day...\n\nThe second picture reinforces my earlier expressed opinion - note the bad ware\nat the yokote (a crack, heaven forbid), while the poorly polished kissaki\nsuggests that the boshi &quot;runs out&quot;.  The only change I would make to my earlier\nexpressions is that the sword could be (could be!!) Sue Koto.  However, from\nwhat I can see the sword is still &quot;no chop&quot;and the nakago suggests this sword is\no-suriage mumei!!!  Which reinforces the observation that a poor sword is a poor\nsword whenever it was made.  Here I must say that I&#39;m talking about the Sword as\nArt, not whether it is a good cutter on the Sengoku Jidai battlefield.  Given\nall this, IMHO the red-lacquered inscription is of academic interest only...\n\nRegards again,\n\nBarry Thomas.\n\n"
