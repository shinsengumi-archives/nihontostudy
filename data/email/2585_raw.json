There was a several week period in both cases of me having to\nfight people who&#39;s computer screens told them something that wasn&#39;t\ntrue, then finally they admitted the package vanished into thin air.\n\nLast year they searched the warehouse several times without it turning\nup, and when I said I was sending the police over, 15 minutes later the\nsword appeared in some office where someone had &quot;mistakenly left it&quot;\nafter scanning that it was sent to customs.\n\nMy hope is that the same scam is being played again.\n\nObviously with the cost of a blade like this, it is not a trivial matter\nand I feel kind of sick. Insurance says they will not cover it. \n\nPictures of the blade are on my site as I have the paperwork.\n\nIt has gone missing or been stolen in the Toronto area. Lately there\nhas been a new study group formed in Toronto with a lot of attendees. It\nis possible with the new dissemination of information there that there\nis more knowledge about the value of these swords and so we&#39;re going to\nstart seeing more thefts. \n\nHere&#39;s the link to my site:\n\nhttp://www.nihonto.ca/yukimitsu-2/\n\nPlease, everyone be on the lookout for someone who is asking questions\nabout an antique sword that they have found, and are trying to get the\nvalue of that matches the pictures and description on my site. If\nsomeone presents it to you in person, please take it and call the police\nimmediately.\n\n- darcy\n\n\n\n"
