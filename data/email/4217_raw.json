I guess their income must be way higher than\n&gt; mine. Also, I \n&gt; think I&#39;m going to start selling books on eBay and\n&gt; then just ship \n&gt; them straight from Amazon, pocketing the difference.\n&gt; \n&gt; The added twist is that I&#39;m sure most of these books\n&gt; on polishing \n&gt; have resulted in good blades being damaged by people\n&gt; who think it&#39;s \n&gt; as easy as sharpening the steak knives at home.\n&gt; Polishing should be \n&gt; left to professionals.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks for listening (reading) to my rant.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best Regards,\n&gt; \n&gt; Andres\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?
