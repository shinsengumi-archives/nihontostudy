This list and a shinsa  \nshould be a serious opportunity for learning. I hope that people can  \nlearn from a shinsa. I also encourage everyone to ask questions.  \nThere were too few people who picked up their pieces and did not ask  \nfor an explanation. Next time, if there is one for you, ask the guy  \ntaking your money to call me over. I will be happy, or not, to  \nexplain anything you want to know. That is why we are doing a shinsa.  \nNot to make you feel bad, but to try and share some knowledge with  \nyou. If I was hard on Ted, I am sorry. If Ted would like to contact  \nme off line, I would be happy to help him understand his results. We  \nare doing another shinsa in Chicago next April. Please use this  \nopportunity to learn. Also, if anyone would like to volunteer to help  \nout along with Milt, let me know and you can share in the process.\n\nGordon\n\nOn Sep 7, 2006, at 11:46 AM, nihontochicken wrote:\n\n&gt; --- In nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Ron Hartmann&quot; &lt;swords@...&gt;  \n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Anyone got anything to report on the sword show and shinsa that took\n&gt; &gt; place this past weekend???\n&gt;\n&gt; Yeah, the judges were entirely unreasonable and were pinking juyo\n&gt; quality swords.
