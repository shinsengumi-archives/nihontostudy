I happen to have seen\n&gt; Hagawa-san making &quot;cat scratches&quot;...\n&gt; ...the marks are made with a special tool...\n\nI have never thought much about the techniques of making habaki (having simply\nadmired great work), so this is an interesting observation of Peter&#39;s.  This\nwould make a habaki where the whole surface is covered with short excusions\nending in a &quot;burr&quot; - like some cruder WW2 gunto habaki I have seen, but the\n&quot;burrs&quot; are plainly put in individually rather than with a multiple-toothed\ntool.  However, I&#39;m sure there are many different techniques for making the\nnekogaki/amegaki.  I had in mind those where the &quot;burr&quot; clearly occurs at the\nend of a longer excursion or cut made (I guess) with a burin-like instrument,\nhence the &quot;burrs&quot; are rather sparse in number compared to the technique Pete\ndescribed.  Interestingly, the solid silver habaki on Showa period Gassan swords\nhas a pattern of &quot;burrs&quot; in a repeated square arrangement.  I could put up an\nimage if any one wants to see it.\n\nBarry Thomas.\n\n\n"
