The &#39;Bushido&#39; magazines \n  from Robert Benson (1980&#39;s) had a lot of great information, and the \n  1976 Tai Kai from San Francisco book has a lot of information also (I \n  believe there&#39;s a copy at Bridge of Dreams).  They show up on Ebay \n  from time to time also.\n       What I was referring to with the kozuka was the effect of \n  removing of gold revealing the substrate for effent, which you can \n  see better there than on the menuki where there is definatley wear \n  involved also.  Ezo menuki were fabricated on a positive mould from \n  thin copper sheet, then the gold was applied using a mercury \n  technique (probably heat evaporation), then burnished with a needle \n  to get the effect.  Uttori by definition is attachment of the inly \n  around the edges only, although I would imagine there is some form of \n  burnishing or other form of adhesion involved as well.  As far as the \n  wear to the menuki, hell, I hope I look that good when I&#39;m that old!\n\n  Pete\n\n  PS:  I have a feeling they are older than Edo due to the posts both \n  being open -- possibly Jim would know?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  --- In nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Barry Thomas&quot; &lt;warlord@...&gt; \n  wrote:\n  &gt;\n  &gt; I have been aware for a few years that the deliberate rubbing of \n  gold to look\n  &gt; worn is a well-established part of the metal workers&#39; repetoire.  I \n  believe it\n  &gt; is meant to impart an &quot;antique&quot; look, or maybe it&#39;s that &quot;wabi-\n  sabi&quot; serpent\n  &gt; rearing its ugly head again.  Either way, if an item looks to be of \n  good quality\n  &gt; and in good condition AND the gold looks worn, then it is more \n  likely to be a\n  &gt; deliberate effect and original and NOT a &quot;condition problem&quot;.  I \n  would sure like\n  &gt; to know more about this.\n  &gt; \n  &gt; Regards,\n  &gt; \n  &gt; Barry Thomas.\n  &gt; \n  &gt; ----- Original Message -----\n  &gt; From: &quot;bungotakadasword&quot; &lt;MuramasaIII@...&gt;\n  &gt; To: &lt;nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n  &gt; Sent: Tuesday, May 30, 2006 10:21 AM\n  &gt; Subject: [nihontostudy] Re: Post dated Post Update (LOL)\n  &gt; \n  &gt; \n  &gt; --- In nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com, &quot;klepet33319&quot; &lt;Ppeterdds@&gt;\n  &gt; wrote:\n  &gt; &gt;\n  &gt; &gt; http://www.aoi-art.com/fittings/menuki/itaku04.html\n  &gt; &gt;\n  &gt; &gt; &quot; the color was toned with the technique called Suri-hagashi, \n  covered\n  &gt; gold was deliberately rubbed off. &quot;........\n  &gt; \n  &gt; this is interesting, sure it&#39;s not &quot; condition problem &quot; ?
