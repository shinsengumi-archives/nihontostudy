So how much sori is\n&gt; too\n&gt; much??\n&gt;\n&gt; I mean it is quite pleasing to the eye, very appealing in fact but it sorta\n&gt; looks like a caricature of a sword.\n&gt;\n&gt; The sori is tori-sori nice and even the length of the blade, so in keeping\n&gt; with that I went ahead and curved the nakago to match the sori in the blade\n&gt; to stay with the &quot;lines&quot; of the sword...\n&gt;\n&gt; It is in mid polish right now and once I get it mounted I will post some\n&gt; pics... I am amazed that the thing held together in the quench as it was\n&gt; moaning and groaning and dancing around while it was in the tank but I\n&gt; didn&#39;t\n&gt; hear one &quot;Tink&quot; or &quot;Toink&quot; and no cracks are coming up and I am at 800\n&gt; grit on the polish (I don&#39;t use stones..I am doing this for book IV and am\n&gt; using available abrasives that just about anyone can get...and I must\n&gt; say I am\n&gt; getting some really nice results on the blades I am making...)\n&gt;\n&gt; So did I make an abomination with 1 1 /2&quot; of sori??? This should cut really\n&gt; well with that much curve but I dunno...\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks all!!\n&gt;\n&gt; JPH\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Dr JP Hrisoulas, COL NANG (Ret)\n&gt; Bladesmith.\n&gt; Author: The Complete Bladesmith\n&gt; The Master Bladesmith\n&gt; The Pattern Welded Blade\n&gt; http: _www.atar.com_ (http://www.atar.com/)\n&gt;\n\n\n"
