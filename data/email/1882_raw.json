Having the tsuba in-hand would of course make for a stronger argument fo=\r\nr (or against) the groups mentioned, I would think. \n\nMaybe I shouldn&#39;t had=\r\n called the edge treatment &quot;bones&quot; but it would be the lines visiable from =\r\nthe three-fold construction of Akasaka. Last year I purchased a wonderful &quot;=\r\nwillow tree&quot; iron sukashi tsuba, mumei--one of my &quot;dream&quot; tsuba ever since =\r\nSasano illustrated this motif in his sukashi tsuba book. I felt it was Akas=\r\naka and it did have these linear lines (bones?) in its edge.

It definitely is kiri, not wy=\r\nsteria motif. If\n  Akasaka I would expect to see some linear &quot;bones&quot; in the=\r\n edge of the\n  tsuba from folding. I can see Akasaka or as you said, Tosa M=\r\nyochi...or\n  dare I say Higo, Nishigaki work perhaps?
