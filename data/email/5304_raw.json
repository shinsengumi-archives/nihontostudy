There aren&#39;t different attributions for the different parts of the\nEdo period. The NTHK does assign a period within Edo for every fitting or\nkoshirae paper:\n\n\u001b$B=i4|\u001b(B Shoki (the beginning)\n\n\u001b$BA04|\u001b(B Zenki (the first part)\n\n\u001b$BCf4|\u001b(B Chuki (the middle)\n\n\u001b$B8e4|\u001b(B Koki (late)\n\n\u001b$BKv4|\u001b(B Baki (the end)\n\nThe NBTHK does not.\n\nI can&#39;t even guess at a group on the tombo menuki, and that is the way it is\nwith the Kyo-kinko attribution. I didn&#39;t see them in Tampa, but based on the\nphotos they look like late Edo work.\n\nAgreed with Gordon&#39;s earlier comment that there are plenty of early solid\ngold menuki, including Ko-mino and Ko-Kinko work in addition to Goto. The\nrecent NBTHK AB display and lecture at Tampa included several pairs of solid\ngold mainline Goto menuki from the Muromachi and early Edo periods.\n\nJim\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: Ron Hartmann\nTo: nihontostudy@ &lt;mailto:nihontostudy%40yahoogroups.com&gt; yahoogroups.com\nSent: Wednesday, February 27, 2008 7:31 PM\nSubject: Re: [nihontostudy] Kyo-kinko\n\nJim -\n\nYou may have seen these in Tampa but here is a link showing the menuki that\nI was asking about:\nhttp://www.nihonto. &lt;http://www.nihonto.\n&lt;http://www.nihonto.com/11.3.07.html&gt; com/11.3.07.html&gt; com/11.3.07.html\n\nPapered as Kyo-kinko, maybe these fall into that area as you mentioned where\nit is difficult to &quot;date&quot; them or to assign a maker.

It is often applied to work that is in Goto style but is not Goto\nmain or sideline work. Edo-kinko used to be used similarly for work in the\nstyle of Edo region machibori kinko schools, but lately this is generally\nlumped as &quot;Kyo-kinko&quot; as well. So it truly is a grab bag, but the problem\n(especially with menuki) is that there is so much Edo period kinko work with\nno unique character to it that makes it possible to give a more specific\nattribution.\n\nBTW, generic Edo period kinko work of lower quality than Kyo-kinko is\nattributed to Kyo-kanagushi.\n\nJim\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: ROBSON Gordon\nTo: nihontostudy@ &lt;mailto:nihontostudy%40yahoogroups.com&gt; yahoogroups.com\nSent: Wednesday, February 27, 2008 4:23 PM\nSubject: Re: [nihontostudy] Kyo-kinko\n\nHi Ron,\n\nMy understanding is that Kyo-Kinko is the new name for Waki-Goto. This would\n\nmake them a grab bag like Ko-Kinko or even Shoami. Their dates are post-Ko-\nKinko, so early Edo to Bakumatsu. There is a Kyo-Kinko book out there. I\nthink the\ntitle is Kyo-Kinko no Kenkyu (research into Kyo-Kinko) or something like\nthat. Jim\nis probably better up on this stuff then I am.\n\nOn on different note, good luck to Harry.
