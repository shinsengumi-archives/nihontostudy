But I think we\nshould be careful of it.  I still have a jar full of wax that Tom\nButtweiler sold me. Since he has been dead for a long time, it must be 20\nyears old. I never use it any more. At it best, it is a short-term fix that\nreally does a nice job of spiffing up a rusty iron guard. Tom used to carry\nthe stuff to gun shows and such and use shine up rusty tsuba so that he\ncould turn them around quickly. It seems to deal well with red rust and\nscale. I have to believe that it builds up over time, tho, so I think it\nwould not be a good regular treatment.\nPeter Bleed\n\n\n"
