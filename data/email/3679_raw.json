The myoga and matsukawabishi don&#39;t normally have anything to do with the musashino design.  They&#39;re rather common decorative devices for &quot;making&quot; hitsuana and were probably originally introduced as mon but then became part of the tsuba designer&#39;s vocabulary.\n\nYou&#39;re probably right about it being Owari.  There are Owari guards with very Akasaka-esq designs that predate Akasaka.  The seppa dai is quite broad at both the top and bottom.  The rim isn&#39;t very rounded.  The texture of the metal and the carving don&#39;t really fit Akasaka.  The hitsuana treatment would be rather unusual for Akasaka.  Looks like a nice guard.\n\nJim  \n\n\n\n  Seasons greeting. Just back from holidays and arrived home to a new \n  piece for the collection. I purchased this guard as Ko Akasaka from a \n  trusted seller in Japan. I believe though that it is Owari. It has \n  outstanding colour and iron I think and is in wonderful condition. I \n  would put this as early Edo but happy to be corrected. There is a \n  similar tsuba listed in the Tsuba Taikan dated to the mid 1400&#39;s. It has \n  a great masashino theme but I am unsure of the relationship of the \n  ginger leaves and mon or pine tree as the hitsu ana. I have started to \n  wonder, as they have straight bars coming from both, if they are both \n  mon and in fact, war fans meeting on the grassy battle field. Anyway, \n  that&#39;s just some fanciful thought. Here are some images.\n\n  http://www.nihontomessageboard.com/tsuba_collection/owari-masashino.jpg\n\n  http://www.nihontomessageboard.com/tsuba_collection/owari-masashino-1.jpg\n\n  http://www.nihontomessageboard.com/tsuba_collection/owari-masashino-2.jpg\n\n  It also has very fine running tekkotsu in the mimi, a lot like another \n  Edo Owari guard I have, just not as pronounced. This is the other mimi.\n\n  http://www.nihontomessageboard.com/tsuba_collection/owari-mimi.jpg\n\n  Any thoughts or comments would be appreciated.\n\n  Note: the scan of the new tsuba makes the patina look a little odd, I am \n  unsure why this is, but it is in tact and very nice.\n\n  Kind regards\n\n  Rich Turner\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
