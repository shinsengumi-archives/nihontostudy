I intend to practice with it. I believe its a \n&gt; shi=\r\nnto blade around 1650. I have a colleague who bought and is \nusing a \n&gt; Kot=\r\no blade. She has had a hi put on by a Japanese smith. They did a \n&gt; beautif=\r\nul job and the few collectira that have seen it have said \nthat it \n&gt; does =\r\nnot detract from the shape and beauty of the sword..\n&gt; Sorry.   Enore\n\nHi E=\r\nnore,\n\nI rarely post here, but your message makes me feel obliged to respon=\r\nd.\n\nI can agree (to some extent) with an opinion that swords were made to \n=\r\nbe used rather than for appreciation only. However, as you seem to \npractic=\r\ne sword arts, think about that: various ancient swordsmanship \nschools, met=\r\nhods, techniques were also created for active use \n(particularly - in battl=\r\ne), not for any sort of appreciation or \nsamurai-style fitness exercises. H=\r\nowever it is considered a horrible \nmisconduct (among serious practitioners=\r\n) to change the authentic \ntechniques for a reason of &#39;adapting it for ones=\r\nelf&#39; or even thinking \nthat &#39;certain technique is meant to be this way, not=\r\n the way old \nteachers were doing it (for centuries)&#39;. I would say this pri=\r\nnciple \ncan well be applied to old swords: while created to be used, they a=\r\nre \nnot for change (unless in damaged condition) or unless your skills \nbec=\r\nome equal or higher than skills of old masters.\n\nPractice sword supplies ar=\r\ne plentiful at the moment. You may even \norder one to be made _exactly_ how=\r\n you want it to be. I would agree \nwith others: please please please leave =\r\nthe sword unchanged. If it&#39;s \ntoo heavy/too long/too short - it&#39;s just not =\r\nfor you (for your \npractice). If you feel like training with old nihonto (t=\r\no be frank I \ndon&#39;t support this idea and neither did different sensei I me=\r\nt), find \nthe sword which fits your hands as is, without change. I personal=\r\nly \ndo sometimes unsheath one of my swords to do a couple of slow cuts in \n=\r\nthe air to &#39;get this feeling back&#39; ;-) But I would never consider \nusing it=\r\n on a regular basis (or any basis) in training - well made \niaito is enough=\r\n.\n\nAnother reason it&#39;s not recommended is safety. Regardless how well \npres=\r\nerved it looks, you simply don&#39;t know the history of this sword. \nAs somebo=\r\ndy mentioned earlier it could have been treated with \nsome &#39;cosmetic surger=\r\ny&#39; or even just have a natural flaw which didn&#39;t \nappear (yet) because the =\r\nsword was _never_ used. By the way, adding \nbo-hi would only increase that =\r\nrisk.\n\nKind Regards,\nStan\n\n\n\n"
