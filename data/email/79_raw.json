Here&#39;s a\ndescription taken from an eBay listing of the two-vlume set:  \n\n&quot;&quot;This is a dictionary of artistic theme on kodogu.  Each kodogu (menuki,\nfuchi, kashira, kozuka) and tsuba has an artistic theme (i.e., what it\ntries to depict), and this &quot;dictionary&quot; attempts to list them all. Volume\nI: Japanese and Chinese historical and legendary people, events, and\nplaces. Volume II: things, animals, and plants. For each theme the\ndictionary gives: a) the name by which the theme is known; b) detailed\ndescription of the theme; and c) photo plate(s) of work(s) (mostly tsuba,\nsome kodogu) on which the theme is depicted.&quot;&quot;\n\nI don&#39;t have the set with me to see if they explain the &quot;meaning&quot; of each\nanimal, but I am sure the author touches upon it in the description.\n \n\nMike Y.\n\n\nAt 10:36 PM 4/26/2003 +0200, you wrote:\n&gt;Hi guys,\n&gt; \n&gt;Does anyone have a book or a list of all the different animals found on\n&gt;tsuba and other sword furniture, and their meaning ?\n&gt; \n&gt;I know quite alot about symbolism in Chinese art, but so far they seem\n&gt;to be quite different to the Japanese. \n&gt; \n&gt;- Matt\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n"
