Obviously they were not drawn from the saya like katana.  I suspect that they may have been carried more for intimidation value than for effectiveness as a battlefield weapon, but I&#39;ll have to defer to Tom and the other swordsmen on that.  I suppose that they are not so different from a long pole arm.\n\nJim\n\n\n  I think you would be correct. Weren&#39;t most really long swords made for\n  some festival ? I recall reading about that somewhere.\n\n  - Matt\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
