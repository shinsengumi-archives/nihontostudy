I started to wonder if I missed something on the news that caused a melt-down of the sword groups or something. Hmmm...let&#39;s see what I can toss out there to talk about. \n\nAnyone ever studied the &quot;dating&quot; of Bingo Mihara swords using the full &quot;Bingo&quot; province name v/s the abreviated form of &quot;Bishu?&quot; I recall this being mentioned in NBTHK&#39;s Token Bijutsu a decade or so ago. One reason I ask is that I&#39;m (eventually) going to write something for the JSS/US on a couple Bingo Mihara swords. \n\nRon\nSTL\n\n\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: Andres Pedraza \n  To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Wednesday, November 09, 2005 5:51 PM\n  Subject: Re: [nihontostudy] Testing...no reply necessary\n\n\n  We are all meditating.
