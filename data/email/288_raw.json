That thickness was seen in some of the ca. Nanbokucho examples, but this isn&#39;t so old.  I&#39;ve never seen a fukurin done exactly like that, but I&#39;m guessing that it is depicting the layers of leather underneath.  The idea of o-seppa was turned into metal facing plates?  I could be way off -- a photo showing the inside of the nakago ana (like Keith took of his nagamaki guard) would prove or disprove the idea.  Not the highest quality workmanship, but an interesting guard.  Maybe I just have kawa on the brain today.\n\nJim\n\n\n\n  Hi all, a member on another list has been trying to get an answer on \n  this tsuba, it also apears to be layers though I am sure that is just an \n  effect of the craftsmanship but it is pretty thick and rather interesting.\n\n  Any thoughts on this one ?\n\n  Rich\n\n  http://homepage.ntlworld.com/helen.hall3/sword1.jpg\n  http://homepage.ntlworld.com/helen.hall3/tsuba1.jpg\n  http://homepage.ntlworld.com/helen.hall3/tsuba2.jpg\n\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
