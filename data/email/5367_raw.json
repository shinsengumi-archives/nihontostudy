The &quot;kiri&quot; of course has the three &quot;blooms&quot; and the &quot;ivy&quot;=\r\n does \nnot. Check out p.37, particularly the left column, third up. I think=\r\n \nthat&#39;s it. As for the other sukashi designs between the &quot;ivy,&quot; could \nbe =\r\nanybody&#39;s guess. \n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ve added another photo to my file, one with a blac=\r\nk background if \nanyone&#39;s interested in looking. Its a little more realisti=\r\nc (patina). \n&gt; \n&gt; Ron\n&gt; STL\n&gt; \n&gt;   ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt;   From: =\r\nRon Hartmann \n&gt;   To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n&gt;   Sent: Wednesday, Ma=\r\nrch 19, 2008 7:50 PM\n&gt;   Subject: Re: [nihontostudy] Re: Tsuba kantie\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt;   Thanks John. The 3-leaf sukashi (if that what it is) does \nresemble ki=\r\nri leaves but I wanted to hear that from somebody else. \nThe strange patina=\r\n is just the quality of the photo...probably a \nscan. Oddly, that off-color=\r\n shows up the black lacquer, at least I \nthink that&#39;s what I&#39;m seeing on th=\r\ne posted view. I find this rather \nfascinating little tsuba, my reason for =\r\nseeking some feedback from \nfresh eyes. \n&gt; \n&gt;   I&#39;m going to send a couple =\r\n&quot;tests&quot; out after this email. Strange, \nmy nihontostudy email and yahoo ema=\r\nil both came back here and was \ndumped into my spam folder.

Looks brassy c=\r\noloured in \nareas. \n&gt;     Lighting probably, eh? The sukashi look to be kir=\r\nimon in shape. \nDon&#39;t \n&gt;     know about the ovals.

It is i=\r\nron sukashi work of a very unusual \n(undescribable, \n&gt;     to me) shape and=\r\n design. It measures 70mm x 58mm x 6mm and has \n&gt;     remnants of black lac=\r\nquer remaining on it. The hitsu-ana \npillows are \n&gt;     interesting in that=\r\n hey are double-layered, the inside inlay \nbeing \n&gt;     shakudo with a silv=\r\ner overlaid plate. The tsuba has not been \ncut \n&gt;     down so this is its o=\r\nriginal shape, in my opinion. Obviously it \nhas \n&gt;     been refitted many t=\r\nimes.
