These are worn by unarmored and otherwise unarmed monks, lightly armored footsoldiers also armed with naginata, and even by a few elaborately armored mounted and unmounted warriors sporting tachi and bow or naginata.\n\nThese &quot;uchigatana&quot; have no no tsuba.  The tachi appear to be mounted with typical mokko-gata nerikawa tsuba of the period.  The lower status individuals carry naginata without tsuba and the higher carry naginata with rather small guards.  There are no &quot;O-dachi&quot; depicted.\n\nThe drawing of the arms and armor appears to be accurate enough to be worth study.  It is of course only one data point, but it is one that I haven&#39;t seen exhibited before.\n\nJim\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
