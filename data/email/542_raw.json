I think that you are correct that gomoku zogan is quite late, I think perhaps even later than late Edo.  However, the plates that it is applied to can be as old as Muromachi period.  I have seen some fairly nice early tsuba (including Saotome work) covered with gomoku zogan and wondered about what the condition of the plate would be after removing the stuff.  I haven&#39;t tried it, though.  \n\nThe decoration was probably added to jazz up older or plain iron tsuba.  I don&#39;t know if there was a domestic market for them or if they were only made for sale to foreigners.  It&#39;s not a particularly desirable type, and I doubt that there was any school associated with their production.  I haven&#39;t given up on Mito Shoami yet, BTW, but haven&#39;t had any time to work on them.  Tsuba Taikan is sitting on my desk with a book mark on page 246.\n\nJim\n\n\n\n  We&#39;ve been having a discussion on gomoku zogan tsuba on the\n  other yahoo group. I noted that there have been a lot of\n  minty ones on ebay lately and wondering if they are being\n  repro-ed.\n\n  Also as to their age. One seller on ebay said Muromachi.\n  All the books that I recall say late Edo. One Torigoye\n  books says they are poor tsuba and to stay away from from\n  The Shinchu Zogan Tsuba book that covers Onin, Heianjo (mostly),\n  Yoshiro and Ko-Shoami shinchu zogan doesn&#39;t mention them nor\n  picture anything like them.\n\n  What&#39;s the story here? Age? etc. Are these like the &quot;Mito\n  Shoami&quot; tsuba, that really aren&#39;t any particular school.\n  I&#39;ve a daisho in gomoku zogan with Saotome type hammered\n  plates. I like them regardless. Just wondering what they\n  are all about.\n\n  Rich\n  ------------------------------------------------------------\n  Richard Stein, PhD          alchemyst@...\n        \n               The Japanese Sword Index\n    http://www.geocities.com/alchemyst/nihonto.htm\n  ------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
