No doubt it will any moment now...\n--------------------------\nKen,\nThere are signed Aizu Shoami tsuba.  Some of them are fairly good quality, and others are pretty poor.  It&#39;s certainly possible that the &quot;Mito&quot; shiiremono tsuba could be made by Aizu workers, but the workmanship is a bit different from even the low end signed Aizu work.  We&#39;re probably not going to find any signed shiiremono examples to settle the issue.  I think that Aizu Shoami is a better label than Mito Shoami, since we do have documented Shoami makers in Aizu (but not in Mito), but I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s correct.   Ultimately, they&#39;re copying the Nara style.\n\nJim\n\n  Hi all,\n\n  I made one little error in my reporting, I thought the\n  one being auctioned was the same as I saw on the\n  website, but it is different.  This is the one I am\n  referring to in the response as Aizu Shoami which\n  exactly matches my smaller one pictured (which bye the\n  way isn&#39;t small at all).  \n\n  http://www.finesword.co.jp/sale/k081.htm\n\n  The other one pictured on yahoo japan does look more\n  like my larger one sans the shakudo mimi and plugs\n  which all agree is Mito.  It is this one above and its\n  brother in my possesion that Jim G said was possibley\n  Mito Shoami, but the gentleman at finesword said was\n  Aizu Shoami.  I&#39;m hoping that I can get the yahoo\n  japan one cheaply with our cowboy&#39;s help.  It is kind\n  of a cross between the 2.  While it does look like\n  they are done by the same hand, it is still possible\n  that the Aizu were copying the Mito?  Aren&#39;t they near\n  each other location wise ie Northern Japan?  Kind of\n  funny how these all appeared and got me salivating. \n\n  Thanks.\n  Ken\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
