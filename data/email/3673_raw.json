He also makes some comments about disposal of one&#39;s collection. \n\nRon\nSTL\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: Ron Hartmann \n  To: TOKEN ; nihontostudy ; nihonto@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Saturday, January 07, 2006 12:34 PM\n  Subject: [nihontostudy] ukiyo-e Japanese war prints\n\n\n  Hi all -\n\n  Today&#39;s St. Louis Post-Dispatch has an interesting article featuring a local collector of Japanese &quot;war prints&quot; -- woodblock prints -- from the wars with China (1894) and Russia (1904). Not a lot of detail but an interesting write-up neverthless. Thought some of you might enjoy reading it. http://tinyurl.com/8acwl\n\n  Obviously this collector and his wife are upper-crust St.Louisans and probably not too accessible, but it sounds like one day they hope to exhibit their collection which would be nice. Again, just passing it along. I&#39;m sure there are a number of list members who collect such war prints. I&#39;ve always found these interesting but have never allowed myself &quot;another interest.&quot; Have enough!!\n\n  Ron\n  STL\n\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n  SPONSORED LINKS Buy fine art  Japanese translation  Japanese incense  \n        Fine art inkjet paper  Fine art printing  Fine art appraisal  \n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  YAHOO!
