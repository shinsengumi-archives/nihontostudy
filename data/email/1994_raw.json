Today I suddenly remembered, as a kid, reading\nof either a Japanese or Chinese god of batlike face\nthat wore red armor and (possibly multiple hands)\npreferred a bow of tremendous strength. Possibly a God\nof Archery?\n   I&#39;ve been looking in what mythology books I have,\nand trying to research it on the web. I know very\nlittle about Japanese mythology, so I thought this\nmight be a representation of Hachiman, but have had no\nluck in finding supporting evidence or images.\n\nAnyone able to connect the dots for me and tell me\nabout this theme?  --&quot;Toothy bat face character and\nrelated archery theme.&quot;--\n\n\nCurran\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nVote for the stars of Yahoo!&#39;s next ad campaign!\nhttp://advision.webevents.yahoo.com/yahoo/votelifeengine/\n\n"
