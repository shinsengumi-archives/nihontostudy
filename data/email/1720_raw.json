I think that they could be work from Shonai in northern Honshu.  Is the fuchi or tsuba signed?  The kozuka is a later substitution of lower quality.  I can&#39;t really see the menuki in the photos.  The kashira appears to be of a different material.  I&#39;m guessing that it may have been lost and that the tsuka has been rewrapped, but I can&#39;t see much in the photos.\n\nThe bevel on the saya would be up against the body when the sword was worn so it&#39;s probably not just for show.  My guess is that it might be more comfortable to wear or would help position it somehow (?).  It&#39;s an unusual feature.  Does anyone know what it&#39;s called or what it is really for?\n\nAs a lone wakizashi it could have been worn by a non-samurai, but I don&#39;t see anything about the koshirae that would make that necessarily so.  \n\nJim\n\n\n\n\n  Hi,\n\n  Can anyone assist me with this Wakizashi? I&#39;m after more information on the\n  style and school of the mounts. I was told that due to the style of the\n  mounts it would have been a merchants or high class civilian&#39;s sword. Can\n  anyone confirm or deny this?\n  The grove cut into the saya does look to be a kind of fashion statement. The\n  blade is out of polish but looks to have a gunome hamon.\n\n  http://www.c.farrar.btinternet.co.uk/wak/\n\n  Thanks for any assistance anyone can offer!\n\n  Peter\n\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
