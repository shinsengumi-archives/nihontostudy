Work well done and much\n&gt; appreciated.  I have to laugh \n&gt; a bit at the title &#39;Elementary&#39; as it&#39;s very in\n&gt; depth and it really \n&gt; puts into perspective how much there is to learn in\n&gt; this field.  Not \n&gt; being able to read Japanese of course puts so much\n&gt; out of reach for so \n&gt; many of us that work such as yours is most highly\n&gt; valued.  It also puts \n&gt; into perspective just how much scholarship there is\n&gt; in what men like \n&gt; Fukushi accomplish.  I will be looking forward to\n&gt; your future endeavors.\n&gt; Pete Klein\n&gt; PS:  To all -- if you are not a member of the NBTHK\n&gt; AB it is well worth \n&gt; it, IMHO.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?
