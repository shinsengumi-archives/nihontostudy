I couls stick an image up somewhere if any one is interested - it\nwould take me a couple weeks due to pressing committment.  Lovely work, and I\nwas surprised to read the bad vibes about owls.  What then does it signify on a\nkashira that faces toward everybody a samurai would pass as he\nwalked/swaggered/strode/bounced/mooched/slunk along a street??
