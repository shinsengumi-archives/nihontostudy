I bought the Daisho set first and then the \nowner had seen it on the net and then provided the tanto for sale. I \nbelieve that it is great that all 3 pieces are together now. Maybe \nthat they some day may come back to The Tokugawa Museum ? Have been \nlooking at many websites and hae besides NihontoAntiques, as I \nreceived very good recommendation about, - thankyou, also seen www. \nartswords.com owned by Bill Rannow who have many fine things on his \nsite, swords as well as fittings. Does anybody know him or have \nbought something from him. It looks very good to me?.\nRegarding the Tokugawa, I need a little help to translate the \ncorrect mei on the shoto which I translate as Kunifusa. \nUnfortunately I can not differ from Hawleys Kun 34 - 39. I have \ntried to take some good photos of the mei but have not succeeded yet \nand will return for help when I have some good photos. \nI learn a lot from all off you so please continue the lessons, \nthankyou.\nAll the best\nAllan\n\n\n\n\n"
