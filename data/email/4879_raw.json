Bronze cannon were so much easier to \nproduce and less=\r\n likely to fail than iron. The only difference of \nimport at this time is b=\r\nronze was more expensive to use. So, I went \nto a forum where there are som=\r\ne dedicated historians. I paste the \nanswers below.\n \n\nAnyway, this might a=\r\nnswer your question. The book &#39;The Dutch \nDiscovery Of Japan&#39; by Dirk Jan B=\r\narreveld (which is full of errors, \nbut still helpful in gaining an underst=\r\nanding of Dutch trade) states \nthat a report filed by a Jesuit sent to insp=\r\nect the ship says that \nthe ship had &#39;19 pieces of guns made of bronze&#39; (ot=\r\nher sources give \nthe number as 18 or 26). \nFrom Turnbull&#39;s Osaka book-Ieya=\r\nsu had 10 European cannon at the \nbattles of Osaka in 1614-15. 5 were Dutch=\r\n made &#39;Ishibaya&#39; cannons \n(which fired shot ranging from 12 lbs to 35-40 lb=\r\ns-it&#39;s unclear which \ntype Ieyasu had, though). These were likely from the =\r\ncannon taken \nfrom DeLiefde. The other 5 were bought from the English East =\r\nIndia \nCompany and were invoiced by Richard Cocks on December 5, 1614. They=\r\n \nincluded 4 culverins (17.5 lbs) and one saker (5.5 lbs). Out of about \n30=\r\n0 artillery pieces Ieyasu fielded at Osaka, these were the only \nheavy sieg=\r\ne guns apart from one Japanese gun. This was \nthe &#39;Shinbatsuji&#39; gun, which =\r\nwas made by Shibatsuji Ryuemon Sukenobu. \nIt was about 11 feet long with a =\r\n90 mm bore, and fired shot about the \nsame size as small Dutch cannon. Unfo=\r\nrtunately, it&#39;s not noted what \nthey&#39;re made of-the picture of the Japanese=\r\n gun (which is at \nYasukuni) looks like it was bronze. My Japanese books wo=\r\nuld likely \nhave this info, but they&#39;re not here .\n\nAND\n\nSamurai William, p=\r\n.91, states that the Liefde&#39;s cannon were bronze\n\nI still await more inform=\r\nation on possible early sources for \nnambantetsu. I will let you know. It s=\r\neems so far that article has a \nlot of supposition. John\n\n--- In nihontostu=\r\ndy@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Dr John P Lissenden&quot; \n&lt;docliss@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Dear Ba=\r\nrry\n&gt; \n&gt; I was very interested by the article that you posted on namban \nte=\r\ntsu, \n&gt; but am a little unhappy about the implied supposition that cannon \n=\r\nfrom \n&gt; the &#39;De Liefde&#39; were the original source of this metal.\n&gt; \n&gt; I had =\r\nbelieved that bronze - a mixture of 90% copper and 10% tin - \nwas \n&gt; the pr=\r\neferred metal used for the casting of cannon.  Although cast-\niron \n&gt; canno=\r\nn became available ca 1550, these were much more difficult to \n&gt; cast, and =\r\nbronze remained the metal of choice until the mid to late \n&gt; C17.  Since th=\r\ne &#39;De Liefde&#39; arrived in Kyushu in 1600, is it not \nhighly \n&gt; likely that i=\r\nts cannon were of bronze rather than of iron?\n&gt; \n&gt; Is there an expert on ca=\r\nnnon out there somewhere who can clarify \nthis \n&gt; point for me?\n&gt; \n&gt; Regard=\r\ns, John L.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Barry =\r\nThomas&quot; &lt;warlord@&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; All,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve just discovered this =\r\nlittle gem about the history of Namban \n&gt; tetsu (foreign steel) in Japanese=\r\n history and the involvement of \nthe \n&gt; Dutch V.O.C.
