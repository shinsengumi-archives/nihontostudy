Sasano based his discussion on\npaintings, which would indicate there are no extant mounts with these type\nof tsuba on them. I think those mounted on naginata would be easy to spot\nwith their very wide nakago. Definately switched out at some point.\n\nG\n  -----Original Message-----\n  From: tom helm [mailto:junkmail@...]\n  Sent: Saturday, April 26, 2003 9:48 AM\n  To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com\n  Subject: RE: [nihontostudy] tsuba balance\n\n\n  G-\n        I imagine the big early Tosho and katchushi on say naginata\n  much more easily than on tachi, NODACHI maybe...But I don&#39;t think I\n  have seen one mounted. Yes the uchigatana catalog had one, the Nat.\n  Mus. koshirae book has one or two of the smaller tosho. Given the\n  dating of these pieces one can&#39;t argue, however there do seem to be\n  alot of the tosho pieces around that aren&#39;t mounted. Were they\n  switched out? are they from an earlier time?\n        Not sure you or anybody can answer, while the smaller tosho\n  works of the muromachi seem to fit the timeline, to me the big early\n  ones are kind of an anomalous blip on the radar. Then again I am not\n  a kodogu guy...\n  t\n\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n        Yahoo!
