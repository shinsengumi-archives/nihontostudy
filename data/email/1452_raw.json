I was tempted, but didn&#39;t buy.\n\nJim\n\n\n  I might add to this that Kano Natsuo was also a very original designer and\n  the set of books on him (way expensive) that was done by the guys at the\n  fittings museum (I think) included at least one entire volume on his\n  paintings and designs. A bit too specialized for me, but very interesting\nto\n  see how he worked up from paper to metal.\n\n\n\n  Gordon\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n  _____  \n\nYahoo!
