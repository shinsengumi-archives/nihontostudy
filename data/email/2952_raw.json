I know Yoshindo Yoshihara sensei\n&gt; does apparently, and I would love to see some examples of his work. I\n&gt; was thinking about this recently, and wondered about the recipes in the\n&gt; back of the Aesthetic Guide and if anyone still does this stuff. If so,\n&gt; could very good tsuba with minimal damage be repaired and re patinate\n&gt; and if so, how effectively.\n&gt;\n&gt; Right then, foot back in my mouth and over to the experts.\n&gt;\n&gt; cheers\n&gt;\n&gt; Rich Turner\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; -- \n&gt;\n&gt; Richard Turner\n&gt; Nihont� Message Board\n&gt; &lt;http://members5.boardhost.com/Nihon-To/&gt;\n&gt; - /for the discussion and sharing of all things Nihont�/\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
