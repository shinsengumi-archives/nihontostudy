The NTHK, the real one, usually has it&#39;s \nspecial sword appreciation gather at the same time; however, this year \nwe wanted to do something with the Sano Museum in Mishima. \nUnfortunately, Watanabe sensei is not available during the weekend, but \nis available on November 3rd, which is a national holiday in Japan. \nWould delaying our special meeting until three days after the Daitoken \nIchi be a bad idea even given that we will have masterpiece works from \nthe Sano Museum available for hands-on study with lecturing from \nWatanabe sensei? In other words, would those of you planning on \nattending be willing to hang around for four more days or so?\n\nGordon\n\n\n\n\n \nYahoo! Groups Links\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n"
