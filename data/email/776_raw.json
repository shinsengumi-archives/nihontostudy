It would be a great topic for an article in the Bulletin of the Metals Museum.  My impression is that nunome zogan first appears on Japanese sword fittings in the late Muromachi period.  Where it originates is an even harder question, but nunome zogan is strongly associated with Ko-Shoami work and some sources place the origin of the Ko-Shoami in Kyoto.\n\nI have seen some very sophisticated gold and silver inlay on iron from North China ca. 5th-4th C BC, and of course complex Tang metalwork, but I can&#39;t recall nunome type inlay from that time.  As Rich mentioned &quot;nunome&quot; is seen elsewhere in the Middle East and Asia.  I have seen nunome-style inlay on old European material as well.  There is an &quot;Anglo-Scandinavian&quot; iron stirrup in the Metropolitan Museum from the 10-11th C with brass inlay that is affixed with a nunome-type technique.\n\nI have a few pages of notes from Bob Haynes where he records various nunome cross hatching styles seen on tsuba and attempts to correlate them to their various makers. \n\nJim\n\n\n\n  List-eners,\n        Has there been a synthetic study of nunome zogan? This is the\n  Japanese term for the overlay techniques that places gold or silver leaf on\n  steel by rubbing it into/onto very fine cross hatched striations. When well\n  done it is very beautiful, but often it is either entirely gone or survives\n  only as traces. Do we know when and where it originated in Japan? And where\n  else is it practiced?\n  Peter Bleed\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
