Some of you might have \nmeet Dr. Louis Belschner a Dentist from Denver Colorado in the last few \nyears at one of the sword shows as he was selling off his collection.  &lt;&gt; \n\nDr. Belschner passed away late last year and the family has ask me to \nsell his remaining swords, tsuba and books. &lt;&gt; \n\nDr. Belschner was a good friend and I always had a good time when I \nvisited him in Denver. Over the last 25 years I have bought a number of \nblades from him and he bought a number of blades from me.  One of the \nfirst blades I bought from him was a nice shin-shinto with dragon \nhorimono.  At the time he wanted $500 cash for the blade.  And I sure \nwanted that blade.  I had to call my wife and talk her into wiring me \nthe cash as I did not have that amount.  It took all day but I walked \naway with the blade very happy.  The blade was in good polish to my very \nbeginning eyes but I could not understand why there were dips in the \nblade between the large gunome.  Turns out that he had used his dental \ntools to clean up the blade and the softer metal above the hamon was \nremoved faster than the hardened edge.  I wonder what happened to that \nblade after I sold it? &lt;&gt; \n\nIf you would like a list of items that I have to sell please email me at \njswords@... &lt;mailto:jswords@...&gt; . &lt;&gt; \n\nThanks for your time\nDavid McDonald\n\n-- \nDavid McDonald                  Collector of Japanese Swords and Old Iron \nPO Box 265                      WEB page - http://www.montanairon.com \nSidney MT  59270                email - jswords@... \n406-482-3243  evenings          I do tsukamaki (wrapping of sword hilts) \n\nOwner of White IH Cub & Super A Farmall, IH 100 & 130, 140, AC G  \nMcD type M, Monitor, Frost King and other stationary engines. \n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
