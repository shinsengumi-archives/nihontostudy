Nice tsuba.\n\nJohn\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: Jim Gilbert \n  To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Friday, May 23, 2003 12:06 PM\n  Subject: Re: [nihontostudy] fuji, mon and tsuba\n\n\n  John and Tom,\n  I agree with what you&#39;re saying, but remember that if the tsuba is flipped front-back, then the sukashi is hidden when worn as a tachi and revealed when worn as a katana.  I only have a photo of the tsuba, so I flipped it in Photoshop and added it to the album.  Does looking at the other side change the leaning of your reading?\n\n  The kozuka I posted is mine and when I hand it to people they invariably orient it with the leaves at the bottom and the flower growing up.  Apparently that looks natural to most people, including me until I realized that it was a wisteria (and that the opening for the blade is on the normal end when the flower is positioned hanging down).  \n\n  BTW, the piece is 83.4 mm diameter, 3.3 mm thick at the seppa dai, 2.2  mm thick at the mimi.\n  Jim\n\n\n    Hi Jim;\n\n    Interesting question.\n\n    I looked at the pictures for a long while, and tried to imagine the tsuba being mounted and in an oncoming position as if it was mounted and worn.\n\n    To my eye it looks more natural if mounted on a tachi with the ha pointing down.\n\n    If mounted on a katana the sukashi is hidden against the clothing and body and just does not seem right.\n\n    I think it would work either way however, just looks better mounted as a tachi.\n\n    John\n\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n        Yahoo!
