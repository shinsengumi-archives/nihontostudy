Certainly it was later adopted by many other groups around the country and some of those like Ito, Choshu and Kinai were bigger producers in the mid to late Edo period.  Probably in some cases the work of those groups can be confused, but the iron, carving and inlay work tend to be a bit different.  \n\nJim\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Jim - My fault for citing Hamilton - you are of course right and have \n  pointed this out in past...I do like the tsuba pictured at the bottom \n  of plate cited for being similar in treatment of the birds, rim, and \n  negative space.\n\n  I&#39;m interested to read the comparison of Milt&#39;s tsuba with the initial \n  example.\n\n  The range of Shoami work being so broad, and my expectation that this \n  is 1700s or later has me wonder if like many Shoami attributed pieces, \n  that it follows the work of another school...Comments?\n\n  Michael\n\n  http://www.satcho.com Specialists in books related to the study & \n  appreciation of the Japanese sword as art. \n  _______________________________________________\n\n  --- In nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com, &quot;bungotakadasword&quot; \n  &lt;MuramasaIII@...&gt; wrote:\n  &gt;\n  &gt; a signed example of Shoami......\n  &gt; \n  &gt; http://www.esnips.com/web/tsuba?docsPage=15#files\n  &gt; \n  &gt; milt\n  &gt;\n\n\n\n   \n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
