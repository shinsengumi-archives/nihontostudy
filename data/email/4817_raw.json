The &#39;nick&#39; in the ha will \ncause eit=\r\nher major change in geometry or necessitate shortening \n(machi okuri).  By =\r\nthe time you&#39;re done you will have at least $3000 \nand two to three years i=\r\nnto the project and a blade which might only \nbe worth a fraction of that c=\r\nost.  What would probably be the best \nbet would be running some very good =\r\npictures past a good polisher to \nfind out if it&#39;s worth it.\nJust my two ce=\r\nnts.\n\n\n\n--- In nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Ron Hartmann&quot; &lt;swords@...&gt; \nw=\r\nrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Becky, all - \n&gt; \n&gt; It is interesting that when offering a &quot;mounte=\r\nd&quot; sword of this \nquality that people will want to pay less than if you wou=\r\nld break it \napart and sell the blade and fittings seperately. Not quite su=\r\nre what \nthat is but I&#39;ve more than a few times have (as most of us have) s=\r\nold \noff fittings seperately from the sword. (Unless, I should add, the \nsw=\r\nord is nicely mounted in a relatively complete and intact \nkoshirae.) \n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n As for a sword like this being worth much more after \nbeing &quot;appraised, do=\r\ncumented or auctioned,&quot; one has to realize that \nthese directions take mone=\r\ny to do these things. I&#39;m not sure what a \nreliable appraiser would charge =\r\ntoday but for a stateside &quot;paper&quot; you \nwould pay around $250; to send a swo=\r\nrd to Japan it might run $1,200 \n(Tokubetsu Hozon) after you are finished w=\r\nith shipping and fees and \nregistrations. Auction houses charge seller fees=\r\n and catalogue fees. \nNothing comes cheap! \n&gt; \n&gt; Just rattling on a bit...\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; Ron\n&gt; STL\n&gt; \n&gt;   ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt;   From: BECKY WALLACE=\r\n \n&gt;   To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n&gt;   Sent: Saturday, January 06, 200=\r\n7 4:36 PM\n&gt;   Subject: [nihontostudy] Becky&#39;s Sword\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   I&#39;d like to t=\r\nhank everyone who has been helping me with Japanese \nSword info lately. We =\r\ndid go to the Gun show here in Dallas today. \nSold the WWII Japanese rifle =\r\nwe had - it was not a very good piece \nand I&#39;m glad to have it out of the c=\r\nloset. Had several people look at \nthe sword. The blade, as has been pointe=\r\nd out by some of you, was not \nsigned and it has one nick that is slightly =\r\ntoo big to be polished \nout, which detracts considerably from the value. Th=\r\nere was concurance \nthat this sword was made in the 1600s and is a Washika =\r\n(spelling) the \nshoter sword. Everyone liked the tsuba, end cap and collar.=\r\n I got \noffered about $500 for the tsuba and $100 each for the collar and e=\r\nnd \ncap, but just $300 for the whole thing! The conclusion I came to was \nt=\r\nhat a gun show was really more like a giant pawn shop than the place \nto re=\r\nally get a fair assessment of value, but it was very \ninteresting, I ran in=\r\nto at least 3 of my co-workiers from Lockheed \nwho had booths, and I did co=\r\nme\n&gt;   away knowing a few things: 1. the sword is old and really not in \nba=\r\nd shape - I can continue to use it in the event of an intruder and \ncould p=\r\nrobably take one out with it - I&#39;m not a handgun fan :-) 2. If \nI really ha=\r\nd it appraised, documented, or auctioned, I&#39;d get $1500 or \nso for it, 3. I=\r\n like it more than that so will be keeping it for the \nforseeable future. I=\r\n&#39;ll probably drop out of this group in a few \nweeks having accomplished my =\r\nmission, but thanks for the education. I \ncan sure see how this could becom=\r\ne a very interesting hobby.\n&gt; \n&gt;   Becky\n&gt; \n&gt;   [Non-text portions of this =\r\nmessage have been removed]\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;    \n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this m=\r\nessage have been removed]\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"
