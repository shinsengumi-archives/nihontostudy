My sayashi friend says it \nwould realy add the $$ if someone wanted him to make a saya with \ncarve outs for those tools.  \n\nAre there any examples of kogai or kozuka mounted on a tachi??  Any \nidea when these tools first began to appear??  Trying to get a \ncomplete picture of a 14th century samurai is tough.  Especially for \nthe lower samurai ranks, and the lowly ashigaru with their naginata, \nyari, and uchikatanna.  Sure is fun though.\n\nas an aside, i also am glad Jim Kurrasch&#39;s site is still up.  Lots of \ngood stuff there.\n\nthanks for the help with my minor mystery, guys.\n\ndoug e.\n In nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com, Kenneth Wilson &lt;kdw21620@y...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; coincidently I found this on the subject searching for\n&gt; something else\n&gt; \n&gt; http://www.trocadero.com/dragondance/items/156717/item156717.html\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Ken\n&gt; \n&gt; __________________________________\n&gt; Do you Yahoo!?\n&gt; Exclusive Video Premiere - Britney Spears\n&gt; http://launch.yahoo.com/promos/britneyspears/\n\n\n"
