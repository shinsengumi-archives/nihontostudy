The school was not supported by the local daimyo and they turned out mostly poor pieces, having said that there were a few makers who could produce better tsuba but nothing outstanding. The quality is way below that of even the average Waki-goto artists whose best work could rival that of the Goto main line.\nAlan\n \n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: John Berta \n  To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Sunday, April 16, 2006 8:29 PM\n  Subject: Re: [nihontostudy] Re: in defense of the ugly bird or seeking more &quot; punishment &quot;\n\n\n  Hi Milt;\n\n  I don&#39;t think so.  \n\n  They made some very good tsuba.  \n\n  I put their average work on  par with the Waki Goto average work.  \n\n  Now having said that, there were some very good swords made by the Bungo group also.  \n\n  John \n    ----- Original Message ----- \n    From: bungotakadasword \n    To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n    Sent: Sunday, April 16, 2006 12:14 PM\n    Subject: [nihontostudy] Re: in defense of the ugly bird or seeking more &quot; punishment &quot;\n\n\n    -t,\n    the Ko-kinko tsuba is in the Lundgren collection book and a scan is \n    available in my photo album on the list, Pete the dentist has a better \n    scan...........\n\n    got another question ..........\n    Is the Aizu Shoami school of soft metal tsuba the &quot; Bungo sword &quot; of \n    the tsuba world ?....like if one is not sure what it is then chances \n    are it&#39;s an Aizu  &quot; Shoamimono &quot; ??\n\n    Milt\n\n\n\n\n\n  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    YAHOO!
