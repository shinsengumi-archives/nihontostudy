Note\nthat I didn&#39;t get them quite the right size and that you see a little \nblue from the painters tape I use to hold\nall this stuff up, but still...)  These can be seen in menuki3_gobo and \nmenuki4_gobo  I suspect\nI could darken up the background and improve things more, but...\n\nI also tried this with another recent acquistion using the same \nnomenclature (see menuki1 & menuki2 in this\nsame directory).  Here you can see that the gold doesn&#39;t get as &quot;washed \nout&quot;.\n\nSo what do you guys think?  Which method looks better?\n\nIn case you&#39;re bored, you can also check out my other photo directories \nhere - the pointer to some recent pics of\nmy Yamato shizu katana  is:\n\nhttp://tinyurl.com/ot2c\n\nObviously I did this during the day and need some more background to \nhide material (and a stronger spotlight and...),\nbut still...\n\nAnd finally, I&#39;ve turned to the dark side and have a Canon 10D coming, \nso the camera that took those pics above\nis for sale (canon G2 with a pile of interesting accessories (filters, \nfilter adapters, yada yada) - contact me privately\nif interested (just thought I&#39;d ask before throwing it up on ebay...).\n\nP.S.  Like the sword holder?  if anybody has a line on some 2&quot; square \nnylon, delrin, or some sort of uhmw pe plastic\nrod that is black, I&#39;d love to hear about it...\n\n\n\n\n\n"
