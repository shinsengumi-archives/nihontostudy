I also remember someone explaining the little marks on the\nright side of Dr. Torigoye&#39;s kao signifying his evaluation of quality or\nvalue: one mark &quot;1st class,&quot; 2 marks &quot;2nd class.&quot;\n\nOf course hako-gaki, like origami, are still just an opinion. I had a tsuba\nwith a hako-gaki by Dr. Torigoye attributing it to Dai-go-ro, with his &quot;1st\nclass&quot; notation on the kao. I sold it to someone who found it in a book\nattributed to Akasaka, and the NBTHK gave it a paper as Akasaka.\n\nSo it goes.\n\nCraig\n\n\n\n-- \nCraig Harris\nBooks from and about Asia\nwww.bridgeofdreams.com\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
