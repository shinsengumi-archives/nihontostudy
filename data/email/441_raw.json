I find it necessary to keep a list of the titles I\n  own\n        (senility) to keep from ordering duplicates, and when I was entering\n  this\n        book on my list, I found no publisher, place, or date of publication\n      listed.\n\n        My impression is that the JSS/US was the publisher, is that correct?\n  Mr.\n        Robson refers to &quot;an auspicious day&quot; in 1997.  This just appeared, did\n  it\n        not?\n\n        What, by the way, is the Japanese for &quot;auspicious day?&quot;\n\n\n\n              Yahoo!
