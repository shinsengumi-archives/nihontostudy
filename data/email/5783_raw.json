So how much sori is too\nmuch??\n\nI mea=\r\nn it is quite pleasing to the eye, very appealing in fact but it sorta\nlook=\r\ns like a caricature of a sword.\n\nThe sori is tori-sori nice and even the le=\r\nngth of the blade, so in keeping\nwith that I went ahead and curved the naka=\r\ngo to match the sori in the blade\nto stay with the &quot;lines&quot; of the sword...\n=\r\n\nIt is in mid polish right now and once I get it mounted I will post some\np=\r\nics... I am amazed that the thing held together in the quench as it was\nmoa=\r\nning and groaning and dancing around while it was in the tank but I didn&#39;t\n=\r\nhear one &quot;Tink&quot; or &quot;Toink&quot; and no cracks are coming up and I am at 800\ngrit=\r\n on the polish (I don&#39;t use stones..I am doing this for book IV and am\nusin=\r\ng available abrasives that just about anyone can get...and I must say I am\n=\r\ngetting some really nice results on the blades I am making...)\n\nSo did I ma=\r\nke an abomination with 1 1 /2&quot; of sori???
