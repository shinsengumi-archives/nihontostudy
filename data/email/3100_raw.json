If the fuchi kashira really were Goto, they&#39;d probably be worth more than the estimates, but lots of black and gold Goto-esque kodogu of many levels of quality were produced.  Ojime are netsuke/inro-related, not Nihonto-related.   \n\n \n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: Kim Ghobrial \n  To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Friday, July 08, 2005 6:11 PM\n  Subject: Re: [nihontostudy] RE: Question....\n\n\n  Hey all,\n  I&#39;m not sure what is going on, but every time I send something or reply \n  to someone, I don&#39;t get any response from anyone.  I kind of feel like I \n  and my posts are invisible to everyone.  The other lists that I&#39;m on, I \n  get some type of response from someone, and I don&#39;t feel like I&#39;m \n  ignored.  If someone doesn&#39;t know, I would like to know this, if I need \n  to get Photos let me know, but don&#39;t ignore the questions.  There are a \n  lot of folks on this list which has expertise in parts of swords or full \n  swords and then there are folks, like myself which are learning from \n  asking questions and listening to the answers.  I don&#39;t have tons of \n  money for expensive books, what books I do have, do not cover areas \n  which I&#39;m asking questions about.  So, please, if someone asks a \n  question, please acknowledge it, even if it is an answer like, &quot;I don&#39;t \n  know the answer.&quot;\n\n  In the case of the question below, would it help in getting a photo of \n  the pieces and putting it up on this list for all of you to see?\n\n  Sincerely,\n  Kim\n\n  Kim Ghobrial wrote:\n\n  &gt;Hi Everyone,\n  &gt;Sorry to ask this, but I was looking at an Auction, which I&#39;m going to \n  &gt;see tomorrow and wanted to know if this is something for me to look at \n  &gt;or not.  Also, if it is okay, if the estimate of $120.00-180.00 is okay \n  &gt;for this piece.\n  &gt;\n  &gt;THREE JAPANESE COLLECTIBLES: two sword fittings, Fuchi-kashira \n  &gt;attributed to the Goto School having &quot;kiku&quot; and &quot;kiri&quot; motifs with gold \n  &gt;accents on black field, late Edo-early Meiji Period; together with \n  &gt;*ivory* carved ojime, inlaid, &quot;Fukuzuke&quot; (good luck) design, signed by \n  &gt;the carver, attributed to the Meiji Period.\n  &gt;\n  &gt;Kim\n  &gt;\n  &gt;\n  &gt; \n  &gt;Yahoo!
