It looks like a small tachi blade\nwhich I was told wasn&#39;t uncommon at the time?  \n\nWhile I am certainly not an expert on the subject\nseeing armour of the samurai and head gear etc, I\nwould assume these were meant at least in partial to\nintimidate an opponent.  I think a larger tsuba would\nfit into that concept.  Transmitting a message to the\nopponent that he is taking on a man of importance?  My\ngaigin guess.\n\nI asked this before, but what about the kogai/kozuka\nana being filled in? what purpose did this serve?  You\nhad a katana now its a wak size tsuba?  Purely\naesthetic?  Just to make sure you didn&#39;t stick you\nkogai/kozuka in the wrong hole?\n\nThanks for everyones input so far.\n\nKen\n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nThe New Yahoo!
