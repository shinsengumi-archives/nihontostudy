It was at a \nlocal antique shop for over a year before I picked it up for a very low price. \n It was hidden in an over packed display case from a dealer in other types of \noriental art.  The theme and work seems to match the works shown on Jinsoo&#39;s \nsite.  &lt;A HREF=&quot;http://nihontobook.homestead.com/files/kn/kaneiye.html&quot;&gt;http://nihontobook.homestead.com/files/kn/kaneiye.html&lt;/A&gt;\nThe rim is soft metal.  I assume this was put on due to damage to the iron.  \nDoes this decrease the value of the piece, and will it cause the piece to fail \nshinza?  \n\nLou\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
