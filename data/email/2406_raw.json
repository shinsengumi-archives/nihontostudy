You will know that at the sale prices went through the\n&gt; roof, but I am still not convinced that a number of the swords were\n&gt; correct. \n\nTwo of those I think the prices confirmed that most people thought were\nnot correct... there was a Kinju that seemed wrong to me, and that went\ncheap, then there was a Yukimitsu tanto that also seemed wrong to me and\nthat also went for cheap. The nakago just didn&#39;t look right on this\ntanto, and the workmanship in the blade was a bit pedestrian and not\nwhat one would expect for this smith... in my opinion. \n\nA couple others were like this to me as well... the Yukimitsu daito I\nhad qualms about, and the Chogi wakizashi. \n\nI&#39;m curious what your thoughts were about the other blades and which\nwere the five you&#39;d like to have taken home?\n\n- darcy\n\n\n"
