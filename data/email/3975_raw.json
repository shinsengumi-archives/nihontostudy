Looking at t=\r\nhe front of the guard it does appear to be Edo period and indeterminate sty=\r\nle.  I suspect that what you&#39;re seeing in the rim may be the structure of t=\r\nhe forge welding brought out by the rust.  It&#39;s not unusual to see pronounc=\r\ned layering in, for example, Akasaka guards that have been badly rusted.  S=\r\neeing a sharp ridge like that would be unusual for tekkotsu.  Also tekkotsu=\r\n are usually smoother, darker and more lustrous than the surrounding iron (=\r\nalthough not always so with Kanayama).\n&gt;\n&gt; I do however have a Kanayama tsu=\r\nba that I think is quite old that has a somewhat similar look in the rim.  =\r\nI&#39;ve never been able to decide how much of the appearance is due to how it =\r\nwas made vs. how it might have rusted.  Next time I set up to take macro ph=\r\notos I&#39;ll get some images of the rim for comparison.  The face of that guar=\r\nd also looks quite old and in Kanayama style, though.\n&gt;\n&gt; Jim\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   Hi =\r\nAlan, it may be a little pitted in the mimi but they are bones, and \n&gt;   to=\r\no big I think for edo, though not necessarily so I guess.\n&gt;\n&gt;   Cheer\n&gt;\n&gt;  =\r\n Rich\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   Alan Bale wrote:\n&gt;   &gt; It looks like Edo period Kyo-sukashi i=\r\nn poor shape with a pitted mimi.\n&gt;   &gt; Alan\n&gt;   &gt;&gt;\n&gt;   &gt;   Nice Jim, good w=\r\nork. These are excellent photo&#39;s and an invaluable help. \n&gt;   &gt;   If I may,=\r\n how would you classify this ?.\n&gt;   &gt;\n&gt;   &gt;   The condition is down a bit (=\r\n as are the photo&#39;s sorry ). I bought it as \n&gt;   &gt;   Muromachi Owari, then =\r\ngot it and thought it might be Kanayama. There is \n&gt;   &gt;   a long large ( r=\r\nope ) bone in the mimi, and quite a few smaller normal \n&gt;   &gt;   bumpy bones=\r\n. There are also small bones in the hira, running around the \n&gt;   &gt;   mimi.=\r\n I have not been able to pin the theme either, besides the ginger \n&gt;   &gt;   =\r\nleaves.\n&gt;   &gt;\n&gt;   &gt;   Any clues appreciated.\n&gt;   &gt;\n&gt;   &gt;   http://www.nihon=\r\ntomessageboard.com/personal/owari-hira.jpg\n&gt;   &gt;\n&gt;   &gt;   http://www.nihonto=\r\nmessageboard.com/personal/owari-mimi.jpg\n&gt;   &gt;\n&gt;   &gt;\n&gt;   &gt;   best wishes\n&gt; =\r\n  &gt;\n&gt;   &gt;   Rich\n&gt;\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n=\r\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt; Yahoo!
