Was there any particular reason why the older tsuba\nare smaller ? \n \nI have come up with 4 ideas\n \n1. Maybe the swords were shorter, so had a smaller tsuba ? (unlikely\nconsidering the Nambokucho monsters)\n \n2. People had smaller hands back then, therefore requiring a smaller\ntsuba ? (doubtful in my opinion)\n \n3. The swords were better balanced at that time, think Kamakura etc,\ntherefore required less tsuba for balance ? (this is my favorite at the\nmoment together with the last one)\n \n4. Since the swords were used on horseback with one arm, they had to be\nlight, ergo a small tsuba.\n \n- Matt\n \n \n\n-----Oorspronkelijk bericht-----\nVan: Arnold Frenzel [mailto:afrenzel@...] \nVerzonden: woensdag 9 juli 2003 23:32\nAan: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com\nOnderwerp: Re: [nihontostudy] tsuba value ?\n\n\nHi:\nWhat an interesting question! I think that as a general rule the notion\nof size and value, other things being equal, except in the restricted\nsituation of a daisho perfectly matched, but now separated pair, is\nreally\nnot an operational comparison. Tsuba size choices of the artisan were\ndetermined by the parameters of the blade and koshirae appropriate to\nthe\nperiod of initial manufacture. What make tsuba interesting and desirable\nis how close the fit is what it ought to be for the time of manufacture.\nIf one follows Sasano sensei, for example, with respect to the earliest\ntosho tsuba, the early ones were small and the later ones as a rule were\nlarger. Even though the designs might be quite similar, the criterion of\noriginality and probable scarcity ought to yield a significantly higher\nprice for the older but smaller piece. Mutatis mutandis the same\nargument\nholds for tsuba of different types and periods. How close the fit\nbetween\nthe piece at hand and the ideal type is probably the main determinant of\nvalue. For a short answer I do not believe that there is a correlation\nmerely between size and market value. My two cents worth anyway.  \n\nArnold Frenzel\nafrenzel@...\n\n\nOn Wed, 9 Jul 2003, Matthew E.
