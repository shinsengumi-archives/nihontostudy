Nice tsuba BTW.\n-t\nTom Helm\ntoryu@...\n&quot;Moriamur, et in media a=\r\nrma ruamus&quot;\n- Vergil\n\n\n\nOn Jul 22, 2011, at 11:39 AM, abale.vossnet.co.uk w=\r\nrote:\n\n&gt; Members of the list have rightly been sceptical of my find as it i=\r\ns  \n&gt; almost unheard of in the West, if I had not seen it myself I would  \n=\r\n&gt; not have believed it either. I have seen many swords with Muromachi/ \n&gt; M=\r\nomoyama style koshirae over the years, but 99.9% have been 19th c.  \n&gt; swor=\r\nds in retro style. Two exceptions come to mind: Victor Harris  \n&gt; and I cat=\r\nalogued the blades in the Museum of Japanese Sword Fittings  \n&gt; in Tokyo fo=\r\nr Christie=92s in =9105. In that collection was a Momoyama  \n&gt; tachi koshir=\r\nae that was later sold in NY, the other was an itomaki  \n&gt; tachi made for a=\r\nn Ikeda Daimyo in Christie=92s London. Victor has seen  \n&gt; this nagamaki an=\r\nd agrees that it is 16th c.\n&gt;\n&gt; I think this weapon is the first of a numbe=\r\nr of identical contract  \n&gt; pieces for an armoury, as it is numbered =911&#39; =\r\nas are one seppa, the  \n&gt; fuchi and the tsuka in ink under the fuchi, it is=\r\n utilitarian, with  \n&gt; thin yamagane mounts and low quality lacquer, the na=\r\nkago-ana are not  \n&gt; well made. The long ububa can be accounted for by its =\r\nlack of use,  \n&gt; it may have been polished only once or twice then stored f=\r\nor a very  \n&gt; long time, this would account for its fairly good condition a=\r\npart  \n&gt; from the leather tsuka binding shrinking and being attacked by  \n&gt;=\r\n insects.\n&gt;\n&gt; It may look like a sword but it has the thick saya of a polea=\r\nrm, no  \n&gt; kurikata and the tsuka is 21.5&quot; long.\n&gt;\n&gt; As I stated in my earl=\r\nier post it weighs around 6lbs, this is not  \n&gt; something one would want as=\r\n a personal weapon, it is too heavy and  \n&gt; awkward to carry and I think wo=\r\nuld only be useful in battle.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --\n&gt; I am using the free version of S=\r\nPAMfighter.\n&gt; We are a community of 7 million users fighting spam.\n&gt; SPAMfi=\r\nghter has removed 9 of my spam emails to date.\n&gt; Get the free SPAMfighter h=\r\nere: http://www.spamfighter.com/len\n&gt;\n&gt; The Professional version does not h=\r\nave this message\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed=\r\n]\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
