In practice this\nis not always possible but I do try......  However I think you will find\nthat most of these prices are still lower than what is common on the\nnet. Try Satcho, Jinsoo or Mr. Weissberg for example. That being said\noffers are always considered, I am pretty difficult to insult as far as\nthat goes. \n \nI can let the book you want go for $85 including wordwide shipping. That\nworks out at the same as the ebay one if you add on the shipping to\nthat. And ofcourse since I am in the Netherlands your weak dollar is not\nhelping much either :-)\n \n- Matt\n \n\n\n    Z Recruiting Services\n    &quot;Zurich Toren&quot; Muzenstraat 89\n    2511 WB Den Haag\n    T: +31 70 4262273\n    F: +31 70 4262111\n    W: zrecruiting.com\n    E: info@...\n    Kijk ook op monsterboard.nl, jobbingmall.nl en \n    nationalevacaturebank.nl voor actuele vacatures!\n\n\n-----Oorspronkelijk bericht-----\nVan: Craig Harris [mailto:benkei@...] \nVerzonden: donderdag 1 januari 2004 22:35\nAan: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com\nOnderwerp: RE: [nihontostudy] Crass Commercial Message, books and sword\nfor sale.\n\n\nMatt,\n\nI would want your #11, I&#39;ve been looking for it for some time, but your\nprices! Enough to make a predatory bookseller blush! Even the last copy\nMike\nY. (historian333) sold on eBay only went for $70 or so. (I missed seeing\nthe\nauction until it was over.)\n\nAs someone who, as of today, officially will be making my living selling\nbooks, I am comforted by your prices - I have many of the same titles -\nand\ndo hope you get them, it bodes well for my business if you do.\n\nLet me know if there is something we can work out, even a trade for\nsomething you are looking for ...\n\nCraig L.
