My blade was given a pink slip \nwithout any comment a=\r\nbout it at all. As I stated earlier, Inami \nHakusui papered it to Shinto Su=\r\nkesada. I have it from reliable \nsources that only Koto smiths used Bizen K=\r\nuni Ju Osafune -. This \nprefix is Sue-Bizen. Shinto Bizen used Bizen Osafun=\r\ne Ju -. Anyway, I \nwas disappointed that the only explanation given was tha=\r\nt they would \nnot Shinsa it due to the &#39;temper line&#39; running off in the kis=\r\nsaki. \nOh well, I will bring it to next years SF Token Kai and get all \nsor=\r\nts of opinions.\n\nElliott \n\n\n\n--- In nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com, paul bowm=\r\nan &lt;bowman1955@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Dont agree Rich, If a novice (or indeed any=\r\none else)  submits \nsomething they have no clue about I think it would be u=\r\nseful at \nleast to be told what the tsuba/ sword etc was trying to be. usin=\r\ng a \ncatch-all Bungo-Takada, echizen seki, or shiomi attribution does \nlitt=\r\nle to advance their knowledge. At least if they were told what \nit was copy=\r\ning they could look at originals and see the differences.\n&gt;   Also I am not=\r\n sure (though I have never had to do it) why \nsaying &quot;Kyo-kinko in the styl=\r\ne of&quot; need necessarily take much more \ntime. I would assume the panel would=\r\n know what the artist was trying \nto emulate to be able to dismiss it as a =\r\ncopy. \n&gt;   Sorry if this is too simplistic, Im the same with software, I \na=\r\nlways think problems are easy to solve but then I dont have to do \nit!!\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; Richard Turner &lt;ikkanshi@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;           I cannot see how it woul=\r\nd help in studies ?
