Early Soshu work like Yukimitsu and Kunimitsu show it very well.  I also find them to be the most impressive blades.  The blue color is a different thing from the &quot;wet.&quot;\n\nYears ago I had a major house flood while away on vacation.  Some swords were affected, but only a mediocre shinto blade rusted.  The koto under the same conditions were not damaged at all, although the shirasaya were stained and had to be reglued.  Just a koto/shinto anecdote.\n\nJim\n\n\n\nThis is a stumper for me. I&#39;ve had a great Yukimitsu in my hands, and\ntwo great Shintogo Kunimitsu, and the overall feeling was this kind of\ngrey/white. The color seemed very pure, and these Shintogo were very\ngood and very healthy and the most perfect Nihonto that I&#39;ve seen.\n\nMy feeling at the time (and now) was that it was the kind of thing I\nwould expect to be carried by an angel.\n\nPut side by side with one that seemed filled with various blue colors,\nit was hard to tell the difference.\n\nI wonder if anyone has tried to do some spectral analysis.\n\nSometimes color can be some kind of low-grade oxidation.\n\n- darcy\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
