Thinner lighter tsuba were used for one handed sword action as the use of the sword was generally mounted ( from the horse ), later on in the The Muromachi, the action moved two the ground and became two handed ( both hands were free ) the sword didn&#39;t need to be as light and the tsuba became heavier to cope with the balance required for two handed use.\n\nThis is at least how I recall it, I stand corrected and look for guidence if I am off the mark, especially with the periods I quoted, I&#39;m trying this from memory.\n\nRich T\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: Matthew E. Hoyle \n  To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Wednesday, April 23, 2003 12:24 PM\n  Subject: RE: [nihontostudy] EXCELLENT!!! and startin&#39; off with a question...\n\n\n  What about the use of the tsuba for balancing the sword ? Doesn&#39;t that\n  play an important role as well ?\n\n  I read in a piece by R. B. Caldwell that since the kamakura tachis were\n  so well balanced by themselves (he described them as prima donnas haha) \n\n  they really only needed a light lacquered leather guard. \n\n  So it stands to reason that the Nambokucho massive swords that had\n  little fumbari were no where near as well balanced and must have needed\n  massive tsuba to match ??\n\n  Or small ones that were 2.5 inches wide and 1 inch thick of course\n  hahaha\n\n  - Matt \n\n  -----Oorspronkelijk bericht-----\n  Van: Richard Turner [mailto:ikkanshi@...] \n  Verzonden: donderdag 24 april 2003 6:16\n  Aan: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com\n  Onderwerp: Re: [nihontostudy] EXCELLENT!!! and startin&#39; off with a\n  question...\n\n\n  This is an interesting topic, I have just been lent The Picture Book of\n  Old Tsuba by Robert Burawoy to read and enjoy and there are several of\n  these \n  very tsuba in this book. I remember reading that the tsuba size changed\n  when fighting went from one handed mounted to two handed ground\n  fighting. There are several nice smaller cast pieces in this book that\n  are from the nambokucho period. There is also a very nice red lacquer\n  that was a used by certain Priests I believe that loos spectacular. I\n  will research this more later in the day and respond with proper\n  information.\n\n  cheers\n\n  Rich Turner\n\n\n  ---\n  Outgoing mail is certified Virus Free.\n  Checked by AVG anti-virus system (http://www.grisoft.com).\n  Version: 6.0.471 / Virus Database: 269 - Release Date: 10/04/2003\n\n\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n  Yahoo!
