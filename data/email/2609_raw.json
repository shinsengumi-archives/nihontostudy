I don&#39;t recall just who all became involved in our on-line discussion of &quot;utori&quot; but I for one, plan on bringing along a few examples of what &quot;I&quot; call utori and also a few examples of what I have my doubts about being &quot;true&quot; utori technique. Keep this in mind and if we can gather a few of us together for a short while that weekend, maybe with Jim&#39;s leadership we could all learn something about &quot;utori&quot; work. I will have a table to sit down at or if not there, certainly a quiet corner can be found somewhere there. I for one look forward to some discussion on this topic!\n\nRon\nSTL\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
