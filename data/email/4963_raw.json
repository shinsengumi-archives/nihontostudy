Soon after I sent out this question it dawned on me that by Meiji 4 the Tokugawa were no longer in power and therefore, a meaningful connection between this sword and the Tokugawa would be unlikely. But I&#39;m glad I asked since this did bring about some on-line discussion. \n\nInterestingly, this sword which was owned for years by a good friend and eventually came to me last year, looks and feels much like a gendaito which I guess, it really is when you think about it. It is a very stoutly build and very masculine blade although made relatively short in length (63.7 cm). My other nidai Naokatsu which is dated 1865 is more a Nambokucho copy, measuring 77.9 cm with O-gissaki. I find it interesting to see the comparison in so few years but at a time of great &quot;change&quot; in Japan. It does surprise me that Naokatsu still had a patron at this time of change in power. \n\nRon\nSTL\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
