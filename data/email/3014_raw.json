We&#39;ve have a few good auctions\nand some really neat Japanese sword related items. I would like to\nmake a one time announcement on the following.\n\nI&#39;ve just created some sponsor links at NihontoAuctions.com. The\neventual idea is to provide the space for these links at a nominal fee\nof around $2.00 per week. With a web interface that potential\nadvertisers can use to purchase advertising space. Since I don&#39;t have\nthat setup yet, I&#39;ve had to manually create the links. You&#39;ll notice\nthat is looks a lot like Google AdWords :-) But unlike AdWords, it&#39;s\ncomparatively cheap.\n\nWhat you see now are links created for people that are providing\nNihontoAuctions.com with a link on their website. I&#39;m sorry if I\nforgot anyone, please contact me privately and I&#39;ll add you.\n\nOnce I get the ad purchasing webpage complete, I will create a LINKS\npage and move these links to that page. For now, and until I get the\npurchasing webpage complete, I&#39;m offering free link/ad space for those\ninterested. It&#39;s a first come first served sort of thing since I have\nlimited space. Please contact me privately if you are interested.\n\nAgain, I will create a links page in which I will place free of charge\nanyones link that links NihontoAuctions.com. HOWEVER, for those\ninterested in front page advertising space, the cost will be around $2\na week once I get the purchasing webpage complete. (Approx 1 month).\n\nI hope this is fair. I&#39;m not doing this to get rich, but to pay server\nfees so I can continue to provide this service.\n\nThanks for the band-width,\nDeron\n\nhttp://www.nihontoauctions.com\n\n\n\n"
