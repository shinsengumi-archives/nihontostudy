I too have noted that the technique we call\nnunome turns up in lots of premodern metal working traditions. In addition\nto those noted, I have seen it on Tibetan and &quot;Chinese&quot; stuff, most notably\nin our area of interest on Chinese &quot;Namban&quot; tsuba, for example. The\nexplicit item that triggered my question is an iron six-sided vase I have\nwith heavy (but not very attractive) silver overlay that I think is Korean.\nDoes anyone know the Korean word for such stuff, by the way?\n      I have also noted that the earliest apparent occurrences of this\ntechnique on Japanese stuff all seem to have a Muromachi sort of age. Given\nits apparent world-wide distribution of the technique, it must have either\nbeen introduced or invented in Japan at that time, OR, older stuff has not\nsurvived. I tend to favor the later idea.\n      It is possible, I betcha, that the fine iron striations that hold the\ngold/silver on, simply won&#39;t survive more than about 500 years. If they\nlargely oxidize away in that kind of time frame, all older examples would\nbe gone so it would look like nunome suddenly appeared.\n      Let me add, in closing, that virtually all of the techniques Japanese\nkinko use do show up in other parts of the world and other artistic\ntraditions. The Japanese like to see themselves as innovators in this\nregard, but what they really did, IMHO, is bring basic techniques to high\nlevels of virtuosity. This weekend I bought a couple of swords. One is a\nrather ordinary nippon-to, but the other a really nice cuphilt (Spanish?)\nrapier that is embellished with light repousse, good horidashi engraving,\nand a wonderfully even &quot;nanako-ishime&quot; finish that is as nice as any on an\niron tsuba. Craftsmanship is where we find it, mebbe.\n\nPeter Bleed\nAssociate Dean\nCollege of Arts and Sciences\n1223 Oldfather Hall\nUniversity of Nebraska\nLincoln, NE 68588-0312\n(402) 472-2891\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
