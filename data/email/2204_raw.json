I have also heard tell of great tsubas \nthat were made too glossy my over zealous cloth rubbers.  As you \nsay, leave well enough alone and err on the side of caution.\nIf the tsuba is un-certified and you are unsure as to the \nauthenticity of its patina, I beleive that dunking it in boiling \nwater cannot harm it and may remove grime and wax at least.  Please \nuse only plain water for this and make sure the piece is dry ASAP \nonce it is removed.  What you may get from this process will be a \nUGLY lookin tsuba since any false patina will be stripped and red \nrust, pits, etc will be exposed.  While you might be saying to \nyourself, &quot;It looked better before&quot; you now can start from ground \nzero and nurse it back to health.\n\nHope this helps\nKirk\n\n--- In nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com, &quot;steven&quot; &lt;steven_88_2000@y...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; Hi Richard,\n&gt; \n&gt; Thank you for your excellent words of wisdom.  I think the \n&gt; message I&#39;m getting is:  just leave well enough alone!  So I \n&gt; believe I will...  :o).  \n&gt; One thing, though:  for rookies like me, how would you suggest \n&gt; being able to spot the oiled, waxed, or (gulp) painted tsuba that \n&gt; may deceive me?  I certainly hear what you&#39;re saying, and want \n&gt; to heed your words.  But how, exactly, can I know it when I see \nit?  \n&gt; I don&#39;t believe any of the pieces I&#39;ve acquired thus far have been \n&gt; tampered with this way, but I guess I can&#39;t really be sure (I have \n&gt; not attempted any soap and water cleaning of them.  They \n&gt; appear in great condition to my untrained eye, and so I haven&#39;t \n&gt; felt any need to clean...).  Most of my pieces have Hozon papers: \n&gt; would this be any indication at all that the tsuba in question are \n&gt; more likely to be &quot;deception-free&quot;?  Or is that entirely \nirrelevant?  \n&gt; Sorry for all the bothersome questions, but I really am eager to \n&gt; become informed!  Many thanks, Richard, for your time and \n&gt; attention...\n&gt; \n&gt; Steve\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com, Richard George &lt;\n&gt; rkg@t...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; steven,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; first,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; DON&quot;T MESS WITH THE RUST INSIDE THE SUKASHI \n&gt; CUTOUTS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Now that I&#39;ve said that...\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve seen all sorts of tsuba abuse (&quot;brown&quot; wax, various \n&gt; attempts at \n&gt; &gt; repatination, people who have\n&gt; &gt; decided they can do a better job of patination than the original \n&gt; maker \n&gt; &gt; and strip top quality\n&gt; &gt; pieces down and start over, people who just wax them with \n&gt; some magic \n&gt; &gt; compound, oil them, etc.,.) - don&#39;t do it -\n&gt; &gt; basically, Jinsoo is absolutely correct - if the surface patina \nis \n&gt; good, \n&gt; &gt; just store &#39;em somewhere where they\n&gt; &gt; won&#39;t get condensed on and rub them periodically with your \n&gt; hands/a soft \n&gt; &gt; cloth.  If its got problems, see below...\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; the deadly enemy of iron tsuba is red rust - if your piece has \n&gt; this on \n&gt; &gt; it, its a problem.  somehow you have to\n&gt; &gt; get this off - some people use horn, but I&#39;ve found that ivory \n&gt; seems to \n&gt; &gt; be really good for use to scrape this off\n&gt; &gt; while not harming the the brown rust (I think Jim Gilbert has an \n&gt; &gt; excellent article on this in a couple of\n&gt; &gt; places on line...).  - often you have to work at it quite a bit -\n I \n&gt; &gt; sometimes alternate scraping sessions with\n&gt; &gt; washing the piece in warm water with a mild soap and a soft \n&gt; &gt; toothbrush...  And again, you only want to\n&gt; &gt; do this ONLY on the outside surfaces of the tsuba, not down in \n&gt; the sukashi.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; After you&#39;ve done that, the revealed old rust regions are often \n&gt; pretty \n&gt; &gt; gnarly, or if the piece is just plain &quot;rough&quot;,\n&gt; &gt; you can &quot;pocket polish&quot; the piece - just carry it around\n&gt; &gt; in your pocket for a few weeks (NOT where you carry your keys/\n&gt; change) - \n&gt; &gt; this gives the piece a nice rubbed look that\n&gt; &gt; is hard to get by just marathon rubbing sessions with a cloth...\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; When you&#39;re buying tsuba, always be on the lookout for pieces \n&gt; that have \n&gt; &gt; been &quot;primped&quot; like this - you&#39;ll see\n&gt; &gt; people that hide a multitude of sins with various waxes, oils, \n&gt; PAINT (I \n&gt; &gt; got a couple like this - the guy color\n&gt; &gt; matched the patina and jammed the tsuba (!!) - looked real \n&gt; darned good, \n&gt; &gt; too - I was quite happy until I tried to clean\n&gt; &gt; up a rough spot I thought was oil, used some enamel thinner, \n&gt; and - \n&gt; &gt; surprise!...), etc.,.  I&#39;d like to think they\n&gt; &gt; just wanted the pieces to look better/didn&#39;t know any better and \n&gt; really \n&gt; &gt; weren&#39;t thinking fraudulent thoughts, but....\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Good Luck,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; rkg\n&gt; &gt; (Richard George)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;Milt,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Jinsoo Kim told me that the best way to care for the old iron \n&gt; &gt; &gt;sukashi pieces I have is to simply rub them now and then \n&gt; with a soft \n&gt; &gt; &gt;silk cloth.  I have read the various prescriptions for \ncleaning, \n&gt; &gt; &gt;waxing, etc... and, as I&#39;ve mentioned, I am quite the novice \n&gt; and so \n&gt; &gt; &gt;am in the dark as to what the current thinking on this is.  The \n&gt; &gt; &gt;tsuba I have are all in excellent condition, with only minimal \n&gt; spots \n&gt; &gt; &gt;of light surface rust in some of the sukashi openings, and \n&gt; none on \n&gt; &gt; &gt;the plate or rim.  Again, I appreciate your thoughts on this, \n&gt; and am \n&gt; &gt; &gt;gradually coming to a view that if I&#39;m in doubt, do nothing!  \n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Thanks again,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Steve\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;Yahoo!
