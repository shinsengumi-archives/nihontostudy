As an art conservator (though generally art on paper, not metals) I&#39;m able to give a\nlittle bit of professional info on this one. \nIn the museum world, the general method for labeling objects is to first put down a coat, acting\nas a barrier layer, of some sort of clear polymer. Nowadays it is usually a non-yellowing product\ncalled paraloid B-72 which is soluble in toluene and/or xylene.  Sometimes, clear nail polish is\nused which is soluble in acetone.  The ID# is then painted on this, and a second coat of the\npolymer is used to make everything stay put.\nI suppose some private collectors wouldn&#39;t hesitate to just use something like white-out or\nliquid-paper for numbering.  This will chip off easily.  In instances where things are more\ndifficult, and you risk scratching the delicate metal surface, try a q-tip swab with a little of\nthe above mentioned solvents and it should do the trick.\n\nRegards,\nDoug Sanders\n\n--- Richard Turner &lt;ikkanshi@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; cheers Jim, a bit of ivory/bone would do then I guess.\n&gt; \n&gt; all the best\n&gt; \n&gt; Rich\n&gt;   ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt;   From: Jim Gilbert \n&gt;   To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n&gt;   Sent: Wednesday, August 20, 2003 11:25 AM\n&gt;   Subject: Re: [nihontostudy] Re: tsuba school\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   Rich,\n&gt;   They&#39;re usually some sort of paint.  They tend to be brittle enough to flake off safely with a\n&gt; sharp tool that&#39;s not hard enough to scratch the patina.  I don&#39;t see any reason to keep them\n&gt; unless you want to maintain a visible connection with the collection of whoever originally\n&gt; painted the numbers on.\n&gt; \n&gt;   Jim\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;     Hi Jim, Rich et all, thanks for the concessus, Shï¿½ami it is then. \n&gt;     what is the overall opinion of the catalogue numbers on the back, \n&gt;     personally, I would like to see them gone as they are of little use \n&gt;     to me but I am reluctant to touch them, are they generally paint, \n&gt;     crayon ? or what and is there are safe way to remove them or should I \n&gt;     just leave them be.\n&gt; \n&gt;     cheers\n&gt; \n&gt;     Rich\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;         Yahoo!
