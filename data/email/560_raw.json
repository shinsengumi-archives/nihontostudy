Later on=\r\nes tend to be thinner.  The early Akasaka really favored a very &quot;high,&quot; rou=\r\nnded rim compared with other groups working at the same time.\n\nSometimes te=\r\nkkotsu are seen in early examples.  Senkotsu is more common, which is a sor=\r\nt of long linear bone that forms where the inner and outer plates are joine=\r\nd.  \n\nI&#39;m not sure if you intended there to be an attached photo.  The list=\r\n doesn&#39;t permit attachments, but you can post images in the group photo alb=\r\num at:\nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/nihontostudy/\n\nLog in and click on the=\r\n &quot;Photos&quot; link at the left.  I can provide detailed instructions for anyone=\r\n who would like to learn how to post photos. It&#39;s quite easy.\n\nJim \n\n\n\n  De=\r\nar All,\n  I have been discussing the tsuba below with a number of friends f=\r\nrom both this and another group. The concensus to date is that this is earl=\r\ny Akasaka. While I am more than content with that attribution I was wonderi=\r\nng how common the thick round mimi was in Aakasaka work? Also there are a l=\r\not of bones in the mimi. I understand that early Akasaka work was influence=\r\nd by Owari tsuba, is this an example of this? or should I be looking in ano=\r\nther direction.\n  All comments greatly appreciated.\n\n\n\n  ------------------=\r\n---------------\n  Want to chat instantly with your online friends?
