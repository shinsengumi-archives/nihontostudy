For years, I&#39;ve found these Mino tsuba rather interesting and have accumulated a group of them of various qualities. My thinking was to put together an article comparing them to one another but I wouldn&#39;t hold my breath waiting for it! There is a small-ish book titled &quot;Mino-bori&quot; (I think thats the title) that shows a lot of the Mino work and dates the works. What I&#39;ve always felt the book shows is how (almost?) &quot;mass produced&quot; so much of this work was. Interesting little book. Yamanaka translated it for me years ago. (It seems I gave that translation to somebody for editing and eventual publication, but if so, I don&#39;t recall who that was!) A lot of the brief text is pretty easy to understand, however. While not all such work can be called &quot;excellent&quot; I still find it interesting to study.\n\nRon\nSTL\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: Matthew E.

Could someone perhaps do a photo comparison for the list between\n  genuine (16th century?) Mino goto stuff and later rubbish copies? I\n  think that would be extremely educational.

For real, high quality Mino (or Goto)\n  tsuba the color of the shakudo is pure black without a trace of brown.\n  The carving is very crisp and precise, the nanako perfectly formed and\n  the gold thick with rich color.  Putting a good one next to a lesser one\n  makes the difference much more clear than I can hope to describe.  I\n  borrowed two tsuba to do that at the SF show with a few people when we\n  were talking about exactly this topic.\n\n  Seeing this one in person would help of course, but I think it falls\n  short.  The somewhat sloppy carving of the insects and plants looks like\n  shiiremono work.  I agree that it is much better than the worst of the\n  so-called Nagoya-mono.  That said, I have seen a few pieces of this type\n  that I didn&#39;t think were too hot, but got Hozon level attribution to\n  later Mino.  I suppose that there is overlap between the better\n  Mino-style production work and lesser &quot;genuine&quot; Mino.  There is a chance\n  that Milt&#39;s piece could paper as later Mino (even without free drinks)\n  if it&#39;s better than the photo suggests.  I don&#39;t think that it is\n  representative of high quality Mino work though.\n\n  Does that make any sense?\n\n  Jim\n\n    Jim -\n\n    Why do you call this shiiremono? The quality looks a lot\n    better than what I&#39;ve seen of this shiiremono genre?\n    What details of the tsuba say it&#39;s shiiremono?\n\n    Rich S\n\n\n\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n    _____  \n\n  Yahoo!
