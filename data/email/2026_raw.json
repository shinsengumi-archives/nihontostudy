I&#39;m not having much luck, so may beg\nJim&#39;s help later.\n\nI looked at your tsuba and thought Bushu Ito. I wanted\nto see if I could find similar example in some of the\nbooks I had out. It has some of that richness of 3-D\ncarving(?) that always makes me wonder &#39;Umetada&#39;.\n\nBut this one looks so clean and the metal so dark &\nsmooth with no gold loss, and a large seppa dai. No\nchance its modern or at least post-Edo? Very clean\npiece.\n   \nCurran\n\n\n\n\n--- Jim Gilbert &lt;jggilbert@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Rich,\n&gt; Probably Bushu Ito, but could also be Choshu.\n&gt; \n&gt; Jim\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   All, anyone got an idea of a school for this tsuba\n&gt; ?.
