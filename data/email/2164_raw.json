One is a pair of 17th-century\nJapanese six-panel screens that depict the Portuguese on their ships\nas they are approaching Japan. The Japanese found the foreigners\nstrange; they are depicted with red hair, bulging eyes and huge\nnoses. This cross-cultural art, known as Namban in Japan, is always\nworth a look, if only to see how Westerners were viewed when first\nencountered.\n\nChristie&#39;s is also selling an entire set of Noh theater masks and\nrobes from an Edo-period (1615-1868) collection. They belonged to a\nlord from Yamanouchi Province. Any would-be producers could pick up\nenough masks and costumes at this sale to supply an entire Noh\ntroupe.\n\nMany galleries plan exhibitions to coincide with the auctions, and\nthe most astonishing show of Japanese work may be the elaborate\nJapanese sword fittings at Sebastian Izzard Asian Fine Art, at 17\nEast 76th Street in Manhattan, from Tuesday through Sept. 30. The\nprotectors are beaten, patinated, lacquered and adorned with golden\nfigures from famous Japanese war stories. The workmanship makes\nFaberg� look almost amateur.\n\nThe sword fittings are from the collection of Alexander G. Mosl�, a\nGerman businessman who worked in Japan from 1884 to 1907. As the\nrepresentative of the Gruson Company, a subsidiary of Krupp Steel,\nMosl� was able to persuade the Japanese government to switch from\nFrench to German arms just as Japan was asserting itself as a\nmilitary power. (The first Sino-Japanese War was in 1894-95 and the\nRusso-Japanese War in 1904-05.)\n\nThe arms trade made Mosl� wealthy; at one point he had 2,249\nJapanese swords, armor, more than 1,600 sword fittings, Japanese\npaintings, prints, sculptures, ceramics, lacquer and textiles. Mosl�\nretired in 1907 and returned to Germany, working with scholars and\ndealers to learn more about his collection. In 1909 he exhibited it\nat the K�nigliches Kunstgewerbe Museum in Berlin. It was published\nin two catalogs in 1914, which are still considered important\nreference works.\n\nIn the late 1920&#39;s, Mosl� traveled to the United States to try to\nsell his collection to public institutions. He did sell some prints\nto the Art Institute of Chicago and some lacquers to the Freer\nGallery of Art in Washington, but, apparently, little more. He was\nin the United States in 1941, when America went to war, and was\nstranded here. Sometime before his death in 1949, he entered a\nmental institution.\n\nHis bank organized a sale of his Japanese works at Parke-Bernet in\nNew York in 1948, including the fittings in this sale. These 170\nworks have been in private hands since that earlier sale. They\ninclude simple designs made of iron and ceremonial sets embellished\nwith gold, silver and copper. They range in price from a few\nthousand to a few hundred thousand dollars apiece.\n\nIt is not easy for Americans to appreciate the importance of swords\nin pre-20th-century Japan. Beginning in feudal times, Japanese\nwarlords equipped their armies with razor-sharp swords and fancy\nsword fittings.\n\n&quot;During the Edo period, a time of peace, swords were worn as status\nsymbols,&quot; said Mr. Izzard, who was the head of the Japanese and\nKorean art department at Christie&#39;s from 1980 to 1997. &quot;Craft\nschools specializing in sword fittings emerged, each with its own\ntraditions and styles.&quot;\n\nSamurai wore their swords in public, a symbol of class and honor. A\nsamurai might choose quiet, subdued fittings to wear at a high\ngovernmental occasion or something more flamboyant for a more casual\nevent, much as women wear their jewels today. In 1876 the emperor\nMeiji banned the wearing of swords in public as part of his\nmodernization campaign.\n\n&quot;What were once wearable symbols of wealth, prestige or entitlement\nbecame relics that illustrated 600 years of designs by some of the\nworld&#39;s finest metalworkers,&quot; Mr. Izzard said. &quot;Collecting swords\nand their fittings quickly became popular in Japan and the West. Mosl\n�&#39;s tenure in Japan coincided with the wave of interest in Japanese\nart among Westerners, who were intrigued by the recently opened\ncountry and its culture.&quot;\n\nJaponisme swept over Europe and America, influencing artists,\nfurniture and textile designers and metalworkers. Mr. Mosl� was in\nthe right place at the right time. The Metropolitan Museum of Art,\nthe Brooklyn Museum and the Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum all\nhave Japanese metalwork in their collections, some from the same\nperiod.\n\nMany of Mr. Izzard&#39;s sword fittings come in beautifully lacquered\nboxes that may have been commissioned by Mr. Mosl�; they are works\nof art in themselves. Sword fittings are ardently collected by\nconnoisseurs of Japanese art, so it is worth seeing Mr. Mosl�&#39;s\ncollection before it is dispersed.\n\nDoyle New York will not have its Chinese porcelain auction until\nOct. 27, but from Monday through next Friday the auction house is\nscheduling previews by appointment for 60 lots of Chinese blue and\nwhite porcelain from the Kangxi period (1662-1722) from the Ralph\nSpencer Collection. (Information: Andrea Blunck Frost, Doyle&#39;s Asian\nart expert, 212-427-4141.)\n\nMr. Spencer assembled his collection in the 1960&#39;s and 70&#39;s on trips\nto London and at prominent Manhattan galleries like Chait. He was a\ncontemporary, and collecting rival, of\n\nF. Gordon Morrill, whose Chinese porcelain collection Doyle sold\nlast September for $12 million. (Morrill&#39;s rare Yuan dynasty pilgrim\nflask, circa 1345, sold for $5.8 million, a world auction record for\na piece of Chinese porcelain.)\n\nThe Spencer Collection, which is later in date, is expected to earn\nabout $300,000.\n\nPhiladelphia Curator\n\nAnne d&#39;Harnoncourt, the director of the Philadelphia Museum of Art,\nhas announced the appointment of David L. Barquist as curator of\nAmerican decorative arts, beginning in January. Mr. Barquist has\nbeen acting curator of American decorative arts at the Yale\nUniversity Art Gallery, where he began his career as an intern in\n1981.\n\nAn authority on American silver, Mr. Barquist is the author of &quot;Myer\nMyers: Jewish Silversmith in Colonial New York&quot; and &quot;American and\nEnglish Pewter at the Yale University Art Gallery.&quot;\n\n&quot;The Philadelphia collections are extraordinary, but the museum is\nregionally focused,&quot; Mr. Barquist said in an interview. &quot;In trying\nto present the story of American decorative arts, there are a few\nholes one would try to fill judiciously. We need a few carefully\nchosen examples of works from places like Boston to play off of the\nmuseum&#39;s collections.&quot;\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2004/09/17/arts/design/17ANTI.html\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n---\nSamurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\nSamurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n---\nYahoo!
