It is indeed in shirasaya, and also has Tanobe\nsensei&#39;s sayagaki on it. \n\nYou hit on a lot of items why it is a collectable piece. There are a lot\nof activities in the hamon too, making it a good study sword, and of\ncourse it is also representative of its times. \n\nThe horimono are not etched as was previously suggested by the question\nasker. Horimono like this are carved. Naotsuna are often found with\nbohi, but horimono like this are quite rare on his works, and there are\nvery few tanto by this smith (none are signed).\n\nThere are three mekugi ana most likely on this tanto because it has gone\ninto three different sets of fittings (or more) over its lifetime. That,\nand the frequent polishing, would likely point to this as being a well\nused weapon, rather than something that spent most of its life as an\nobject of adoration. Those are my guesses at it.\n\nFor the original poster, in terms of the high end Soshu smiths, this\nrepresents entry-level price, so the question is more one of what is\nholding this one back from higher prices I would think. The hamon is\nstill lively on this tanto, but it is at the point where I wouldn&#39;t want\nto put one, or two more polishes on it. That is pretty much the only\nthing against it in my book, but then there are others who have\ndifferent tastes in school, smith, period, and type.\n\n- darcy\n\n&lt;ashigaru1@...&gt; writes:\n\n&gt; While described as being slightly &quot;tired&quot; this tanto has much going \n&gt; for it.  Soshu style -- not all that common; ubu; student \n&gt; [atribution, school of] of not only a good smith, but a student of \n&gt; Masamune -- considered the O-Kaji -- if i can make up a word -- the \n&gt; master of master smiths.  His work is almost never signed, and it is \n&gt; not surpising his student&#39;s swords were not either.  He worked for \n&gt; the Shogun of the Kamakera Bankafu thus would not usually sign his \n&gt; name as a relatively indendent smith might. It has good paper. In \n&gt; good polish.  And since they do not say, I assume it is delivered in \n&gt; shirasaya.  Being a newcomer to Nihon-to myself, that is about all I \n&gt; got.  I am sure the more Knowledgable members can expand upon, or \n&gt; correct, my comments.\n\n&gt; One question for the group:  Why the three mekugie ana?  \n\n&gt; Doug\n\n\n\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; nihontostudy-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n\n \n\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
