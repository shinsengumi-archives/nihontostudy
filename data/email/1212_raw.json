The so-called Shingen guards are wire wrapped, sometimes so heavily that none of the underlying sukashi tsuba is visible.  Others, like the one Peter posted, will have some of the guard covered with a brass plate and/or fukurin.  I&#39;m not aware of another term for this type of tsuba other than Shingen.  However, there&#39;s no evidence that this style of tsuba had anything to do with Takeda Shingen, and if anything probably dates from the Bakumatsu period or later.\n\nRich, since you now have the 2nd ed. of Tsuba Kanshoki, flip to the end of the book to find a section titled &quot;I will show here some poor samples as follows lest you should get such ones.&quot;  The bottom of page 387 shows one of the full wrap &quot;Shingen&quot; tsuba and p. 389 has a mukade example.  A lot of the old European collections had big, heavily wrapped Shingen tsuba.  Whoever was making them seems to have created a market.\n\nJim\n\n\n\n  Hi Rich;\n\n  Offhand Shingen is the only one that comes to mind.  This one seems a bit unusual, as they mostly covered the whole sukashi plate in wire.  Some of the tsuba they used were very good sukashi tsuba.\n\n  John\n    \n\n\n    cheers John, I have seen them with the usual rail/nail type of pattern but not like this, was wire used as a decoration often ?.\n\n    Rich\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
