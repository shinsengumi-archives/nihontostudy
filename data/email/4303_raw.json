If you are at all invested\nin th=\r\ne stock market (and most are nowadays due to 401k and IRA\naccounts and the =\r\nlike), you should be aware of the fraud perpetrated\nat the highest levels i=\r\nn the equity markets.  You may have recently\nheard of Gary Aguirre, a Secur=\r\nities and Exchange Commission\ninvestigator who had evidence of insider trad=\r\ning at Pequot Capital\nManagement, a large hedge fund.  In his pursuit of th=\r\ne investigation,\nhe asked to subpoena the former Pequot CEO who was in char=\r\nge during\nthe possible malfeasance.  But this person, John Mack, is a perso=\r\nnal\nfriend of, and large campaign contributor to, The Prez.  And so the\nins=\r\nider trading investigation was terminated without explanation by\nthe SEC ex=\r\necutives, and Mr. Aguirre was summarily fired, also without\nexplanation, an=\r\nd only eleven days after having received a glowing\nperformance evaluation a=\r\nnd substantial salary raise.  I don&#39;t wish to\nturn this board into a politi=\r\ncal rant&#39;n&#39;rave wastepit, and so will say\nno more here.  Nor do I encourage=\r\n anyone else to respond here.  I only\nwant to get the word out and perhaps =\r\nstimulate others to get hot on\nthis fraud issue and perhaps address it in b=\r\netter suited venues.  This\nincredible corruption is not a Democrat vs. Repu=\r\nblican dynamic, the\npoliticians are all in it, save a few such as Rep. Ron =\r\nPaul of Texas\nand Senator Tom Coburn of Oklahoma.  Otherwise, they mostly a=\r\nll\nprovide political cover for the large corporations and Wall Street\nfirms=\r\n raping the individual investors.  Here is the link to Mr.\nAguirre&#39;s testim=\r\nony today to the Senate Committee on the Judiciary. \nLengthy read, but well=\r\n worthwhile.  Whether you determine to do\nsomething or just close your eyes=\r\n, so be it (but no return rants here,\nplease).\n\nhttp://judiciary.senate.gov=\r\n/testimony.cfm?id=3D1972&wit_id=3D5485\n\nNC  :o(\n\n\n\n\n"
