Today I was watching an NBTHK novice course video and it has in the tsuba section, an interesting piece that had as its mimi, a ring that is perhaps 3 or 4 mm wide and it could be rotated. to try and explain this better, the, mimi would be like a tyre on a car wheel, the wheel doesn&#39;t turn but the tyre does, does this make sense ?????, maybe I should draw a picture LOL. \n\nWhat would be the purpose of this if any ?. purely aesthetics ?, or would it have some hidden function ?\n\nCheers\n\nRich\n\n\n---\nOutgoing mail is certified Virus Free.\nChecked by AVG anti-virus system (http://www.grisoft.com).\nVersion: 6.0.483 / Virus Database: 279 - Release Date: 19/05/2003\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
