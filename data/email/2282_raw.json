Going back again to =\r\nthe very minute-sized shakudo dragon menuki that received &quot;Kyo-kanagushi&quot; i=\r\nn Chicago. What had me thinking they might be, shall I say...higher quality=\r\n (?)...was the use of gold utori on the (male&#39;s) tail and the wiskers. It s=\r\nurprised me to think they (Kyo-kanagushi/late Edo anybody) did utori work. =\r\nUtori overlay always makes me think Momoyama. Anything worth expanding on h=\r\nere? Just curious.  \n\nRon\nSTL\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: Richa=\r\nrd Turner \n  To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Monday, October 04, =\r\n2004 5:17 PM\n  Subject: Re: [nihontostudy] Re: Kozuka\n\n\n  Excellent JIm, an=\r\nother lesson learnt, I will store that away for future \n  reference.\n\n  Tha=\r\nnks again\n\n  Rich\n\n  Jim Gilbert wrote:\n\n  &gt; Rich,\n  &gt; Kyo kanagu shi is =\r\n=E4=BA=AC Kyoto =E9=87=91=E5=85=B7 metal fittings =E5=B8=A5 maker.  (Althou=\r\ngh \n  &gt; dictionary definitions of this shi kanji are more like master or \n =\r\n &gt; commander, I haven&#39;t seen it translated that way for this compound \n  &gt; =\r\nterm.)  I have seen it used as an attribution on both NTHK and NBTHK \n  &gt; o=\r\nrigami. \n  &gt;\n  &gt; The meaning sounds rather similar to Kyo Kinko (=E4=BA=AC=\r\n=E9=87=91=E5=B7=A5), or Kyoto \n  &gt; metalsmith, but in practice usually desi=\r\ngnates somewhat lower quality \n  &gt; work.  A lot of mumei Edo period kozuka =\r\nand kogai made in Goto style, \n  &gt; but not actually Goto work, will get an =\r\nattribution to Kyo Kinko.  \n  &gt; Something that deviates further from Goto s=\r\ntyle and is a bit lower \n  &gt; quality will be called Kyo Kanagushi.  That&#39;s =\r\nnot an exhaustive \n  &gt; definition, but I hope it gives you some idea. \n  &gt;\n=\r\n  &gt; A lot of Edo period kinko material isn&#39;t distinctive enough to allow \n =\r\n &gt; an attribution to an individual or even a group.  For another example, \n=\r\n  &gt; a lot of later, average, unsigned menuki will be attributed to Kyo \n  &gt;=\r\n Kanagushi.  It&#39;s not necessarily bad stuff, but there&#39;s no way to \n  &gt; ide=\r\nntify it further.\n  &gt;\n  &gt; Your kozuka is probably borderline for passing du=\r\ne to the quality and \n  &gt; condition being a bit rough, but if it did, the a=\r\nttribution would \n  &gt; likely be Kyo kanagu shi based on what I&#39;ve observed.=\r\n\n  &gt;\n  &gt; Jim\n  &gt;\n  &gt;\n\n\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been remov=\r\ned]\n\n\n        Yahoo!
