For\n&gt; example, a gent was arrested, convicted and imprisoned for defending\n&gt; himself in his own home using a sword against an unarmed burglar who had\n&gt; broken into his house. I don&#39;t know specifically if possession of a\n&gt; bladed weapon is a problem, but any aggressive or defense use likely is\n&gt; a problem.\n&gt;\n&gt; Bob Elder wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Is possession of a cutting sword in England illegal?
