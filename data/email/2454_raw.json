I know in Certain\ncountries, like in Africa, the left hand is the\nbathroom hand.  you must take item in right and place\nin left.  Kids in school are smacked with rulers\nand/or other punishment if they don&#39;t abide.  That\nbeing said, lefties are obviously smarter because they\nhave the ability to use both sides of the brain while\nrighty&#39;s have just one dominent side (the left).  Even\nin Rocky, he didn&#39;t want the champ to fight a south\npaw.  I recall a few times on one of the internet\nlists some people having mounted swords for a lefty. \nI wonder how that plays given the traditionalist\nnature of martial arts/ sword teaching?\n\nKen\n--- Gordon Robson &lt;robsongo@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; What I meant was, as in my own case, I use my left\n&gt; hand for eating, writing\n&gt; and using small tools like scissors, but I play all\n&gt; sports with my right\n&gt; hand. I do not think that your typical right-handed\n&gt; person does that. \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Gordon\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: apedraza@...\n&gt; [mailto:apedraza@...] \n&gt; Sent: Tuesday, December 21, 2004 9:00 AM\n&gt; To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: RE: [nihontostudy] Musashi&#39;s sword\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Gordon,\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;I might add that to the best of my knowledge there\n&gt; is no such thing as an\n&gt; entirely left-handed person. Left-handed individuals\n&gt; either due to nurture\n&gt; or nature seem to do some things with the right-hand\n&gt; and others with the\n&gt; left and sometimes able to use both for the same\n&gt; thing.&lt;\n&gt; \n&gt; By that criteria, there are no entirely right-handed\n&gt; people, either,\n&gt; barring amputees or people with equivalent medical\n&gt; conditions. After\n&gt; all, my left hand/arm doesn&#39;t hang useless at my\n&gt; side.

There is some question as to whether\n&gt; or not they were\n&gt; for\n&gt; wear with the cutting edge down. I don&#39;t know of any\n&gt; illustrations\n&gt; showing\n&gt; right handed wear.

I have never, personally, seen\n&gt; illustrations of samurai\n&gt; wearing\n&gt; their swords on the right side, and it is not\n&gt; inconceivable that they\n&gt; were\n&gt; trained at an early age to use their swords in the\n&gt; conventional manner. \n&gt; The\n&gt; only advantage in being left handed is, surely, its\n&gt; comparative rarity\n&gt; and\n&gt; strangeness to a right-handed opponent.\n&gt; \n&gt; Interestingly, I have in my collection (WAY\n&gt; 386.27.ex Gardiner\n&gt; collection)\n&gt; an unsigned,  shakudo fuchi-gashira, attributed to\n&gt; Hirata Harunari  This\n&gt; has\n&gt; an ishime surface, with takaramono in a shippo of\n&gt; coloured enamels\n&gt; within\n&gt; gold cloissons.  The ura surface of the fuchi has\n&gt; had an additional\n&gt; takaramono added in gold lacquer, and this may\n&gt; possibly be to facilitate\n&gt; its\n&gt; wearing on the right side by presenting a more\n&gt; decorative surface.  I\n&gt; can\n&gt; think of no other possible explanation for this\n&gt; modification.\n&gt; \n&gt; John L.\n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been\n&gt; removed]\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo!
