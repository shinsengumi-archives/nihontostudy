I thought myself, Saotome maybe. =\r\nIt \nappears to be in the style of Nobuiye with a design of the moon, the su=\r\nn \nand the stars.\n\n85mm x 79mm x 3mm.\n\nhttp://www.nihontomessageboard.com/p=\r\nersonal/yamato_sword/tsuba_01.jpg\n\n2: This one has the distinction of being=\r\n maybe/apparently a Ninja Tsuba. \nOk, so I myself don&#39;t believe in Ninja, n=\r\not in the sense that we see \nthem in the films and think that if indeed, th=\r\ney existed past being \nrunners and murderers, and they used a sword, it wou=\r\nld probably have \nbeen pretty normal in it&#39;s shape and fittings, anyway, be=\r\nsides what I \nthink LOL.\n\nThis is a nice little tsuba, it is obviously made=\r\n for a katana going by \nthe size of the nakago ana, and the crescent moon H=\r\nitsu ana ume are very \nnice. We think they may have had shakudo on them, th=\r\nough I was wondering \nif it would have been the black patina that covers si=\r\nlver ??. It&#39;s a \nnice little piece.\n\n73mm x 63mm x 4mm\n\nhttp://www.nihontom=\r\nessageboard.com/personal/yamato_sword/tsuba_02.jpg\n\n3: This last one is sig=\r\nned and dated. OMI J=DB TSUNA (?) HIDE. I think it \nis Tsuna, I am pretty s=\r\nure it is in fact. and dated ( hard to read the \nday but I think it is ) AN=\r\nSEI YONNEN NIGATSU GOHI. 5th of Feb, 1857. It \nwas sold as a possible &quot;Exec=\r\nutioners Tsuba&quot;. It is quite thick, it&#39;s \ndimensions are 76mm x 69mm x 7mm =\r\nand the Nakago ana is very large \nsupposedly making it a &quot; one size fits al=\r\nl&quot; sort of thing with I guess, \nfresh Sekigane added each time.\n\nI have no =\r\nidea if that is what this was or is, as I said, we are opening \nthem up for=\r\n discussion and would be interested in all  your thoughts.\n\nhttp://www.niho=\r\nntomessageboard.com/personal/yamato_sword/tsuba_03.jpg\n\nCheers and thanks f=\r\nor taking the time to read.\n\nRich Turner\n\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this mes=\r\nsage have been removed]\n\n\n"
