I read on Mr Gilberts page about Akasaka Tsuba.\nhttp://home.earthlink.net/~jggilbert/akasaka.htm \n&lt;http://home.earthlink.net/%7Ejggilbert/akasaka.htm&gt;\nI quote.\n\n�Akasaka tsuba are constructed with a hard skin layer sandwiching \nsofter, inner layers. This can sometimes be seen on the mimi or in the \nwalls of the sukashi. I have not seen this technique used on either Kyo \nor Owari tsuba �.\n\nI took a hard look on my tsuba to see if I could see any layers. I took \nsome pictures of what I could see. I wonder if what the images \nrepresents could be just that. Or the layer displayed simply is due to \npatination?\nhttp://hem.bredband.net/odrike/Tsuba5detail.htm\nhttp://hem.bredband.net/odrike/Tsuba5.htm \n&lt;http://hem.bredband.net/odrike/Tsuba5detail.htm&gt;\n\nYou are mentioning that the surface doesn�t look like Akasaka and it \nmight be a late copy. Do you mean as in shiiremono?\n\nCould the surface be more suited for Tosa-Myochin which you are mentioning?\n\nHere are some dimensions if it could help.\n7.0 cm H x 6.8 cm W x 0.6 cm mimi and seppa dai\n\nThank you for your time.\nFredrik\n\n\nRichard Turner wrote:\n\n&gt;Hi Fredrik, very nice tsuba and not it is not a Chinese rip-off I can \n&gt;assure you. Akasaka would fit, as would Tosa Myochin. I notice there is \n&gt;no carving in the hira ( surface ) usually the tea whisks ( 3 and 9 \n&gt;o&#39;clock ) have the brush ( whisk ) lines carved in them and the Ginger \n&gt;leaves ( 12 and 6 o&#39;clock ) have usually 3 dots ( see this image \n&gt;http://www.nihontomessageboard.com/tsuba_collection/akasaka_tadatoki_tea.jpg \n&gt;)\n&gt;and 3 lines on them as well. The surface does not look like Akasaka \n&gt;plate to me, I may be wrong, it&#39;s quite rough and pitted up close. It \n&gt;could point to a late students work I guess, or a late copy, none the \n&gt;less, I think it is a late tsuba, as in the end of the Edo period sometime.\n&gt;\n&gt;Just some ramblings LOL, they may be all wrong.\n&gt;\n&gt;Rich\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Fredrik Persson wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Hi all,\n&gt;&gt;I would like to have some help kantei this tsuba. It was fitted on a \n&gt;&gt;mumei wakazashi I bought.\n&gt;&gt;http://hem.bredband.net/odrike/Tsuba5.htm\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;I have seen that Richard Turner have displayed some tsubas with same or \n&gt;&gt;similar design. Would the description of the design on this auction be \n&gt;&gt;accurate for my tsuba aswell?\n&gt;&gt;http://www.double-dragon-ebooks.com/NihontoAuctions/QAViewItem.asp?ItemID=45 \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Would it be possible to determine age or school? Akasaka has been \n&gt;&gt;mentioned for tsubas with same design. Could this one be an Akasaka?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Any information is appreciated even if you say it�s a Chinese copy.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Regards,\n&gt;&gt;Fredrik\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Yahoo!
