Asking $175\n \n \nRight and now o=\r\nn to the sword that I have for sale. This Nambokucho (14th\ncentury) sword w=\r\nas purchased last year from Aoi Arts in Japan. It comes with\nfairly recent =\r\nNBTHK Tokubetsu Hozon papers, a professional oshigata done at\nAoi Arts and =\r\ntheir own menu shaped certificate describing the sword and\nstating that it =\r\nwas then valued at 1,2 million yen. The sword is in a\nshirasaya, no koshira=\r\ne and is in excellent polish. I was toying with the\nidea of submitting it t=\r\no Juyo Shinsa, but have so far not got round to it. I\ndon&#39;t know if it woul=\r\nd stand a chance of going Juyo, but I think that it\nshould be submitted if =\r\nonly just for the experience which would be very\neducational in my opinion.=\r\n It is attributed to the Nakajima Rai school which\nseems to be pretty darn =\r\nrare. At least this is the only one I have ever\nseen. Below is the info exa=\r\nctly as on the Aoi Arts certificate.\n \n&#39;We certify the following Katana is =\r\ngenuine. Detail, Katana: the NBTHK\nTokubetsu-hozon token. \nSignature: Unsig=\r\nned, attributed to Nakajima-Rai. The blade is polished, in a\nshirasaya. Bla=\r\nde length: 62.7 cm or 24.69 inches.\nSori: 1.0 cm or 0.39 inch.\nWidth at the=\r\n hamachi: 2.98cm or 1.17 inches.\nWidth at the yokote: 2.11 cm or 0.83 inch.=\r\n\nThickness at the hamachi: 0.74 cm or 0.29 inch.\nEra: Nambokucho-period. 14=\r\nth century. \n \nShape: A shinogi-zukuri katana. Broadish blade has plenty th=\r\nickness and the\npoint is O-kissaki.\nJitetsu: Small mokume is combined with =\r\nsmall itame-hada. Fine jitetsu bears\ndelicate jinie.\nHamon: Nie-deki. Naka-=\r\nsuguha hamon goes with ashi, yo, kinsuji and\nsunagashi.\nBoshi: Niju-ba turn=\r\ns back roundly on the front. \n \nA glance at this sword shows that clearly R=\r\nai School tradition. Acceptable\no-hada appears about six inches above the h=\r\namachi. Superb jitetsu and\nsensitive works on the ha are the point of appre=\r\nciation. 1,200,000 Yen.&#39; \n \nI still have the original Aoi Arts pictures tha=\r\nt can be sent on request.\nAsking $12,500. \n \n \n \nThanks for taking the time=\r\n to read all this and let me know if I can be of\nany further help or if any=\r\n of you want pix or more detailed descriptions.\nmatthew@... \n \n- M=\r\natthew. \n \n\n\n    Z Recruiting Services\n    &quot;Zurich Toren&quot; Muzenstraat 89\n  =\r\n  2511 WB Den Haag\n    T: +31 70 4262273\n    F: +31 70 4262111\n    W: zrecr=\r\nuiting.com\n    E: info@...\n    Kijk ook op monsterboard.nl, job=\r\nbingmall.nl en \n    nationalevacaturebank.nl voor actuele vacatures!\n\n \n\n\n[=\r\nNon-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n \n\nYahoo!
