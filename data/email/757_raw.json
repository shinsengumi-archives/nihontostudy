Even with that uncertainty, the plate and the inlay don&#39;t look typical of Heianjo.  The Jingo did make guards in that rounded square shape and did use a deeply hammered modulation of the plate.  The condition may be confusing, but the apparent quality of the plate, the handling of the texture and the shape and placement of the ana don&#39;t come up to Jingo quality standards here.  They did do some brass suemon zogan dragons, but the style is different from this one.  The Higo Kinko Taikan has a lot of doubtful examples included, but if you can get a look at a copy, the Jingo section is worth comparing against your guard.\n\nMy guess is that it is some later worker trying to make something like a Jingo guard.  The handling of the plate is consistent with Shoami work.  The inlay is not exactly typical Shoami, but it&#39;s something that I&#39;d imagine any number of groups could have done.\n\nI think it&#39;s generally better to leave old lacquer alone, but with very rusted tsuba sometimes there is no way to keep it intact.  If it is fire scale, you won&#39;t be able to bone it off.\n\nAny other ideas?\nJim\n\n\n\n  gang,\n  I recently bought a rusty tsuba.............\n\n  dimension....3 inches x 3 1/4 inches\n  thickness..... a touch more than 3 mm, but less than 4mm\n  there is a &quot; groove around the rim with traces of lacquer so i \n  assumed a metal band was there but now missing.\n\n  looking at the dragon, at 2 O&#39;clock, I think the forearm is missing, \n  so the construction of the brass dragon could be &quot; layered &quot; ?\n  At 11 O&#39;clock, only 2 claws are visible so something is missing there \n  too.\n\n  questions..............\n  1. in rust removal using ivory, should i work around the traces of \n  lacquer leaving those intact ?\n  2.  any opinion as to school/time period ?\n  I am guessing....\n  a.  Heianjo  ( on a good day )?\n  b.  Jingo works ( on a very very good day )?\n  c. The all purpose Shoami ( no weather report here ) ??\n  d.  18th century or earlier ?\n\n  Thank you all in advance...........\n\n  the pics are in Milt&#39;s folder or klick on............\n\n  http://photos.groups.yahoo.com/group/nihontostudy/lst?&.dir=/milt%\n  27s&.src=gr&.view=t&.url=http%\n  3a//us.f1.yahoofs.com/groups/g_9963731/milt%2527s/tsuba%2b-%2bMVC-\n  001F.jpg%3fbcfRVXuBepvZKl4_&.cx=150&.cy=112&.type=u\n\n\n  milt\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
