I know\n&gt;   nothing of them, in fact =\r\nthe only reason I know they are called\n&gt;   &#39;Tsubas&#39; is because I saw one on=\r\n television this morning...\n&gt; \n&gt;   I Googled &#39;Tsuba&#39; and this group was one=\r\n of the first links I found. I\n&gt;   have tried - with difficulty - to identi=\r\nfy and date my tsuba.\n&gt; \n&gt;   So I thought I would seek help from people who=\r\n know about tsubas and\n&gt;   Japanese swords.\n&gt;   Here is a link to a photogr=\r\naph of it:\n&gt;   http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v340/donuil_dhu/_DSC0031.j=\r\npg\n&gt; \n&gt;   I think it may be bronze. And help I could get with identifying a=\r\nnd\n&gt;   dating it would be briliant! Thanks in advance!\n&gt; \n&gt;   Patrick\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\n  . \n&gt;    \n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"
