May dig out another uniquely structured namban that I featured in an old JSS/US article years back. That one appeared to be made in two pieces and the &quot;sides&quot; somehow &quot;welded&quot; together. Never came across another like it since that time. \n\nNamban are really interesting tsuba and I think they just got a bad rap years ago because of so many more &quot;common&quot; ones being found. You see some very nice namban work turn up on Japanese sites and when in Tokyo in October, I saw several very nice examples -- high priced examples, I might add. As with all kodogu, you have lots of average quality stuff, some average-good and then the lesser found great quality works. It&#39;s what makes this study so interesting!\n\nRon\nSTL\n\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: Dr John P Lissenden \n  To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Sunday, December 03, 2006 4:20 AM\n  Subject: [nihontostudy] Re: Masahisa\n\n\n  Dear Rick\n\n  Not wishing to be &#39;picky&#39;, I tend to believe that the mistaken \n  tendency to discount Namban tsuba is based upon their general poor \n  quality of design and production rather than upon the fact that they \n  are cast. In an attempt to salvage the reputation of this group \n  perhaps, if you ask him nicely, Ron Hartman will send you an image of \n  his Tokubetsu Hozon Namban tsuba?\n\n  Regards, John L.\n\n  --- In nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com, &quot;nihontochicken&quot; &lt;rick@...&gt; \n  wrote:\n  &gt;\n  &gt; Nothing of import to add, really. I would tend to think that were\n  &gt; Namban tsuba to have been in fact lost wax cast, this would help\n  &gt; explain their general value discount as compared to most similar\n  &gt; hand-chiseled pieces. \n  &gt; \n  &gt; NC\n  &gt; \n  &gt; P.S. - BTW, an email to my personal account on this topic was halted\n  &gt; by my mail server as &quot;spam&quot; and I don&#39;t know how to resurrect it, so\n  &gt; if there was anything unique in it, please post it to this board. \n  Thx.\n  &gt;\n\n\n\n   \n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
