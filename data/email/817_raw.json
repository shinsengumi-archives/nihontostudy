So many\nexceptional pieces in such a small space. \n\nDon&#39;t know if it was Rick or Dan I spoke with, but\nthey were nice to me as I pondered the hypnotic depth\nof blackness in some of the menuki. I wrote down the\nfellow&#39;s name, hoping to correspond further and get\nsome computer images if there were any to be had and\ncataloged. Unfortunately the name/address got lost in\nthe paper shuffle of travelling back to the east\ncoast.\n\nIf there are any images of that display available,\nsomeone please let me know. Coloration was beautiful\nand the designs so much more full than can be done\njustice in the Goto books I&#39;ve seen.\n\nCurran\n\n\n\n\n--- Ron Hartmann &lt;swords@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Lucien - \n&gt; \n&gt; I believe the NBTHK book by Fukushi Sensei is a very\n&gt; large volume that came out a year or so ago. If\n&gt; so--and I have a copy myself but have yet to really\n&gt; &quot;get into it&quot;--it is pricey and (I believe)\n&gt; out-of-print. The only book on Goto I had prior to\n&gt; this large work was the one titled: The 17\n&gt; Generations of Goto (Japanese text). I have this in\n&gt; both hard cover and soft cover, I believe both being\n&gt; the same inside the covers. It seems very good but\n&gt; as always, so much is missed unless you can read\n&gt; Japanese. \n&gt; \n&gt; Hopefully those who attended this year&#39;s San\n&gt; Francisco show saw the small but significant display\n&gt; of Goto fittings put on by Rick Mantigani and Dan\n&gt; Burns. Absolutely awesome kodogu! Unbelievable crisp\n&gt; and &quot;minty&quot; items of high, high quality makers! This\n&gt; display has been shown the last few years but I\n&gt; really wonder how many people stop to study the\n&gt; treasures displayed. \n&gt; \n&gt; Some of these Goto fittings--and others--have been\n&gt; included as special inserts (high quality photos and\n&gt; printing) in the Northern California group&#39;s\n&gt; newsletter from time to time. \n&gt; \n&gt; Ron\n&gt; STL\n&gt; \n&gt;   ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt;   From: JapaneseSwords@... \n&gt;   To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n&gt;   Sent: Sunday, September 21, 2003 4:12 PM\n&gt;   Subject: Re: [nihontostudy] goto kodogu study\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   Lucien,\n&gt; \n&gt;   The best Goto book out there is Goto Book from\n&gt; NBTHK By: Fukushi Sensei\n&gt;   Another good book is SWORD FITTINGS BY THE FAMILY\n&gt; OF GOTO  1440 - 1879 1994.  \n&gt;   Sano Art Museum, Nezu Institute of Fine Arts,\n&gt; Tokugawa Art Museum.\n&gt; \n&gt;   I&#39;m sure that there are other books on Goto\n&gt; fittings, but these two come to \n&gt;   mind first.\n&gt; \n&gt;   Lou\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   [Non-text portions of this message have been\n&gt; removed]\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;         Yahoo!
