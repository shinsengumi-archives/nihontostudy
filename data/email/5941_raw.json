Fred was leading and Jeff Miller was at \n&gt; the end and I was in the middle.\n&gt; \n&gt; First Fred picked up a sword looked at it and bought it.It was a great \n&gt; koto 28+ inch sword with some rust problems.He felt that he would be \n&gt; able to double his money, and did on Sunday.A little bit later, Jeff \n&gt; Miller picked up a blade that I had just set down - He did ask if I was \n&gt; done -looked at it, bought it and then walked across the room and sold \n&gt; it for a large profit.By this time I was wondering what was going on so \n&gt; I stepped around Fred and was leading the group.This time I was going to \n&gt; find the treasure!!!You are right. Very shortly, on swords I had passed \n&gt; by, both Fred and Jeff bought blades.After I whined a little bit, they \n&gt; did help me find a blade to add to my collection.\n&gt; \n&gt; At another show I remember Fred buying a sword. That evening he took the \n&gt; blade to his room and by the next day had cleaned up the blade and \n&gt; mountings so that he was able to sell at a profit.\n&gt; \n&gt; One show we decided to make the drive together. Coming home was great.We \n&gt; both had bought swords and when we were not driving, we were cleaning, \n&gt; or working on researching the smiths, talking about what made up the \n&gt; sword and why it was an example of that school.The trips will be much \n&gt; longer now.\n&gt; \n&gt; He will be missed.\n&gt; \n&gt; Later\n&gt; \n&gt; david\n&gt; \n&gt; -- \n&gt; -- \n&gt; David McDonald Collector of Japanese Swords and Old Iron\n&gt; PO Box 265 WEB page - http://www.montanairon.com\n&gt; Sidney MT 59270 email - jswords@...\n&gt; 406-482-3243 evenings I do tsukamaki (wrapping of sword hilts)\n&gt; \n&gt; Owner of White IH Cub& Super A Farmall, IH 100& 130, 140, AC G\n&gt; McD type M, Monitor, Frost King and other stationary engines.\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
