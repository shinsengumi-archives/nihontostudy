Indeed, a ca=\r\nst kagami is one of  the Three \nSacred \n&gt; Regalia of Japan.  Kagami-shi tsu=\r\nba, supposedly made in the pre-Edo \n&gt; period by mirror makers, may also be =\r\nof extremely high quality and \nit \n&gt; is not illogical to suppose that many =\r\nsoft-metal tsuba may have \n&gt; initially been cast.\n&gt; \n&gt; But the casting of i=\r\nron tsuba is, for some reason, very frowned \nupon by \n&gt; collectors.  I am p=\r\nersonally convinced that the vast majority of \nNamban \n&gt; tsuba are cast and=\r\n the poor quality of many of these makes this \nvery \n&gt; easy to detect with =\r\nthe use, simply, of a bright light and x30 \n&gt; magnification.  The ease with=\r\n which casting can be identified \nclearly \n&gt; depends upon the amount of han=\r\nd finishing which was utilised \nafterwards.\n&gt; \n&gt; Many people will justify t=\r\nhe casting of Manban tsuba as being \nexpected \n&gt; because of their poor qual=\r\nity, but I believe that casting may have \nbeen \n&gt; used far more generally t=\r\nhan is accepted.  It should be a simple \nmatter \n&gt; to confirm this, but suc=\r\nh examinations would need to be carried out \non \n&gt; tsuba of accepted high q=\r\nuality in order to avoid the a priori \nexcuse \n&gt; of &#39;poor quality&#39;.\n&gt; \n&gt; Wh=\r\nite cast iron is not a suitable metal for casting, but the \n&gt; carburisation=\r\n of grey cast iron to produce  a malleable cast iron, \n&gt; which is ideal for=\r\n casting small artefacts such as tsuba, is a \nprocess \n&gt; that has been know=\r\nn in Japan for several hundred years.\n&gt; \n&gt; As to whether the tsuba illustra=\r\nted in your photo album is cast or \nnot, \n&gt; I would hesitate to offer a fir=\r\nm opinion without a hands-on \n&gt; examination.  But my first impression is th=\r\ne absence of any clean, \n&gt; sharp chisel-work - I have my suspicions!\n&gt; \n&gt; R=\r\negards, John L.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Elliott&quot; &lt;ell=\r\niott@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; My question today is.........

I was told that \nit \n&gt; &gt; was made in Edo period, the me=\r\ni is Masahisa, the design of clouds \nwas \n&gt; &gt; carved or engraved, and in ov=\r\nal shape.
