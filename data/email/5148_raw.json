Obviously, the best way to learn is by studying examples with peers, but those opportunities seldom present themselves, especially here in the midwest. This dilemma presented itself again since the San Francisco show. Naturally, one thinks &quot;Goto&quot; when it comes to fine kogai, but of course there were many other makers to consider. Mike Yamasaki&#39;s Machibori display touched upon that. Remarking on a particular kogai exhibited by Mike, I commented that if the item had not been identified as one of the artists considered a machibori smith, I would had thought it Goto work! Mike pointed out that no, that this is wrong and that is wrong for Goto. How great it would be to sit down at length with good &quot;examples&quot; and with somebody of knowledge to compare and point out these kantei differences! &quot;Bits and pieces&quot; can be learned at shows, but that&#39;s about it. \n\n  My question to the groups is: what sources of information have you found to be really useful -- teachable material -- that helped you understand kogai and to differenciate between the different schools who made kogai. I have a good library after all these years, but it is surprising what little information is here that helps. Certainly, good photos exist (mostly on Goto works) but there must be some material out there in publication that &quot;compares&quot; the work of different groups, pointing out the differences. How great it must be to be in Japan or California or New York and to have opportunities to do this with real examples!!! Any suggestions for those of us living outside of those areas? \n\nRon\nSTL\n\n  \n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
