He is listing if for quite a bit \ncheaper than he paid for it.\n\nIt is hard to find a NTHK papered Echizen 27 inch katana for \n$2,625.00 - if not impossible.  The blade is in old polish and has \nsome slight inactive rust in the kissaki - not very bad at all.\n\nThe blade has a very nice feel to it, it is not a heavy blade at all.\n\nhttp://www.japaneseswordcollector.com/echsek/echsek.html\n\nPlease contact me if interested.\n\nRegards,\n\nLouis Skebo\n\n\n\n\n\n"
