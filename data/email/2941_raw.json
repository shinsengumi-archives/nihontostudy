A four-sided spear blade is a ryo-shinogi-yari. \n\n\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: Ron Hartmann \n  To: TOKEN ; nihontostudy ; nihonto@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Thursday, May 05, 2005 12:05 PM\n  Subject: [nihontostudy] Yari type\n\n\n  Hi All - \n\n  Can anyone tell me the correct (accepted today) name for a yari I&#39;m making a record sheet on today? To describe it, it is a stubby, short (4&quot;) head, 4-sided yari made with yokote. This one is quite nice and signed by Yokoyama Bizen Sukehira (shinshin-to). \n\n  In Kajihara&#39;s glossery (p.250) illustrates what I would say is that shape/form, but a number of names are given for it: tanpo yari, te yari, ko-yari, kago yari, mijika-yari. \n\n  The mijika-yari elaborates, saying &quot;short, straight yari of 3 to 6 sun.&quot; This sounds like what my yari would be but then the other types are simply identified by a name (which I can not translate, other than the ko-yari). Any answer to this?\n\n  Can anyone comment on Knutsen&#39;s latest publication on pole arms, if it is useful...cost and sources? I&#39;ve yet to buy a copy and have already forgotten the name of this latest Knutsen publication. \n\n  Ron\n  STL\n\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  Yahoo!
