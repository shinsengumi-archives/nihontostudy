I will wait for it&#39;s arrival, photograph \ni=\r\nt to the best of my abilities and we can have a good old kantei session \non=\r\n it.\n\nExcellent Jim.\n\nRich\n\nJim Gilbert wrote:\n\n&gt; I also think that it&#39;s to=\r\no old for Tosa Myochin and that the tagane \n&gt; are not as clear as the ones =\r\nthey used.  But, to be an even wetter \n&gt; blanket, I&#39;m not convinced that it=\r\n&#39;s Akasaka either.  The Akasaka \n&gt; weren&#39;t the only group to use this desig=\r\nn.  The edges of the sukashi \n&gt; show some rounding and beveling, where Akas=\r\naka is usually quite sharp \n&gt; and vertical.  The texture of the iron looks =\r\na bit softer and grainier \n&gt; than Akasaka.  The shape of the design element=\r\ns is also softer and \n&gt; looser than typical for Akasaka, compare the detail=\r\ns with the signed \n&gt; example in the Sano catalog.  Note also that the seppa=\r\n dai is wider \n&gt; than that one.  Some things to consider.\n&gt;\n&gt; Jim\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  =\r\n Hi Ron, a nice observation. and possibly correct. I went right through\n&gt;  =\r\n the Akasaka books and cannot find a single tsuba with the \n&gt; kakushi-tagan=\r\ne\n&gt;   though straight lines were used form time to time by the second\n&gt;   T=\r\nadamasa. Akasaka and Tosa Myochin can at times be very hard to \n&gt; separate\n=\r\n&gt;   I find but it is these little tips that help separate them that make \n&gt;=\r\n the\n&gt;   job just a tad easier.\n&gt;\n&gt;   I guess one thing is, when in hand, i=\r\nt&#39;s look of age might help. Sasano\n&gt;   reports that the Tosa Myochin group =\r\nstarted in the mid 1800&#39;s or there\n&gt;   abouts. I have a signed Tosa Myochin=\r\n tsuba signed Toshu ju Kuniyoshi\n&gt;   Saku ( shoshin according to Hagihara s=\r\nensei ) that would date to about\n&gt;   1780 - 1800. I know Cary has a Tosa My=\r\nochin piece about the same age. I\n&gt;   have not heard of them earlier than t=\r\nhat, has anyone else ?. I kind of\n&gt;   think from the images, this tsuba of =\r\nmine looks older than the 1800&#39;s,\n&gt;   but then again, as I a said, when I h=\r\nave it in hand, it may be \n&gt; easier to\n&gt;   tell.\n&gt;\n&gt;   Anyway, food for tho=\r\nught, I like Tosa Myochin also as a school and \n&gt; would\n&gt;   not be upset if=\r\n it turned out that way.\n&gt;\n&gt;   best wishes\n&gt;\n&gt;   Rich\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; [Non-text por=\r\ntions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ----------------------------=\r\n--------------------------------------------\n&gt; *Yahoo!
