Liverpool Museum has mounts of identical type in its\ninventory.\n \nThe mystery of the beveled saya has also now been answered by Steve. The\nbevel is because the Wak was part of a daisho the katana would also have a\nbevel so the two sit tightly together in the belt. This also confirms the\nblade was carried by a Samurai!\n \nhttp://www.c.farrar.btinternet.co.uk/wak/Dscf0073.jpg\n \nPeter\n \n  _____  \n\nFrom: Jim Gilbert [mailto:jggilbert@...] \nSent: 12 March 2004 03:49\nTo: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: Re: [nihontostudy] Wakizashi Help\n \nPeter,\nThe original metal fittings appear to be a set by one maker or at least a\nsingle workshop.  I think that they could be work from Shonai in northern\nHonshu.  Is the fuchi or tsuba signed?  The kozuka is a later substitution\nof lower quality.  I can&#39;t really see the menuki in the photos.  The kashira\nappears to be of a different material.  I&#39;m guessing that it may have been\nlost and that the tsuka has been rewrapped, but I can&#39;t see much in the\nphotos.\n\nThe bevel on the saya would be up against the body when the sword was worn\nso it&#39;s probably not just for show.  My guess is that it might be more\ncomfortable to wear or would help position it somehow (?).  It&#39;s an unusual\nfeature.  Does anyone know what it&#39;s called or what it is really for?\n\nAs a lone wakizashi it could have been worn by a non-samurai, but I don&#39;t\nsee anything about the koshirae that would make that necessarily so.  \n\nJim\n\n\n\n\n  Hi,\n\n  Can anyone assist me with this Wakizashi? I&#39;m after more information on\nthe\n  style and school of the mounts. I was told that due to the style of the\n  mounts it would have been a merchants or high class civilian&#39;s sword. Can\n  anyone confirm or deny this?\n  The grove cut into the saya does look to be a kind of fashion statement.\nThe\n  blade is out of polish but looks to have a gunome hamon.\n\n  http://www.c.farrar.btinternet.co.uk/wak/\n\n  Thanks for any assistance anyone can offer!\n\n  Peter\n\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n  _____  \n\nYahoo!
