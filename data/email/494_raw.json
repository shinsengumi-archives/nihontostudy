The made a number of standard shaped and sized iron plates of relatively poor quality for their tsuba and had a book of designs that a customer could choose from and have it mounted on the pre-made plate.  That is why you see so many Mito tsuba with  identical designs on them.\n\nJohn\n\n\n\n----- Original Message ----- \n  From: alchemyst \n  To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Monday, July 07, 2003 2:58 AM\n  Subject: [nihontostudy] Re: Mito vs Mito shoami\n\n\n  Ken -\n\n  I&#39;m not an expert, but here&#39;s my take on it.\n  No they are not the same school. Mito is\n  not the same as Mito Shoami although they\n  both worked in the same area and undoubtedly\n  there is some contact. Styles are somewhat similar,\n  but IMHO, Mito Shoami does the better work.\n  There is some fine Mito work also. Mito tends\n  to be more copying of Nara school, using a lot\n  of shiriimono plates and styles. I hope Jim\n  will fill in the gaps and correct any errors\n  in the above.\n\n  Rich\n  ------------------------------------------------------------\n  Richard Stein, PhD          alchemyst@...\n        \n               The Japanese Sword Index\n    http://www.geocities.com/alchemyst/nihonto.htm\n\n\n    No trees were killed in the sending of this message.\n  However, a large number of electrons were inconvenienced.\n  ------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n        Yahoo!
