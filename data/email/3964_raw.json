Nobuie, Hoan, Yamakichibei.\n\nAlso note the tea wares that were in fashion at the time and very highly valued as well.  Raku, Shino, Oribe.  Worth looking up if you&#39;re not familiar with ceramics.\n\nIt is true in tea ware at the time that earlier, purely utilitarian, non-art pieces were sometimes elevated to high regard and staggering monetary value.\n\nJim\n\n\n\n  Something which has bothered me for some time now is the lack of \n  historic record keeping of the early tsubako (pre Edo).  With the \n  exception of the Goto there doesn&#39;t seem to be too much of a record.  \n  Now there was a record of the sword smiths.  This is why I question \n  the &#39;relative&#39; value of the tsubako before Edo.  After the civil war \n  period artistic merit became more important and all of a sudden we \n  see records of the tsubako.  It may be possible that we are \n  dogmatizing the whole iron tsuba field, in other words making it more \n  important than it was ever viewed by the people of those times.  Now \n  it is also important to remember that there is nothing wrong with \n  recognizing artistic beauty where it was not appreciated before.  I \n  just have to wonder if sometimes we are overdoing it, that&#39;s all.  \n  The &#39;beautiful&#39; tekotsu bumplies on the mimi were just not worth the \n  time or effort to smooth off, and the &#39;surface texturing&#39; was done to \n  hide the irregularities in the metal.  \n\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
