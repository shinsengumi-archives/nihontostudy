It was gold &quot;plate&quot; as you say.\n\nSolid gold tsuba are pretty rare today.  The same owner has another one,\nalso Umetada and both from around the Momoyama period.  I doubt that they\nwere ever common, but probably most examples were melted down once they were\nno longer in use.  The Umetada ones are finished with very controlled file\nmarks like the ones seen on their habaki of the period.\nJim\n\n\n\n  cool, thanks Jim. How many tsuba would have been solid gold ?. I am not\ngoing to remember the smith but there is a lovely gold foiled/sheet ? plated\ntsuba ( I think ) in Comptons 100 famous swords. Part of a complete set of\nkoshirae I believe. It features paulownia flowers over waves from memory.\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYahoo!
