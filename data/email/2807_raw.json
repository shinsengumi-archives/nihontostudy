Most of the replies\nwere off list. It was a good introduction to Hirata\ntsuba.\n\nThe major thing learned by me was to look closely at\nthe fukurin on such tsuba if you don&#39;t have then in\nhand. The quality of workmanship there can be the most\nrevealing to those like myself who are newbie to\nHirata tsuba. The fukurin of the tsuba in discussion\nseemed to be suspect- but is not a certain thing-,\nplus it was discussed that there have been a number of\nsemi-modern ones floating around within the last year.\n   In addition, it was discussed that a good number of\nconvincing &quot;post edo&quot; produced katchushi tsuba have\npopped up recently and are being passed off as older\nworks.\n\nThanks all for the information.\n\nCurran\n\n\n--- Jim Gilbert &lt;jggilbert@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Curran,\n&gt; The cloisonnï¿½ Hirata people worked in Kyoto.  You&#39;re\n&gt; talking about Hirata in Higo.  I&#39;m not aware of any\n&gt; connection between the groups other than the shared\n&gt; name.\n&gt; \n&gt; Hirata Hikozo did a lot of work in copper alloys. \n&gt; Most plates are yamagane or copper, but some are\n&gt; shinchu or shakudo.  Many of them are lacquered. \n&gt; The mimi edge you&#39;re talking about is a fukurin (rim\n&gt; cover) and Hikozo often used them, usually in a\n&gt; contrasting metal.  I think that you&#39;re describing\n&gt; an Odawara fukurin, which was a particular specialty\n&gt; of Hikozo.  Many Hirata guards have the concentric\n&gt; circle file marking you mention, but others have\n&gt; amida yasurime, irregular or polished surfaces. \n&gt; Many do have a distinctive taganemei of heavy, domed\n&gt; punch marks along the sides of the nakago ana.\n&gt; \n&gt; I can&#39;t say what you have without seeing it.  There\n&gt; have been contemporary copies of Hikozo&#39;s work for\n&gt; sale at US sword shows recently.  I don&#39;t think that\n&gt; they were made to deceive since they are very\n&gt; obviously brand new, shiny and not at all in the\n&gt; taste of the original time and place.  On the other\n&gt; hand, a couple of them turned up at the Chicago\n&gt; shinsa, so someone may have gotten a little\n&gt; confused.  I have no idea how the sellers are\n&gt; representing these guards.\n&gt; \n&gt; Jim\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   List-\n&gt; \n&gt;   I have recently been looking at a (non cloissone)\n&gt;   Hirata style tsuba: \n&gt; \n&gt;   -It is not iron, but rather seems copper.\n&gt;   -It is plain, unmarked, with the plate being\n&gt; covered\n&gt;   in dark lacquer.\n&gt;   -The mimi edge is done in a sort of silver or\n&gt; other\n&gt;   metal crimped onto the place and fashioned to look\n&gt;   slightly like the edges of an abalone shell or\n&gt; other\n&gt;   mollusk &lt;sorry, I&#39;m not a marine biologist&gt;.\n&gt; \n&gt;   ---All in all, sort of a common plain-jane Hirata\n&gt;   style design. The seppa dai area does have those\n&gt; big\n&gt;   pock marks I see on Hirata tsuba.\n&gt; \n&gt;   I am wondering if this is just a very late Hirata,\n&gt; a\n&gt;   Meiji era export, or an attempt to imply Hirata &lt;I\n&gt; had\n&gt;   recently discussed a gi-taganamei Higo Kamiyoshi\n&gt; tsuba\n&gt;   with Jim G., in that the unsigned tsuba had\n&gt;   hammermarks to imply it was the work of second\n&gt;   generation Kamiyoshi &quot;Fukanobu&quot;&gt;.\n&gt;      On what little I have seen and very little I\n&gt; know\n&gt;   of such Hirata tsuba, they always have radial\n&gt; marks on\n&gt;   the plate to add to the design impression of a\n&gt; shell.\n&gt;   This one been flat and black lacquered, seems very\n&gt;   odd.\n&gt; \n&gt;   Thank you in advance to any replies,\n&gt; \n&gt;   Curran \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been\n&gt; removed]\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________ \nDo you Yahoo!? \nPlan great trips with Yahoo!
