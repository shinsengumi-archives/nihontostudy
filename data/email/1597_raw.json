I think it is because the original hole was thought too low for Edo\nperiod mounts. I think you would need to do a comparison of Tensho period\nshort sword mounts and later Edo period mounts to confirm that. I might add\nthat it is a common complaint among collectors of Seki works in Japan, and\nalso adds to the problem of identifying the distinctions among the\ngenerations if you can&#39;t fully read the kane character. There does not seem\nto be the same problem with katana. This would be a good subject for a paper\nRon.\n\n \n\nGordon\n\n \n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Ron Hartmann [mailto:swords@...] \nSent: Tuesday, February 03, 2004 8:17 AM\nTo: TOKEN; nihontostudy; nihonto@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: [nihontostudy] Seki Kanemasu\n\n \n\nHi all - \n\nThis is directed to anybody out there who might own a sword by Seki\nKanemasu. Looking at Nihonto&#39;s site today I noticed Fred has a Kanemasu\ntanto for sale. I own two such tanto by Kanemasu, one having been featured\nas &quot;Tanto of the Month&quot; in Benson&#39;s Bushido publication years ago. \n\nI find it quite curious that all of the Kanemasu tanto I&#39;ve seen--my own and\nothers illustrated--seem to have two mekugi-ana. One is into the Kane\ncharacter and the other centered on the nakago above the mei. It makes me\nwonder if this was a happenchance of remounting or if perhaps it was some\nsort of &quot;trademark&quot; of this smith. I&#39;d like to find out if any of you own a\nKanemasu and if so, how does its nakago/menuki-ana look? Hopefully, one or\ntwo will be in your hands. \n\nRon\nSTL\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n  _____  \n\nYahoo!
