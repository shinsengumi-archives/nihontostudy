It is true, of course, that her \nc=\r\nannonballs were almost certainly of cast iron;  I believe that by \nthe end =\r\nof the C16 stone cannonballs had been virtually completely \nreplaced by iro=\r\nn.  It is thus possible that these might be considered \nas one possible sou=\r\nrce of namban iron.\n\nRegards, John L.\n\n\n--- In nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com=\r\n, &quot;excelsiorilluminati&quot; \n&lt;excelsiorilluminati@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi Dr. Lissen=\r\nden, John, I believe you are right on about the cannon \n&gt; being unlikely to=\r\n be iron. Bronze cannon were so much easier to \n&gt; produce and less likely t=\r\no fail than iron. The only difference of \n&gt; import at this time is bronze w=\r\nas more expensive to use. So, I went \n&gt; to a forum where there are some ded=\r\nicated historians. I paste the \n&gt; answers below.\n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Anyway, this migh=\r\nt answer your question. The book &#39;The Dutch \n&gt; Discovery Of Japan&#39; by Dirk =\r\nJan Barreveld (which is full of errors, \n&gt; but still helpful in gaining an =\r\nunderstanding of Dutch trade) \nstates \n&gt; that a report filed by a Jesuit se=\r\nnt to inspect the ship says that \n&gt; the ship had &#39;19 pieces of guns made of=\r\n bronze&#39; (other sources give \n&gt; the number as 18 or 26). \n&gt; From Turnbull&#39;s=\r\n Osaka book-Ieyasu had 10 European cannon at the \n&gt; battles of Osaka in 161=\r\n4-15. 5 were Dutch made &#39;Ishibaya&#39; cannons \n&gt; (which fired shot ranging fro=\r\nm 12 lbs to 35-40 lbs-it&#39;s unclear \nwhich \n&gt; type Ieyasu had, though). Thes=\r\ne were likely from the cannon taken \n&gt; from DeLiefde. The other 5 were boug=\r\nht from the English East India \n&gt; Company and were invoiced by Richard Cock=\r\ns on December 5, 1614. \nThey \n&gt; included 4 culverins (17.5 lbs) and one sak=\r\ner (5.5 lbs). Out of \nabout \n&gt; 300 artillery pieces Ieyasu fielded at Osaka=\r\n, these were the only \n&gt; heavy siege guns apart from one Japanese gun. This=\r\n was \n&gt; the &#39;Shinbatsuji&#39; gun, which was made by Shibatsuji Ryuemon \nSukeno=\r\nbu. \n&gt; It was about 11 feet long with a 90 mm bore, and fired shot about \nt=\r\nhe \n&gt; same size as small Dutch cannon. Unfortunately, it&#39;s not noted what \n=\r\n&gt; they&#39;re made of-the picture of the Japanese gun (which is at \n&gt; Yasukuni)=\r\n looks like it was bronze. My Japanese books would likely \n&gt; have this info=\r\n, but they&#39;re not here .\n&gt; \n&gt; AND\n&gt; \n&gt; Samurai William, p.91, states that t=\r\nhe Liefde&#39;s cannon were bronze\n&gt; \n&gt; I still await more information on possi=\r\nble early sources for \n&gt; nambantetsu. I will let you know. It seems so far =\r\nthat article has \na \n&gt; lot of supposition.

Although =\r\n\ncast-\n&gt; iron \n&gt; &gt; cannon became available ca 1550, these were much more di=\r\nfficult \nto \n&gt; &gt; cast, and bronze remained the metal of choice until the mi=\r\nd to \nlate \n&gt; &gt; C17.  Since the &#39;De Liefde&#39; arrived in Kyushu in 1600, is i=\r\nt not \n&gt; highly \n&gt; &gt; likely that its cannon were of bronze rather than of i=\r\nron?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Is there an expert on cannon out there somewhere who can clar=\r\nify \n&gt; this \n&gt; &gt; point for me?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Regards, John L.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Barry Thomas&quot; &lt;warlor=\r\nd@&gt; \n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; All,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;ve just discovered this littl=\r\ne gem about the history of \nNamban \n&gt; &gt; tetsu (foreign steel) in Japanese h=\r\nistory and the involvement of \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; Dutch V.O.C.
