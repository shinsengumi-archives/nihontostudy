Apps such as Photoshop \nexcel at this and also XnView which is free is a very good option. I \nwork in Film and Television so this is something I am quite experienced \nin (as is Jim G our fearless leader)\n\nI think there would be a good interest in the US and a lesser \ninternational interest though selling any form of book to the younger \ngeneration seems a daunting task. What do they need books for, they have \nthe internet.\n\nRich\n\nOn 13/09/2010 8:13 AM, Dean wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Richard,\n&gt;\n&gt; I presume you are suggesting downgrading the jpg photos to smaller \n&gt; sizes. I can do that; however, it does reduce the quality of detail. \n&gt; Do you not have highspeed internet?\n&gt;\n&gt; I am thinking about reproducing the catalog, complete with Dad&#39;s notes \n&gt; and adding pages of the show pictures. Do you think there is a market \n&gt; for a paper copy (~$40)?\n&gt;\n&gt; Dean\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n&gt; &lt;mailto:nihontostudy%40yahoogroups.com&gt;, Richard Turner &lt;ikkanshi@...&gt; \n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hi Dean, yes I agree, it&#39;s a brilliant job. One thing I would \n&gt; suggest is\n&gt; &gt; getting a little smarter with your photos as the page takes a long time\n&gt; &gt; to load. I down loaded one photo and it is 2.3 meg. Given that there \n&gt; are\n&gt; &gt; many images there it will slow down the loading considerably and also\n&gt; &gt; eat into peoples bandwith depending on their connection speeds.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; There are some easy ways to alleviate this and if you would like to\n&gt; &gt; discuss them please just let me know. I would be happy to help you.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Cheers\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Richard Turner\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; On 13/09/2010 3:20 AM, lorrez_d wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Amazing work you&#39;re doing there !
