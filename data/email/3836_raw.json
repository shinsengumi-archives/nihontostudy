The tsuba in question does not seem to me to have the age to the plate to justify such an attribution.\n\nThe metal in the plate, at least in the picture, shows no resemblance to any of the plates worked by the Yoshiro artists.  Also the theme and design is not one that they were know to produce.  \n\nThey were a very popular group in their day, their work was in high demand and available only to the wealthy.  I find it difficult to believe that they would produce something so drastically different from what their bread and butter products were.\n\nJohn\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: Jim Gilbert \n  To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Monday, February 27, 2006 7:34 PM\n  Subject: Re: [nihontostudy] Re: tsuba school\n\n\n  That is a strange call indeed.  Nunome zogan and relief carving are not Yoshiro traits.  If anyone has seen a signed Yoshiro example with either I&#39;d like to hear about it.\n\n  Jim\n\n\n  There are certainly some unexpected Yoshiro papered attributions out there, aren&#39;t there?\n\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n  SPONSORED LINKS Buy fine art  Japanese translation  Japanese incense  \n        Fine art inkjet paper  Fine art printing  Fine art appraisal  \n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  YAHOO!
