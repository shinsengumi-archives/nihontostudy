Some might challenge my view by asking, =A1=B0But I do find \nthat drago=\r\nn designs appear on robes that Chinese emperor used to \nwear.=A1=B1 That is=\r\n quite right. Only that custom as a rule is quite \nexceptional in case of t=\r\nsuba. We all know that tsuba is intended for \nhand protection. The tsuba wi=\r\nll receive heavy chopping force \ninitiated by the enemy. In case of dragon =\r\ntsuba sword, it would mean \nthat the emperor was getting hit each time the =\r\ntsuba received chops \nby the enemy. Damage of any kind on the dragon of thi=\r\ns tsuba would \nimply that the emperor=A1=AFs fate would soon be as damaged =\r\nas the tsuba.\nThere never was rules prohibiting Chinese craftsman to produc=\r\ne tsuba \nwith dragon insignia on it. The idea simply would not come up in \n=\r\nanyone=A1=AFs mind in China. As a matter of fact I seriously doubt that \nth=\r\ne Japanese sword bearing this dragon tsuba never ever reached \nChinese Pala=\r\nce. The Chinese Foreign Trade officer would have singled \nit out from the l=\r\nist of Japanese contributions and confiscated the \nsword along with the pal=\r\nms burning dragon tsuba. A sword=A1=AFs blade \nwith dragon designs engraved=\r\n on it? Yes, it is possible. And I \nmyself can show you ancient swords to t=\r\nhat effect. Why was it \npossible? Well, blade is something that has power o=\r\nf hitting ones \nenemy. The idea goes harmoniously well with the powerful im=\r\nage of an \nemperor. You just could not put a Chinese emperor on a tsuba in =\r\nform \nof a dragon in order to expose His powerless position of getting hit =\r\n\nrepeatedly by his enemy.\nThe issue of whether or not this tsuba being made=\r\n in Japan really \nrest with the authentication result of the dragon design =\r\nitself. \nThere are differences in terms of detail design between Japan and =\r\n\nChina. May be the Japanese royal artifact specialist would be more \nintere=\r\nsted to do the authentication. I strongly believe that, well \nmade or not, =\r\nthis tsuba was of Japanese origin. \nI have posted two more photos of the ts=\r\nuba I am referring to just in \ncase anyone of you would like to take a stro=\r\nnger view. (Photos \nplaced in folder named SOSIDORE)\nIn my previous message=\r\n I once proclaimed that five claws and only \nfive claws can prove that the =\r\ndragon concerned was exclusively \ncrafted for Chinese emperor. It was not t=\r\nrue. The more I studied the \nmore evidence indicated that four claws or eve=\r\nn three claws dragons \nhad been found to be owned by Chinese emperors. Sorr=\r\ny for \nmisinformation.\n\nChen, Ying-chaw\n\n\n--- In nihontostudy@yahoogroups.c=\r\nom, &quot;Barry Thomas&quot; &lt;warlord@i...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Mr Chen Ying-chaw wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; It was Japan who kept the record in detail about presenting\n&gt; &gt; swords t=\r\no Chinese emperors during 15th century. (Reference\n&gt; &gt; -----in Chinese:\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n http://www.chinadaojian.com.cn/ctdj/chinadj/200510/140.html\n&gt; &gt; Historic R=\r\necord on Marshal Art --Swords and Knife-- Exchange\n&gt; &gt; Between China and Ja=\r\npan. -----written in Chinese citing among\n&gt; &gt; others Japanese record)\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nYes, of course Mr Chen Ying-chaw, you are right.  I believe this \nis known =\r\nas the\n&gt; Kango Trade in the Kamakura period and later.  This was published =\r\n\nin English\n&gt; about 25 or so years ago in the USA - one of the Tai Kai \npub=\r\nlications. I had not\n&gt; read of the Trade in the early Shinto period/late Mi=\r\nng, but of \ncourse this is\n&gt; not a well-researched area in the West, nor, I=\r\n guess, in China \neither given the\n&gt; vicissitudes of the past 110 years.  W=\r\nith this lack of knowledge \nit isn&#39;t\n&gt; surprising that no one (?) on this l=\r\nist knows anything about such \na tsuba as Mr\n&gt; Chen Ying-chaw has drawn our=\r\n attention to.  So, given this lack of \nspecific\n&gt; knowledge about the Japa=\r\nn-China trade in Nihonto I can only go by \nthe tsuba AS A\n&gt; TSUBA in the co=\r\nntext of my Japanese-centred knowledge.  More and \nbetter quality\n&gt; images =\r\nof this very interesting tsuba are warranted given the \nqueries and issues\n=\r\n&gt; raised.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ve looked long and hard at the very interesting image Mr C=\r\nhen \nYing-chaw has\n&gt; drawn our attention to, and I note the following:\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n - the quality of the work is poor.\n&gt; - note particularly the asymmetric sh=\r\nape of the nakago ana, as I \nhave mentioned\n&gt; - note also the clumsy, unref=\r\nined shape of the seppa dai outline\n&gt; - note also the nakago ana placement =\r\nin the seppa dai lacks \nsymmetry.\n&gt; - finally, the mimi (rim) varies in wid=\r\nth in a manner most \nuncharacteristic of\n&gt;   Japanese tsubako.\n&gt; \n&gt; Being f=\r\namiliar with the exquisite excellence of Japanese metal \nwork in tsuba and\n=\r\n&gt; fuchigashira, I cannot accept that this tsuba was made under the \nauspice=\r\ns of the\n&gt; Japanese Emperor for the Chinese Emperor.  Let me propose anothe=\r\nr \ntheory.\n&gt; \n&gt; Mr Chen Ying-chaw notes:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; 1. Chinese emperor was the =\r\nonly one who is entitled\n&gt; &gt; to put dragon decors on everything he owned.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; 2. However dragons could also put to use as icons by\n&gt; &gt; other persons o=\r\nr entities only if the number of dragon&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; fingers reduced to either 4 o=\r\nr 3. Five fingers claws must\n&gt; &gt; not be used in any dragon unless the owner=\r\n of that\n&gt; &gt; dragon design is Chinese emperor himself. Violation of\n&gt; &gt; suc=\r\nh rule was subject to capital punishment.\n&gt; \n&gt; However, in Japan the dragon=\r\n is a very common theme on all manner \nof things.\n&gt; Granted I have only see=\r\nn 3 fingered dragons in Japanese art, but \nthe so-called\n&gt; Canton tsuba wer=\r\ne imported into Japan and I suggest that this \ntsuba could be of\n&gt; Chinese =\r\norigin intended to be exported to Japan at one time.  \nSupporting this\n&gt; th=\r\neory is the observation that this tsuba appears to have never \nbeen fitted =\r\nto a\n&gt; sword, as indeed a great number of Japanese tsuba were never \nfitted=\r\n to swords.\n&gt; I cannot recall seeing hitsuana of the specific type shown in=\r\n the \nimage.\n&gt; \n&gt; Finally, Mr Chen Ying-chaw wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Time and again i=\r\nn China, very fine quality old Japanese\n&gt; &gt; swords (for royal use?) can sti=\r\nll be found. Some with\n&gt; &gt; tsuba missing\n&gt; \n&gt; Some years ago there was a ve=\r\nry comprehensive (but not particularly\n&gt; informative!) exchange of views on=\r\n Nihonto in China on these sword \nlists - I\n&gt; still have the correspondence=\r\n in my archive.  There was no \nconclusive\n&gt; information of &quot;very fine quali=\r\nty old Japanese swords&quot; being found \nin China.\n&gt; I&#39;m sure we would all like=\r\n to hear more about such finds with \npictures and\n&gt; scholarly information i=\r\nf they exist.  Indeed, the article on the \nKango Trade\n&gt; speculated that ma=\r\nny of the very best quality Koto were exported \nto China and\n&gt; hoped that s=\r\nome could still be found and restored to the world.\n&gt; \n&gt; This exhausts my p=\r\noor and inadequate opinion, so now I will retire \nfrom the\n&gt; lists and hope=\r\n someone can offer a more definitive opinion.  I \nstand by my\n&gt; opinion tha=\r\nt this is NOT a Japanese-made item.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; \n&gt; Barry Thomas\n&gt; =\r\n(Melbourne, Australia)\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ----- Original Message -----\n&gt; From: &quot;sosido=\r\nre&quot; &lt;sosidore@y...&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Thursday, =\r\nNovember 17, 2005 2:29 PM\n&gt; Subject: [nihontostudy] Re: A good story about =\r\none tsuba with some \ninteresting\n&gt; details missing\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; It was Japan who=\r\n kept the record in detail about presenting swords \nto\n&gt; Chinese emperors d=\r\nuring 15th century.
