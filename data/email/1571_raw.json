Re the thread on \npapering koshirae, can I solicit some advice on one of my few &quot;attic \nfinds&quot;?  The blade has already been papered (sent back to Japan, \npapered hozon, nice old polish Eisho era unokubi zukuri, but tired).  \nThe koshirae (not sent) has been assessed by One Who Should Know as \noriginal and correct pre-Meiji, absolutely NSW (Not Screwed With).  \nMostly in excellent condition, no wear or soil to the tsuka ito, \neven.  I would guess that papering the koshirae would be a slam dunk, \nexcept\n\n1. The saya is dinged up.  Not terribly badly, but far from \npristine.  It would be a bastard to repair, because in strong light, \nthe &quot;black&quot; lacquer is seen to be black with translucent brown \nstreaks running through it.\n\n2. The kashira is for correct court wear, i.e., it is black horn, not \na kinko match for the fuchi (which is signed, though the apparently \nmatching tsuba isn&#39;t).\n\n3.  Though the tsuba has the hitsu, there are no accessories, and no \nprovisions for any in the saya.\n\nSooooooo, would there be any real point to submitting this to \nshinsa?  It is pre-Meiji original, but no &quot;knock your socks off&quot;.  \nJust wondering, in case a shinsa shows up again on the US west coast \nin my lifetime!\n\nNC  ;o)\n\n\n"
