I- for one - would like to see the eBay image of your recent\n  &gt; acquisition.

Always like brass inlay on good iron!\n  &gt;\n  &gt; To my surprise, I just received what I thought looked like a nice \n  &gt; early iron with\n  &gt; brass inlay tsuba, recently purchased of Ebay, my first Ebay purchase \n  &gt; in ages.\n  &gt; After 40-odd years I thought I had a good &quot;eye&quot; for such things; just \n  &gt; bought a\n  &gt; repro!

Looks like an honest mistake on the seller&#39;s \n  &gt; part, but it\n  &gt; points up the importance of in-hand study. (I think others spotted \n  &gt; this since my\n  &gt; bid was much too low if authentic. Just mentioning this to point out \n  &gt; how good (in\n  &gt; pictures only) these repros are today.\n  &gt;\n  &gt; Enjoyed this topic of lacquer on Heianjo works. I once owned a very \n  &gt; similar (or\n  &gt; same one?) tsuba that was pointed out here.

For a start, most Heianjo (real Heianjo and not \n  &gt; Edo period\n  &gt; copies) are Momoyama period or earlier. They were mainly made just for \n  &gt; a hundred\n  &gt; years or so, basically the 16th century. The earlier pieces are \n  &gt; sometimes called\n  &gt; Onin, but even if you include this group, you still only get the \n  &gt; period around\n  &gt; 1450-1600. That means that they are old. Many were lacquered. Some \n  &gt; were well\n  &gt; preserved some were not. The lacquer is part of the overall gestalt. \n  &gt; If you see a\n  &gt; hundred Heianjo tsuba, 25 or so will be lacquered, of which 5 will be \n  &gt; in excellent\n  &gt; condition, 10 will be decently preserved, 5 will be in need of varying \n  &gt; degrees of\n  &gt; restoration and 5 will be dead.\n  &gt;\n  &gt; Cheers,\n  &gt;\n  &gt; Shirogitsune\n  &gt;\n  &gt; --- On Sun, 7/20/08, bungotakadasword &lt;MuramasaIII@... \n  &gt; &lt;mailto:MuramasaIII%40aol.com&gt;&gt; wrote:\n  &gt;\n  &gt; From: bungotakadasword &lt;MuramasaIII@... \n  &gt; &lt;mailto:MuramasaIII%40aol.com&gt;&gt;\n  &gt; Subject: [nihontostudy] clear lacquer\n  &gt; To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com &lt;mailto:nihontostudy%40yahoogroups.com&gt;\n  &gt; Date: Sunday, July 20, 2008, 1:58 PM\n  &gt;\n  &gt; gang,\n  &gt; last time i mentioned noticing &#39; clear lacquer &quot; on most Heianjo tsuba,\n  &gt; people thought i was smoking some good weeds....... ....\n  &gt;\n  &gt; Typical response was ........... fire scales\n  &gt;\n  &gt; http://www.nihontok anjipages. com/tosogu. com/\n  &gt;\n  &gt; how about that ?\n  &gt;\n  &gt; milt\n  &gt;\n  &gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n  &gt;\n  &gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n  &gt;\n  &gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n  &gt;\n  &gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n  &gt;\n  &gt; \n\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n   \n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
