The rims appear to have been \n&gt; inserted later.\n&gt; The nakago=\r\n-hitsu is surprisingly lacking in any signs of wear?\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards, John L.\n=\r\n&gt;Hello Dr. It was my feeling that they were stylised waves. You may \nbe rig=\r\nht though. J \n&gt; --- In nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com, &quot;sosidore&quot; &lt;sosidore@y=\r\n...&gt; \n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Dear all, \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I have this interesting tsuba po=\r\nsted on Nihontostudy at:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; All Albums  | Photo Albums &gt; Sosidore &gt; I=\r\nron Tsuba Dragon  \n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Anyone well versed in Chinese artifacts knows =\r\nthis tsuba is an \n&gt; &gt; unusual one. I would like to give some clue so that r=\r\neaders of \n&gt; this \n&gt; &gt; message would came up with similar beliefe as I did.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 1. Chinese emperor was the only one who is entitled to put \ndrago=\r\nn \n&gt; &gt; decors on everything he owned. \n&gt; &gt; 2. However dragons could also pu=\r\nt to use as icons by other \npersons \n&gt; or \n&gt; &gt; entities only if the number =\r\nof dragon&#39;s fingers reduced to \neither \n&gt; 4 \n&gt; &gt; or 3. Five fingers claws m=\r\nust not be used in any dragon unless \nthe \n&gt; &gt; owner of that dragon design =\r\nis Chinese emperor himself. \nViolation \n&gt; of \n&gt; &gt; such rule was subject to =\r\ncapital punishment.\n&gt; &gt; 3. There used to be a continued flow of sword impor=\r\nt from Japan \n&gt; &gt; dating back more than a thousand years.\n&gt; &gt; 4. Swords as =\r\npossibly one of the contributions to Chinese \nemperor \n&gt; &gt; during Qing Dyna=\r\nsty would demand unique design for their tsubas. \n&gt; &gt; Guess what design wou=\r\nld it use?\n&gt; &gt; 5. Any contribution to the king would bear no signature of t=\r\nhe \n&gt; &gt; artist. Guess what? This elegant iron tsuba bear no signature on \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; neither side.  \n&gt; &gt; 6. I am in no position to do the authentication on t=\r\nhe style of \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; dragon shown on this tsuba. Somehow its style poise=\r\nd to resemble \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; one shown on Meiji coins. There is strong likelih=\r\nood that this \n&gt; tsuba \n&gt; &gt; was of Japan origin dating back to late 19th ce=\r\nntury.\n&gt; &gt; 7. Guess who is in the position in Japan to offer this tsuba as =\r\n\n&gt; part \n&gt; &gt; of a sword to Chinese emperor then?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I hope you enjoy =\r\nas much as I when pondering the answers to \nthose \n&gt; &gt; questions. You proba=\r\nbly would find some interesting part of \n&gt; details \n&gt; &gt; missing. Readers an=\r\nd I would like to hear them.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Now, it is time that tsuba expert and=\r\n historians take over \n&gt; &gt; authentication processes from here. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Ch=\r\nen, Ying-chaw\n&gt; &gt; Taipei\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n"
