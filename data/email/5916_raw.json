Grey is known to most collectors and is a great guy.\n\nI have 99 tsuba out of the Skip Holbrook collection that I will list on my website this coming weekend. I will begin listing them at 10:30 AM US central daylight time, which is 3:30 PM Greenwich Mean Time, on Sunday, Sept. 23. The 1st tsuba I list will be #H270, and about 20 minutes later I will list the last of the group, H365 (3 daisho sets account for the math discrepancy). I will not give anyone a sneak preview so please don&#39;t ask. I won&#39;t even tell you what schools of tsuba are included; you&#39;ll have to wait till Sunday with everyone else to see what I have.\n    A friend and I have been buying tsuba in bunches from Skip for a few years now, as he thins out his huge collection. As we have progressed through the bunches the quality has steadily increased. This group, which may be the last, is incredible.\n    Hope to hear from you come Sunday.\n \n                                                 Thanks,\n \n                                                    Grey\n\nMy site: http://www.japaneseswordbooksandtsuba.com\n\n    \n\n\n"
