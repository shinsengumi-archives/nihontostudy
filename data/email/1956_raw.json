It\nhas been some time for me to reply because I am quite busy at work. I just\nhope you did not think I was being rude by not replying earlier. Eitherway\nsorry, and I will try and get a reply in sooner in future, since I really\nappreciate the help. Now to the questions:\n\nWhile staying on the topic of Higo Tsuba, I have some queries about the\nHayashi School that was patronized by the Kato, and later the Hosokawa clan.\nI hope you can help. These tsuba seem to have a very &#39;gentlemanly&#39;\nappearence about them, which makes them to my mind very attractive pieces.\n\nOne tsuba I saw described was signed by the second mainline master\nShigemitsu. The commentary said that he must have been over 61 years in age\n(since it was signed), as this had special significance in Japan, and in\nHigo tsuba were only signed after this point in life.\n\nA. What is the significance of turning 61 in Japan &\n\nB. Why wait untill then to sign guards in Higo? Did other schools in Higo do\nthis as well, like the Jingo for example? How about entirely different\nschools outside Higo, did they do this as well or not (doubtful?)\n\nC. Last question(s), since I (again!) have never handled or even seen a\nmainline Hayashi guard in the flesh or come up for sale, can anyone give me\nan indication as to how this would compare value wise to say a mainline\nJingo Tsuba? Would this be similar since they are both Higo, or would it be\ncomparable to say a mainline Akasaka piece? (I am assuming that the pieces\nare in excellent condition).\n\nD. Very last question: If A and B are so important, and we know how\nimportant it is to have signed works for reference, how does this translate\nvalue wise to say perhaps two identical pieces. One signed and one mumei\nwith all other things being equal. What difference are we talking value wise\nhere, if any?\n\nE. I promise this is my last question: If tsuba are signed only later in\nlife (in Higo) might this imply that they are better pieces since the maker\nwas more skilled at that time. Would a later identical tsuba be worth more\nthan an earlier one by the same man (supposing both were signed and dated\nfor arguments sake)?\nIn modern art a discussion has been raging for years about De Koonings work,\nsince it was found out that he had gone quiete senile later in life. This\nled to a revaluation of his works, the earlier ones being worth more, since\nno-one wanted a very expensive painting by someone who was for all intensive\npurposes as Mad as a Hatter. Karel Apples early works are worth more than\nhis later ones as well, albeit for entirely different reasons.\n\nRegards, Matthew\n\n\n    Z Recruiting Services\n    &quot;Zurich Toren&quot; Muzenstraat 89\n    2511 WB Den Haag\n    T: +31 70 4262273\n    F: +31 70 4262111\n    W: zrecruiting.com\n    E: info@...\n    Kijk ook op monsterboard.nl en\n    nationalevacaturebank.nl voor actuele vacatures!\n\n    Z Recruiting Services is een handelsnaam van Zï¿½ta Partners B.V.\n    Onze Algemene Voorwaarden zijn gedeponeerd bij KvK Haaglanden.\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &quot;arnold frenzel&quot; &lt;afrenzel@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;token_kenkyu_kai@...&gt;; &lt;matthewhoyle@...&gt;\nCc: &lt;nihonto@yahoogroups.com&gt;; &lt;nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Sunday, June 20, 2004 3:31 PM\nSubject: Re: [nihontostudy] Jingo Tsuba\n\n\n&gt; Hi:\n&gt;  I will take a stab at your very interesting question, one of many that\n&gt; you seem to come up with. You have provided part of the answer yourself\n&gt; by saying &quot;rare&quot; though of course that begs the question, why rare?\n&gt; Jingo tsuba were made in Higo and the work of the first three\n&gt; generations is considered particularly fine, thereafter as in most lines\n&gt; following generations could not stop adding gold and silver effects,\n&gt; becoming too symmetric, adopting features from other groups, etc.\n&gt;  Higo, being remote from Edo, tended to supply products in the kodogu\n&gt; area, as with swords, that were somewhat outside the mainstream and they\n&gt; tended to be somewhat aloof from fashion elsewhere and to maintain that\n&gt; difference longer than other groups. Their market was more the samurai\n&gt; and less the merchant than would be true for people supplying the market\n&gt; in Edo and Osaka. The first three developed naturalistic designs never\n&gt; seen before or since, and thereby reflected the wabi sabi aesthetic that\n&gt; was very influential, particularly with the more severe samurai in the\n&gt; early Edo period. Their designs are very three dimensional, tastefully\n&gt; accented with gold and silver. Their most complementary counterpart\n&gt; seems to be found in the work of the Kanayama which, while sukashi, have\n&gt; the same rustic, subtle and unpretentious character. People also wonder\n&gt; whey they tend to go for some serious money. Jingo tsuba are instantly\n&gt; recognizable and fit well with any severe koshirae.\n&gt;  Just a stab.\n&gt;  Arnold\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; matthewhoyle@... 06/19/04 7:49 PM &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; Can anyone explain why Jingo tsuba are so sought after? They always\n&gt; strike me as being a bit crude and not very interesting, often decorated\n&gt; with an eagle or other beast that looks, well, kind of retarded. Is\n&gt; there any specific reason why these pieces have the status they do?\n&gt; After spending hours looking at pictures of them, I still fail to see\n&gt; where the (artistic) merit is.\n&gt;\n&gt; I admit to not having handled any genuine examples personally (since\n&gt; they are pretty rare), so perhaps these tsuba convey something in the\n&gt; handling that they do not in the pix?\n&gt;\n&gt; Matt\n&gt;\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
