What type?  I don&#39;t have any of my &quot;film&quot; \npics up, but I found it great for shooting\nhada because it as a much wider dynamic range than my 10D - I actually \nrecently picked up a\nBronica GS-1 for doing overall sword pics, but I haven&#39;t gotten a chance \nto try it with the 65mm\nlens I also recently acquired, just to do sword pics (takes amazing \nlandscape pics though :-)  - and you can pick up medium format\nstuff for a song these days  bwahaha....)  Film still has its uses :-) \n But I digress...   What kind of problems\nare you having anyway?\n\nYou might try finding the Hunter and Fuqua book sooner than later - its \nReal Helpful in aiding you\nto visualize what&#39;s going on...\n\nGood Luck,\n\nrkg\n(Richard George)\n\n&gt;Many thanks,\n&gt;\n&gt;Particularly to Richard and Barry.\n&gt;\n&gt;Great fotos Richard (I&#39;m really jealous). I have probably shot more rolls \n&gt;of film than most but to date, this subject matter has got the better of \n&gt;me. I&#39;ll take your advice and read the articles and if I get anywhere, I&#39;ll \n&gt;post something.\n&gt;\n&gt;Once again thanks a lot and best wishes\n&gt;\n&gt;Roger\n&gt;\n&gt;(Apologies if you got this twice but it seemed to fail the first time)\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;Yahoo!
