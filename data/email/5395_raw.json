I&#39;m talking about the design being made by carving the plate surface away. The tsuba I&#39;m looking at has been posted under photos...\n\n  http://tinyurl.com/2jq42a\n\n  and shows a 24-petal kiku sukashi where the petals are rounded down below the surface of the rim and overall plate. (In this case, the tsuba is actually tapered, the flat edge being 1 mm less than the seppa-dai surface.) In the Boston book Ogawa called this sukidashi takabori in the Hayne/Harvie study book it seems to be called horiage (if I&#39;m understanding the description correction) and also another term which I can&#39;t find right now. \n\n  Is there a common name for this type of sunken relief carving? \n\n  Ron\n  STL\n\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n   \n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
