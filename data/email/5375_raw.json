Blade signed with three characters MINAMOTO SADASUKE.  There are SADASUKE listed as working in both Koto and Shinto period in different areas of Japan:\n\nShimada school Koto: \nSuruga province, 1501 1st generation\n      &quot;          &quot;        1558 2nd generatiom\nShimada school Shinto:\nSuruga province, 1624 1st generation\n      &quot;          &quot;        1661-1684 2nd generation\nSadahiro school Koto:\nSoshu province, 1469-89 (may not be Sadahiro school)\n    &quot;            &quot;       1542 1st generation\n    &quot;            &quot;       1573 2nd generation\n\nThen there are the &quot;orphans&quot;:\nSadasuke, Owari 1688 (2 character signature)\nSadasuke, Iwashiro 1688.\n\n(Above information is from Willis Hawley&#39;s Big Brown Book)\n\nSo, Eduardo, as Peter Bleed and John Stuart have commented, it is very good looking sword with no comparable oshigata &quot;in the books&quot;.  From looking at your pictures to me the sword reeks of quality.  Peter has noted the tsuba.  I particularly note the habaki and seppa as being of exceptional workmanship, being gold foil over (I&#39;m guessing) copper.  The habaki is just beautiful and of the niju type (two pieces).  The best part Eduardo is the condition - this wakizashi is a beautiful collector&#39;s piece.  Oh, the tang is very original with the two holes.  I&#39;m sure the second hole near the tip of the tang is original, if unusual in a wakizashi - it&#39;s more usually seen in meatier katana.\n\nI&#39;ve just catalogued 62 Japanese swords for an auction, many of them wakizashi, and NONE were in the condition that &quot;your&quot; sword is.  None!!  This is a sword to be proud of and I&#39;m sure the smith is in a book somewhere.  I&#39;ll check in a set that a friend has and report back.\n\nBest regards\nBarry Thomas\n(Melbourne, Australia)\n\nPS - I see Gordon has identified your blade.  Congrats again.\n\n\n\n\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: Eduardo \n  To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Friday, March 21, 2008 6:23 AM\n  Subject: [nihontostudy] A nice Waki in Argentina\n\n\n  Hi Group\n  Can you help me with this waki?\n  Many people told me that it is 1661, but another one who told me that \n  it was much more modern.\n  According to the marks on the nakago, we will know about it when? \n\n  Another question: \n  It&#39;s about the second mekugi ana ... \n  It will be a shortened Katana? And signed again in the nakago? \n  Thank you and excuse my mishandling of the English language \n  Regards\n  Eduardo\n\n  http://i68.photobucket.com/albums/i32/Ricazzo_fotos/112.jpg\n  http://i68.photobucket.com/albums/i32/Ricazzo_fotos/108.jpg\n  http://i68.photobucket.com/albums/i32/Ricazzo_fotos/107.jpg\n  http://i68.photobucket.com/albums/i32/Ricazzo_fotos/106.jpg\n  http://i68.photobucket.com/albums/i32/Ricazzo_fotos/105.jpg\n  http://i68.photobucket.com/albums/i32/Ricazzo_fotos/103.jpg\n  http://i68.photobucket.com/albums/i32/Ricazzo_fotos/102.jpg\n  http://i68.photobucket.com/albums/i32/Ricazzo_fotos/101.jpg\n  http://i68.photobucket.com/albums/i32/Ricazzo_fotos/4.jpg\n\n\n\n   \n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
