I believe I also \nremember reading that thi=\r\ns extended all the way to the standardization of the hitsuana of \ntsuba, am=\r\nong other things...  I&#39;m wondering whether any of you far more knowledgeabl=\r\ne \nthan me might confirm this, and would also be able to supply an approxim=\r\nate date when \nsuch edicts were handed down.  \n\nWhat I&#39;m curious about is t=\r\nhis:  how possible might it be to (in part) determine whether or \nnot a par=\r\nticular tsuba was made in the early Tokugawa Period vs. the late Momoyama \n=\r\nbased (in part) on the passing of this law?  I&#39;m thinking here that if a ce=\r\nrtain tsuba \npossesses idiosyncratic hitsuana (or other non-standard featur=\r\nes), would this allow a more \nconfident dating to an earlier time (again, a=\r\ns part of the assessment process)?  Or are \nthere many variables (including=\r\n lax enforcement of such &quot;laws&quot;) which would render this \nline of thought e=\r\nssentially useless?  I think about such departures as Shimizu Jingo \n(shoda=\r\ni) and think that maybe this isn&#39;t a very good barometer...!  Anyway, just =\r\nthinking \nout loud here.  Your thoughts appreciated...\n\nSteven\n\n\n\n\n"
