Further, while it has some very skillfully applied sekigane of the same hue (presumably applied at the same time); the exterior work as with your tsuba has received additional treatment.  It has been finished in black only to its interior edge so as to be indiscernible when mounted.\n\nWhen shown to Jim Gilbert he offered that it may have been a restoration after being modified for a western-styled retaining clip.  But again, this was only one of the possibilities.\n\nWhat is clear is that great care was give to add this feature and it was skillfully applied.\n\nI should like to hear what others have to say on the subject and will post a picture if anyone is interested.  Perhaps Jim remembers the guard that I am describing and can comment further.\n\n\nHappy Holidays, \n\nMichael Harris \n\nhttp://www.satcho.com  Specialists in books related to the study & appreciation of the Japanese sword as art. \n\nThe Nihonto Calendar http://nihontocalendar.org  A calendar of Japanese sword club meetings and events around the world that may be set as your home page.

Really nice old \n&gt;iron, the pics don&#39;t do it justice, I will try for\n&gt;better ones soon.\n&gt;\n&gt;Question, the little plate of Shakudo on the upper\n&gt;right hand side of \n&gt;the seppa dai in photo 1, what purpose would this\n&gt;serve.\n&gt;\n&gt;Cheers\n&gt;\n&gt;Rich\n&gt;\n&gt;http://members.westnet.com.au/whiz/richard/pics/tsu\n&gt;ba/Kyo-shoami-front.jpg\n&gt;\n&gt;http://members.westnet.com.au/whiz/richard/pics/tsu\n&gt;ba/Kyo-shoami-back.jpg\n&gt;\n&gt;http://members.westnet.com.au/whiz/richard/pics/tsu\n&gt;ba/Kyo-shoami-detail.jpg\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;[Non-text portions of this message have been\n&gt;removed]\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;Yahoo!
