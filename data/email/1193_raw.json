The\ncollective knowledge in this group is amazing.\n\nThis leads me to my question.  Well, first a little background.  I&#39;m\ncurrently working on my MA in Art History at LSU.  My thesis work is on\ncross-cultural currents of martial arts in the global community.  As a bit\nof side research, I&#39;ve been studying sword mounts, especially those of\nJapanese origin.  I&#39;m aware that the steel sword is introduced to Japan\nfrom China sometime pre-Nara.  I&#39;m also fairly up to speed on the\ntransformation of the sword from the Chinese design to one that is purely\nJapanese.\n\nNow, what I&#39;m trying to determine is if there is any evidence of the\nJapanese style mounts ever being made in China (or SE Asia, Phillipines,\netc) prior to the modern age.  If any of you could point me in the right\ndirection, I&#39;d be most grateful.\n\nThanks,\n\nBuddy Ethridge\nExhibitions Coordinator\nLSU Libraries\n\n\n"
