There are very few=\r\n \ndealers that one must be careful of. Asking a lot of questions, \ngetting =\r\na lot of opinions is critical for my survival along with the \nother &#39;newbee=\r\ns&#39;. But, the dealer that sold me this piece (19 & 20 \nphotos)was not honest=\r\n with me. I ask the right questions and got \nincorrect answers. As I said, =\r\n&quot;I have learned from this experiance.&quot; \n\nThe Saotome has a Shakudo rim.\n\nTh=\r\nank you very much,\n\nElliott\n\nPS; I admit making an ass out of myself someti=\r\nmes.....I hate when \nthat happens. \n\n\n--- In nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com, =\r\nCurran Campbell \n&lt;neobliviscar@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Elliott,\n&gt; \n&gt; No matter how =\r\nhard we may try, I think all of us make\n&gt; an ass of ourselves at one time o=\r\nr another. I\n&gt; certainly have. By sticking my neck out and giving an\n&gt; opin=\r\nion here, I&#39;ve probably just ticked off a dealer\n&gt; who now is going to send=\r\n evil thoughts my way.\n&gt; \n&gt; There are a lot of dealers out there who are ve=\r\nry\n&gt; honest and take small profit for their pains. Do them\n&gt; credit.\n&gt;    L=\r\nordy knows it pains me to go through the process\n&gt; of selling anything. Abs=\r\nolutely hate to even try! This\n&gt; past year I picked up 2 lots of exceptiona=\r\nlly good\n&gt; tsuba and am only going to keep about 40% of them. I&#39;m\n&gt; in the =\r\nprocess of papering them (slow process)and\n&gt; deciding which to keep. I plan=\r\nned to let an auction\n&gt; house sell them, but learned the auction houses get=\r\n\n&gt; their pound of flesh! Unless I give them over $100,000\n&gt; of items... the=\r\ny take a greater % than any dealer I\n&gt; know.\n&gt;     As the tsuba come back f=\r\nrom Japan, I&#39;ll just put\n&gt; them out at Tampa sword show and possibly Chicag=\r\no--\n&gt; but ultimately a few of them will probably end up with\n&gt; a dealer.\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; So go easy on the dealers. Many are good people who\n&gt; provide a service =\r\nto buyers and sellers. There are 2\n&gt; or 3 I call friend.\n&gt; \n&gt; Curran\n&gt; \n&gt; P=\r\ns.

And it only hurts a little.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; I bought this tsuba and another from one of the many\n&gt; &gt; &#39;dealers&#39; w=\r\nho \n&gt; &gt; spout their so-called knowledge of Nihonto but don&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; know their=\r\n ass \n&gt; &gt; from a hole-in-the-ground (and who will remain\n&gt; &gt; nameless). I l=\r\nearned \n&gt; &gt; a very good lesson..........Be very careful about\n&gt; &gt; what you =\r\nare being \n&gt; &gt; sold and how much money your spending. Since they\n&gt; &gt; didn&#39;t=\r\n cost me \n&gt; &gt; alot, this lesson was worth the money. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; As soon as I=\r\n take some pictures of the other, I will\n&gt; &gt; submit them for \n&gt; &gt; a consult=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The Saotome piece I have in my album is fabulous.
