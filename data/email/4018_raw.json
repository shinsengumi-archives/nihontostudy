Compared to earlier sukashi and ita tsuba though, it is heavy.  Nobuie was probably the first to make heavier guards, but I&#39;d have to think about that a bit more.\n\nRegarding Owari iron, go back through the previous kantei two albums and as a group consider the metal, hammer work, tekkotsu and &quot;melted&quot; finish.  These are all typical of early Owari area work.  Also this album about tekkotsu\nhttp://ph.groups.yahoo.com/group/nihontostudy/photos/browse/d4b0 are all Owari region.\n\nBy comparison Kyoto iron has a softer look to it, more homogenous, shows less modulation in the hammering, generally does not show prominent tekkotsu or a melted finish (although some Ko-Shoami will have this).  Some would say more refined, others would say more boring.  Think Kyo-sukashi, Heianjo, Onin, Kaneie, etc.  Usually it is more of a brown color rather than blue-black of Owari (all caveats about color in effect).\n\nIt&#39;s probably not possible to explain without examples in hand, but try to look carefully at the photos.  Even with examples in hand it takes some years of effort to see.\n\nJim\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: steven \n  To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Sunday, March 19, 2006 9:31 PM\n  Subject: [nihontostudy] Re: tsuba kantei 3 setsumei\n\n\n  Marvelous tsuba, Jim.  I hadn&#39;t realized the piece was so large.  It must be very heavy.  \n  Fascinating details regarding the hitsuana, as well.  I&#39;d like to ask if you could elaborate a \n  bit on what is meant by &quot;Owari iron.&quot;  Exactly what gives it away when one identifies a \n  particular tsuba&#39;s iron as &quot;clearly Owari&quot;...?  Thanks again, Jim, for another great Kantei.  \n  Already looking forward to another...\n\n  Steven\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
