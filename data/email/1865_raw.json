Basically a sense of &#39;swirling motion&#39;\nwith paulownia flowers. It is one of my better tsubas\nand I believe it to be probably 3rd generation or\naround that time, though Jim G. has seen it and can\ncorrect me.\n   Since the central design element is so close, I&#39;ll\ntry and photograph & post it for\ncomparison/discussion.\n\nHow thick is it at center? Does it thin out a mm or\n2mm by the mimi?\n\nCurran\n\n\n\n--- Richard Turner &lt;ikkanshi@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; All, a new purchase. An Akasaka ( mumei ) guard in\n&gt; Higo style.
