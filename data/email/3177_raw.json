I don&#39;t think that it is possible to attribute them to a specific group.  At shinsa work like this is often described as Kyo-Kanagushi (Kyoto metal fittings maker). \n\nJim\n\n\n\n  Hi all,\n  I recently made an offer on a set of menuki on eBay, and got them. I&#39;m\n  not a fittings guy at all, but wanted a nice pair for a future\n  mounting project, and as an example for study.\n  They were described as Goto or at least waki-goto. I doubt they are \n  Goto...but am wondering if anyone has any thoughts on the quality,\n  school etc? Are there any identifying marks on menuki that might lead\n  towards a certain school?\n  Was really attracted to them because of the fine carving work, and\n  detail. The colour is a nice dark brownish-black shakudo, not like the\n  lighting in the photo shows.\n  They are actually nicer than in the pics..with some very fine carving,\n  and detail on the toes, ribs, tail etc. Some odd marks on the\n  legs..which are 2 ovals with a small dot in the middle.\n  Middle to late edo I assume? Condition is very good. Any comments from\n  &quot;menuki guys&quot; appreciated.\n\n  Pic is at\n  http://www.image-hosting.net/images/messageboard/retalt/Menuki.jpg\n\n  Thanks,\n  Brian \n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
