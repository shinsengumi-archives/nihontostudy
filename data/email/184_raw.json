He is carrying an uchigatana with a tsuba, however it&#39;s rather difficult to say whether it might be made of iron, yamagane or leather.\n\nGordon - do you have any sort of image of the nagamaki tsuba?  Is it a plain iron plate without sukashi?\n\nJim\n\n\n\n  Hi Richard,\n\n  The fuchi-kashira are MIno in style. Can&#39;t tell much about the menuki or the\n  tsuba, which appears to be iron. Kozuka is also difficult to tell much\n  about. Unfortunately, when my daughter was home the last time with her\n  boyfriend, they switched my internet connnection to Opera, which only reads\n  English, so I can&#39;t read the Japanese text.\n  On a slightly different note getting back to the use of Ko-Tosho and\n  Ko-Katchushi tsuba, I had mentioned Sasano&#39;s ideas about this. This morning\n  I took another look at his book Tosogu no Kigen or Origins of Sword Fittings\n  (actually, Katana Fittings). One of the illustrations he cites is the Ban\n  Daiagon scroll, which shows an elderly foot solider with an uchigatana that\n  has a tsuba. This scroll dates to the late Heian period. There are other\n  warriors with shorter blades -- koshigatana? -- that are without tsuba.\n  There is also a plain round iron tsuba that would be called a Ko-Tosho that\n  was mounted on a nagamaki. We know this because the seppa were rusted to the\n  tsuba and they are large and round of the type that would be for a nagamaki\n  handle. The tsuba is very large at 9.3 cent. across. Anyway, just thought I\n  would share this.\n\n  Gordon\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
