The shape does not seem to be highly compromised and we\nhave all seen blades in far worse condition come thru polish to be\nbeautiful. Before you decide to commit to a polish, however, I think I will\nnot be the only one to urge you to move slowly.\nFirst, I&#39;d try to do a bit of kantei. This sure does not look like a\nshin-shinto to me. If it is as new as you think, then somebody has\nfalsified the nakago in ways that would make it hard for me to ever &quot;like&quot;\nthis blade. Its been dummied up and no matter how well it comes thru\npolish, after a while I suspect that the tang will become hard to over\nlook. In fact, I bet this is a koto that deserves to be brought back.\nSecondly, the fact that you cannot see a hamon has to be investigated. A\nyakiba will typically show even when a blade is in wretched condition. If\nyou can&#39;t see anything - even tho you look hard - I think you have to\nassume that the blade has &quot;lost its temper.&quot; In that case, a polish would\nbe a total waste of your time and money. The good news is that I think your\nimages DO show a tempered edge. Again, I think the blade deserves\nrestoration. To be sure, tho, I suggest that this is a prime candidate for\nhaving a window opened to be sure that it is intact.\nGood luck\nPeter Bleed\n\n\n"
