Next, the squareness of the sukashi cut, much like Akasaka \nwork where the walls of the Sukashi are very straight. As for the iron \nitself, it has a somewhat soft look to it, and the thickness is typical \nof this group as is the Maru Gata. I have found no reference to tekkotsu \nin this group yet so I cannot make a judgement on that either way. All \nthese things lead me to my judgement of ONO.\n\nWhen I first looked at this tsuba, both Ono and Yagyu popped into my \nmind. One thing I found when looking into this group is that they based \nthere work style on both Yagyu and Kanayama styles.\n\nKind regards\n\nRich Turner\n\n\n-- \n*Richard Turner - Nihonto Message Board*\n/for the discussion of all things Nihonto./\nwww.nihontomessageboard.com &lt;http://www.nihontomessageboard.com/nmb/&gt;\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
