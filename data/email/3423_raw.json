The\ncharacters are neither well-cut nor well-balanced, IMHO.  To me this looks like\na Shinshinto crapper with red lacquer in the kanji!!!   IMHO the kanji are not\nwell carved, as I said, and the whole thing reeks of a tourist trap to me!!!  At\nbest it is a genuine Boshin War piece, but the quality doesn&#39;t strike me from\nthese pics as anything marvellous.  See the two ware evident in the picture, for\nexample.  Also, the hamon looks weak.  It is always better to have a sword &quot;in\nthe hand&quot;, but as opinions are being sought on the basis of the pictures I have\ngiven the best opinion I&#39;m capable of.  It would have been helpful to see the\nnakago and boshi as well to augment &quot;the story&quot; as we need to see a sword in its\ntotality, and not just a &quot;selected slice&quot;...  Oh, congratulations to whoever\nstitched the images together.  Nice job.\n\nBest regards,\n\nBarry Thomas.\n\n\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &quot;sigp210&quot; &lt;sigp210@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Sunday, October 23, 2005 9:04 PM\nSubject: [nihontostudy] Katana/nagamaki with naginata-hi and blade inscriptiion\n\n\nHi All,\nPardon the cross posting on the forums, but I am looking for info on a\nrather unusual sword.\nA friend has owned this sword for many years that I quite fancy. Very\nlong nagasa, and appears to be o-surige. Has an o-kissaki, and well\ncut naginata-type hi. Nakago looks to be around shinshinto period, but\njust my novice opinion.\nWhat is odd about the sword (apart from the fact that it looks like a\nnagamaki blade made into a katana) is the inscription on the blade on\nboth sides.\n\n"
