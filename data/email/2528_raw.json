Even \naccepti=\r\nng the redundant definition of Namban tsuba as being &#39;work \nexhibiting fore=\r\nign influences&#39;,I am unable to reconise any foreign - \neven Chinese - influ=\r\nences on this guard.  Even were such influences \nbe present, it would surel=\r\ny qualify as Hizen rather than as Namban \nwork? \n\nMy impression, although I=\r\n would hate to have to present a reasoned \nargument for it, is rather of Mi=\r\nochin work.  Is this an acceptable \nlabel?\n\nRegards, John L.\n\n\n--- In nihon=\r\ntostudy@yahoogroups.com, Richard Turner &lt;ikkanshi@w...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; Thanks Ji=\r\nm, interesting thought&#39;s, I had not looked at it with the \n&gt; thought of the=\r\n plug not being there. I will try that tonight. \nWelcome \n&gt; back and happy =\r\nnew year to you and the family.\n&gt; \n&gt; another few for interest, the first on=\r\ne, I have been getting \nindications \n&gt; this is Namban maybe, I have no idea=\r\n hat the symbols are though \nBarry \n&gt; Thomas says he has an almost identica=\r\nl tsuba catalogued in a book \nfrom \n&gt; the early 1900&#39;s he is going to dig o=\r\nut for me.\n&gt; \n&gt; Namban ?\n&gt; http://members.westnet.com.au/whiz/richard/tsuba=\r\n/symbol-tsuba-\nfront.jpg\n&gt; http://members.westnet.com.au/whiz/richard/tsuba=\r\n/symbol-tsuba-\nback.jpg\n&gt; \n&gt; Akasaka.

Dr. Robson tells me there is an exact same \ntsuba =\r\nin \n&gt; the book Mito katana to Tosogu no Meihin and thinks whilst the mei \ni=\r\ns a \n&gt; little different, it could be the shodai or one of the students. I \n=\r\nam \n&gt; waiting to here if anyone has a copy of this or in fact, how much \nth=\r\nis \n&gt; book is.\n&gt; http://members.westnet.com.au/whiz/richard/tsuba/tomoyoshi=\r\n.jpg\n&gt; http://members.westnet.com.au/whiz/richard/tsuba/tomoyoshi-mei.jpg\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; thanks for the band width.\n&gt; \n&gt; Rich\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Richard Turner\n&gt; Nihont=\r\n=F4 Message Board\n&gt; &lt;http://members5.boardhost.com/Nihon-To/&gt;\n&gt; - /for the =\r\ndiscussion and sharing of all things Nihont=F4/\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Jim Gilbe=\r\nrt wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Rich,\n&gt; &gt; Pieces like that seem to have been used to chang=\r\ne the shape of \nthe \n&gt; &gt; seppa dai to accommodate a certain shape and/or si=\r\nze of saya and \n&gt; &gt; tsuka.  There are tsuba where the seppa dai has been en=\r\nlarged by \n&gt; &gt; fitting pieces all of the way around.  Sometimes various pie=\r\nces \n&gt; &gt; (including the more common hitsuana plugs) are inserted by a \nlate=\r\nr \n&gt; &gt; collector to restore the look of the guard to something like \nwhat h=\r\ne \n&gt; &gt; believes to be its original state.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I could imagine a piece l=\r\nike being inserted to repair damage if \nit \n&gt; &gt; were somewhere else on the =\r\nguard.  It&#39;s hard to imagine how that \n&gt; &gt; particular spot would be damaged=\r\n. \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I have seen a fair number of tsuba that have a pronounced \nasymm=\r\netry to \n&gt; &gt; the shape of the seppa dai in that location.  There is \nmetal =\r\n&quot;missing&quot; \n&gt; &gt; from the same position at the upper right.  My guess is that=\r\n at \nsome \n&gt; &gt; time and/or place a slightly asymmetrical tsuka or saya shap=\r\ne \nwas in \n&gt; &gt; style and that tsuba were either made or modified to accommo=\r\ndate \nthat \n&gt; &gt; shape.  I haven&#39;t come across such a koshirae and not being=\r\n a \nsword \n&gt; &gt; user I can&#39;t guess as to why such a shape might be desirable=\r\n. \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The insert on your guard might be an attempt to change one of \nt=\r\nhese \n&gt; &gt; tsuba to the more common symmetrical oval shape.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Any othe=\r\nr ideas?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Jim\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message=\r\n have been removed]\n\n\n\n\n"
