Akasaka would fit, as would Tosa Myochin. I notice there is \nno car=\r\nving in the hira ( surface ) usually the tea whisks ( 3 and 9 \no&#39;clock ) ha=\r\nve the brush ( whisk ) lines carved in them and the Ginger \nleaves ( 12 and=\r\n 6 o&#39;clock ) have usually 3 dots ( see this image \nhttp://www.nihontomessag=\r\neboard.com/tsuba_collection/akasaka_tadatoki_tea.jpg \n)\nand 3 lines on them=\r\n as well. The surface does not look like Akasaka \nplate to me, I may be wro=\r\nng, it&#39;s quite rough and pitted up close. It \ncould point to a late student=\r\ns work I guess, or a late copy, none the \nless, I think it is a late tsuba,=\r\n as in the end of the Edo period sometime.\n\nJust some ramblings LOL, they m=\r\nay be all wrong.\n\nRich\n\n\n\nFredrik Persson wrote:\n\n&gt;Hi all,\n&gt;I would like to=\r\n have some help kantei this tsuba.
