If and when private ownership of most firearms is prohibited, it will only be a short time (as the case of Australia demonstrates) before the same policies are extended to other collectable weapons, including Nihonto.  \n\nObviously, complete political mobilization of every single Nihonto collector in the United States would produce no effective result.  That constituency is far too small to have any significant influence.  The real battle will be fought and decided over gun control.  Japanese swords will  be only a small regulatory afterthought. Nihonto collectors need to reflect, and realize that the NRA is even now fighting their fight too.  Every Japanese sword owner should join and support the NRA, and I would suggest that the sword dealing community give serious thought to subscribing to that 1% to the NRA program.\n\nwww.nra.org\n\n\nDavid Zincavage\nLife Member, NRA \n\n\n\n\n\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: Gordon Robson \n  To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Monday, September 01, 2003 4:24 PM\n  Subject: Re: [nihontostudy] FW: Regulatory Impact Statement on proposed Regulations (Ozzland sword ban!)\n\n\n  I should get one too. I note that the reply&#39;s author seems to think \n  that a Japanese art sword potentially worth tens or hundreds of \n  thousands of dollars is a dangerous weapon that needs to be locked up. \n  In the past 20 or so years in Victoria, how many attacks with katana \n  have been recorded? How many with kitchen knives? Perhaps these should \n  be locked up too. Sounds like government regulators running amuck.\n\n  Gordon\n\n  On 2003.9.1, at 03:13  PM, David Zincavage wrote:\n\n  &gt; I will bet that I receive this very same letter shortly.\n  &gt;   ----- Original Message -----\n  &gt;   From: Matthew E.

The lawful use and possession of a &quot;prohibited\n  &gt;   weapon&quot; requires an Approval from the Chief Commissioner of Police \n  &gt; (for\n  &gt;   which a fee is charged). Persons may be exempted from this \n  &gt; requirement\n  &gt;   by the Governor-in-Council. A person, therefore, under the proposed\n  &gt;   Regulations, could still lawfully own and possess a sword if, for\n  &gt;   example, they obtained an Approval to do so from the Chief \n  &gt; Commissioner\n  &gt;   of Police.\n  &gt;\n  &gt;   The proposed Regulations will not necessitate destruction of swords. \n  &gt; In\n  &gt;   the event that the proposed Regulations come into operation, persons \n  &gt; in\n  &gt;   possession of a sword who do not obtain an Approval from the Chief\n  &gt;   Commissioner of Police and who do not fall under an exemption \n  &gt; granted by\n  &gt;   the Governor-in-Council could dispose of their weapons through, for\n  &gt;   example, an authorised weapons trader.\n  &gt;\n  &gt;   The Regulatory Impact Statement (RIS) which assesses the impact of \n  &gt; the\n  &gt;   proposed Regulations has been publicly released and I attach a copy \n  &gt; of\n  &gt;   the RIS for your information. Should you wish to make a further\n  &gt;   submission on the proposed Regulations after reading the RIS (the\n  &gt;   proposed Regulations themselves are at Attachment 1 to the RIS) you\n  &gt;   would be most welcome to do so. The closing date for submissions is\n  &gt;   Monday 8 September 2003. Details on how to make a submission can be\n  &gt;   found in the RIS.\n  &gt;\n  &gt;   Further copies of the Regulatory Impact Statement can be accessed on \n  &gt; the\n  &gt;   internet at www.justice.vic.gov.au\n  &gt;\n  &gt;   Thank you for raising your views with the Department of Justice.\n  &gt;\n  &gt;   Yours sincerely\n  &gt;\n  &gt;   Signed\n  &gt;\n  &gt;   Marisa De Cicco\n  &gt;   Director, Justice Policy\n  &gt;\n  &gt;\n  &gt;   (See attached file: Control of Weapons - Firearms Regulatory Impact\n  &gt;   Statement.pdf)\n  &gt;\n  &gt;\n  &gt;\n  &gt;\n  &gt;\n  &gt;\n  &gt;\n  &gt;\n  &gt;\n  &gt;\n  &gt;\n  &gt;\n  &gt;\n  &gt;\n  &gt;\n  &gt;\n  &gt;\n  &gt;\n  &gt;\n  &gt;   _________________________________________\n  &gt;   ***CONFIDENTIAL***\n  &gt;   The information in this message and in any attachments may be\n  &gt;   confidential.
