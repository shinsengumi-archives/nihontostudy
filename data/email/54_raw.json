It might be buried in my Q&A page text.\n\nI have seen a couple of copper or brass plates that appeared to be folded, but I think that&#39;s pretty unusual (and I&#39;m not even sure about those).  I think that the earlier ones were just hammered out into a plate without folding.  Both earlier and later pieces were cast to shape.  Metallurgists can identify casting vs. hammering vs. a combination of the two in copper alloy artifacts by microscopic examination of cross sections.  I&#39;m not aware of any reliable way to tell from just looking at the finished piece.\n\nJim\n  A follow question after reading Jim&#39;s article on\n  &quot;factory plate&quot;, I would assume then that evidence of\n  folding would be one clue to look for in dating a\n  piece (but not the only clue)?  Does this apply to\n  other metals as well such as copper? Thanks.\n\n  Ken \n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
