Similar central design element.\nAlong a timeline, I&#39;d say yours definitely falls\nchronologically between my 2 examples.\n\nTo be honest, I was a little surprised the Waterwheel\nTsuba papered to Akasaka. The photo&#39;s is odd/bad and\nin hand the tsuba is more distinct, with nice iron\nnodules. Iron is very refined, not needing to be so\nheavily reworked as the 3rd gen? tsuba.\n\nThe 3rd gen? tsuba is very thick, and feels it was\nhammered out from from a center mass. Heavy as a\nbrick.\n   From memory, dimensions are 68mm x 65mm x 6.25 mm.\nThins out about .75mm to 1mm to the mimi, with mimi\nthickness greatest closer to design elements.\n\nCurran\n\n\n\n\n--- Richard Turner &lt;ikkanshi@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Hi Curran, thanks for responding. I don&#39;t have it\n&gt; hand as yet, when I do \n&gt; I&#39;ll scan it and measure it properly and post the\n&gt; pics though the \n&gt; measurements I do have are 76 x 76 x 5 mm.\n&gt; \n&gt; Rich\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Curran Campbell wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Rich,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I would agree with you pretty much on every point.\n&gt; &gt; Has that Higo / Akasaka feel to it and iron looks\n&gt; &gt; cleaner, such that I would say mid to later\n&gt; Akasaka.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The central design is very similar to one of the 2\n&gt; &gt; Akasaka tsuba I own (though shape and iron quality\n&gt; are\n&gt; &gt; different). Basically a sense of &#39;swirling motion&#39;\n&gt; &gt; with paulownia flowers. It is one of my better\n&gt; tsubas\n&gt; &gt; and I believe it to be probably 3rd generation or\n&gt; &gt; around that time, though Jim G. has seen it and\n&gt; can\n&gt; &gt; correct me.\n&gt; &gt;    Since the central design element is so close,\n&gt; I&#39;ll\n&gt; &gt; try and photograph & post it for\n&gt; &gt; comparison/discussion.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; How thick is it at center? Does it thin out a mm\n&gt; or\n&gt; &gt; 2mm by the mimi?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Curran\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been\n&gt; removed]\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nWin a $20,000 Career Makeover at Yahoo!
