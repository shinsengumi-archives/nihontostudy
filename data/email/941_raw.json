His approach is probably closest to Sasano&#39;s.\n\nJust an anecdote that comes to mind...  an experience Bob has mentioned a couple of times was a visit with Dr. Torigoye to a shrine in an area of Japan with a lot of old mound (Kofun) burials.  In addition to the swords that had been donated, the shrine had a box of Kofun jidai fittings that had turned up over the years.  Included among these was a kogai that was presumably contemporary with this material.  This was at a time when kogai were considered to be a late invention.  Today there are kogai that are accepted as Heian to Kamakura period.  Dating of early fittings still needs a lot of work.\nJim\n\n\n\n  Hey guys,\n\n  I just got a chance to peruse the set of Haynes catalogs I ordered from \n  Mr. Helm (thanks again Tom!).\n\n  There appears to be a lot of good info in them.  One thing I was curious \n  about was the dating in them - at\n  first glance it looks like perhaps Mr. Haynes was trying to follow \n  Sasano&#39;s &quot;telescoped&quot; dating for fittings.\n  Is this really what&#39;s going on, or are there really that many kamakura \n  era tsuba, kogai, menuki, etc, out there...\n  (I think Jim had implied earlier that Sasano&#39;s students are busily \n  standing back from his dating scale now,\n  and...)\n\n  Thanks,\n\n  rkg\n  (Richard George)\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
