In part, t=\r\nhis had\nbeen due to the lack of a clearly defined categorisation, making\nsy=\r\nstematic attribution of the group difficult and thus preventing\ncoherent st=\r\nudy of the corpus as a whole. Dr John Lissenden uses this\nredefinition as t=\r\nhe starting point in his accessible, creative and\nthoroughly researched stu=\r\ndy of Namban tsuba, for which he was awarded\nthe degree of Master of Arts i=\r\nn East Asian Studies by the University\nof Durham in 2002.\n\nThe author has m=\r\nade good use of the research that has been previously\ndone by European and =\r\nJapanese students, but has also been originally\ncritical of some of the est=\r\nablished scholarship. This approach has\nallowed him to present interpretati=\r\nons of Namban tsuba that are indeed\nnew. Among collectors and curators, som=\r\ne aspects of this study will be\ndebated =97 even contested =97 but the clar=\r\nity of the author&#39;s position\nwill cause them to reconsider some of their or=\r\niginally held beliefs.\n\nCollectors also will value this study because it pr=\r\nesents an\ninnovative categorisation of this previously neglected group of s=\r\nword\nguards, and serves to clarify the diversity and relationships of the\nN=\r\namban style. Including, as it does, expositions on both gilding and\ncasting=\r\n as related to this group of tsuba, the author&#39;s reappraisal\nalso uses the =\r\ndata on sword furniture as a new source of insight and\ninformation on histo=\r\nrical developments in East Asia during the 16th to\n18th centuries.\n\n\n\n\n"
