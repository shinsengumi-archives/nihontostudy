There are tsuba where the seppa dai has been enlarged by fitting pieces all of the way around.  Sometimes various pieces (including the more common hitsuana plugs) are inserted by a later collector to restore the look of the guard to something like what he believes to be its original state.\n\nI could imagine a piece like being inserted to repair damage if it were somewhere else on the guard.  It&#39;s hard to imagine how that particular spot would be damaged.  \n\nI have seen a fair number of tsuba that have a pronounced asymmetry to the shape of the seppa dai in that location.  There is metal &quot;missing&quot; from the same position at the upper right.  My guess is that at some time and/or place a slightly asymmetrical tsuka or saya shape was in style and that tsuba were either made or modified to accommodate that shape.  I haven&#39;t come across such a koshirae and not being a sword user I can&#39;t guess as to why such a shape might be desirable.  \n\nThe insert on your guard might be an attempt to change one of these tsuba to the more common symmetrical oval shape.\n\nAny other ideas?\n\nJim\n\n\n\n  Hi all, I have had a new arrival for Christmas. This is I believe a \n  Kyo-shoami guard from the early to mid 1600&#39;s, in sand iron and \n  depicting Feathers that are used in the Tea Ceremony. Really nice old \n  iron, the pics don&#39;t do it justice, I will try for better ones soon.\n\n  Question, the little plate of Shakudo on the upper right hand side of \n  the seppa dai in photo 1, what purpose would this serve.\n\n  Cheers\n\n  Rich\n\n  http://members.westnet.com.au/whiz/richard/pics/tsuba/Kyo-shoami-front.jpg\n\n  http://members.westnet.com.au/whiz/richard/pics/tsuba/Kyo-shoami-back.jpg\n\n  http://members.westnet.com.au/whiz/richard/pics/tsuba/Kyo-shoami-detail.jpg\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
