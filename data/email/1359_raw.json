For real, high quality Mino (or Goto)\ntsuba the color of the shakudo is pure black without a trace of brown.\nThe carving is very crisp and precise, the nanako perfectly formed and\nthe gold thick with rich color.  Putting a good one next to a lesser one\nmakes the difference much more clear than I can hope to describe.  I\nborrowed two tsuba to do that at the SF show with a few people when we\nwere talking about exactly this topic.\n\nSeeing this one in person would help of course, but I think it falls\nshort.  The somewhat sloppy carving of the insects and plants looks like\nshiiremono work.  I agree that it is much better than the worst of the\nso-called Nagoya-mono.  That said, I have seen a few pieces of this type\nthat I didn&#39;t think were too hot, but got Hozon level attribution to\nlater Mino.  I suppose that there is overlap between the better\nMino-style production work and lesser &quot;genuine&quot; Mino.  There is a chance\nthat Milt&#39;s piece could paper as later Mino (even without free drinks)\nif it&#39;s better than the photo suggests.  I don&#39;t think that it is\nrepresentative of high quality Mino work though.\n\nDoes that make any sense?\n\nJim\n\n  Jim -\n\n  Why do you call this shiiremono? The quality looks a lot\n  better than what I&#39;ve seen of this shiiremono genre?\n  What details of the tsuba say it&#39;s shiiremono?\n\n  Rich S\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n  _____  \n\nYahoo!
