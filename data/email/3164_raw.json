If it ends up blotchy, you =\r\nwould have to look at\nrepatinating the whole piece, leaving it hardly origi=\r\nnal.\n\nOf course the argument can be reasonably made that the lacquer (or\npa=\r\nint, Milt) - being a later add-on - makes it impossible to have the\n&quot;origin=\r\nal&quot; article without some restoration. While there are those who\nbelieve tha=\r\nt all tsuba as we have them today have been messed with and\nshould be taken=\r\n down to bare metal and patinated &quot;as originally\nintended,&quot; they are in the=\r\n minority, and I would question their claim\nto certain knowledge of what wa=\r\ns &quot;originally intended&quot; by the artisan.\n\nWait a few weeks, David, you will =\r\nget a number of more qualified\nopinions in person at the San Francisco Toke=\r\nn Kai.\n\nCraig\n\n\n-- \nCraig Harris\nBooks from and about Asia\nwww.bridgeofdrea=\r\nms.com\n\nOn 7/16/05, Curran Campbell &lt;neobliviscar@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; David=\r\n,\n&gt; \n&gt; I would say yours is later than the ko-umetada.
