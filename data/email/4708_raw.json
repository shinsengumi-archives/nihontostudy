I intend to practice with it. I believe its a \nshinto blade around 1650. I have a colleague who bought and is using a \nKoto blade. She has had a hi put on by a Japanese smith. They did a \nbeautiful job and the few collectira that have seen it have said that it \ndoes not detract from the shape and beauty of the sword..\nSorry.   Enore\n\nElliott wrote:\n&gt; Enore,\n&gt;\n&gt; I am curious.....What kind, age, etc. of Nihonto are you considering \n&gt; for a Bo-hi? Before you have this done, could I possibly interest you \n&gt; in selling the sword? \n&gt;\n&gt; Elliott\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com, &quot;egardonio&quot; &lt;egardon@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;   \n&gt;&gt; Hello everybody, I&#39;m new to this forum so if I make an error please\n&gt;&gt; remember that. Has anybody had the experience, or do you know, of\n&gt;&gt; having a Bo-hi done to a Nihonto?\n&gt;&gt; For example, does one have to send the nihonto to Japan or can the job\n&gt;&gt; be done in North America.\n&gt;&gt; Thanks for any information\n&gt;&gt; Enore\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;     \n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt; Yahoo!
