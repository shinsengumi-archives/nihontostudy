It dimmensions are 7.6 \nx 7.1 x 5cm\n\nRich\n\nJim Gilbert wrote:\n\n&gt; Curran,\n&gt; It&#39;s not unusual to find Ito pieces like this in good condition.  A \n&gt; lot of these tsuba are fairly small, so the seppa dai will look \n&gt; comparatively large.  Of course if Rich tells us it&#39;s 8 cm in \n&gt; diameter, then I agree that there is something strange.  Based on what \n&gt; I can see in the photo it looks like a legitimate Edo period piece.\n&gt; Jim\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   Jim & Rich,\n&gt;\n&gt;   By coincedence I was reading up on the Bushu schools\n&gt;   this morning as I tried to confirm a mei on a Bushu\n&gt;   tsuba smith. I&#39;m not having much luck, so may beg\n&gt;   Jim&#39;s help later.\n&gt;\n&gt;   I looked at your tsuba and thought Bushu Ito. I wanted\n&gt;   to see if I could find similar example in some of the\n&gt;   books I had out. It has some of that richness of 3-D\n&gt;   carving(?) that always makes me wonder &#39;Umetada&#39;.\n&gt;\n&gt;   But this one looks so clean and the metal so dark &\n&gt;   smooth with no gold loss, and a large seppa dai. No\n&gt;   chance its modern or at least post-Edo? Very clean\n&gt;   piece.\n&gt;     \n&gt;   Curran\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
