The myoga and matsukawabishi don&#39;t normally have anything to do with the musashino design.  They&#39;re rather common decorative devices for &quot;making&quot; hitsuana and were probably originally introduced as mon but then became part of the tsuba designer&#39;s vocabulary.\n&gt;\n&gt;You&#39;re probably right about it being Owari.  There are Owari guards with very Akasaka-esq designs that predate Akasaka.  The seppa dai is quite broad at both the top and bottom.  The rim isn&#39;t very rounded.  The texture of the metal and the carving don&#39;t really fit Akasaka.  The hitsuana treatment would be rather unusual for Akasaka.  Looks like a nice guard.\n&gt;\n&gt;Jim  \n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  Seasons greeting. Just back from holidays and arrived home to a new \n&gt;  piece for the collection. I purchased this guard as Ko Akasaka from a \n&gt;  trusted seller in Japan. I believe though that it is Owari. It has \n&gt;  outstanding colour and iron I think and is in wonderful condition. I \n&gt;  would put this as early Edo but happy to be corrected. There is a \n&gt;  similar tsuba listed in the Tsuba Taikan dated to the mid 1400&#39;s. It has \n&gt;  a great masashino theme but I am unsure of the relationship of the \n&gt;  ginger leaves and mon or pine tree as the hitsu ana. I have started to \n&gt;  wonder, as they have straight bars coming from both, if they are both \n&gt;  mon and in fact, war fans meeting on the grassy battle field. Anyway, \n&gt;  that&#39;s just some fanciful thought. Here are some images.\n&gt;\n&gt;  http://www.nihontomessageboard.com/tsuba_collection/owari-masashino.jpg\n&gt;\n&gt;  http://www.nihontomessageboard.com/tsuba_collection/owari-masashino-1.jpg\n&gt;\n&gt;  http://www.nihontomessageboard.com/tsuba_collection/owari-masashino-2.jpg\n&gt;\n&gt;  It also has very fine running tekkotsu in the mimi, a lot like another \n&gt;  Edo Owari guard I have, just not as pronounced. This is the other mimi.\n&gt;\n&gt;  http://www.nihontomessageboard.com/tsuba_collection/owari-mimi.jpg\n&gt;\n&gt;  Any thoughts or comments would be appreciated.\n&gt;\n&gt;  Note: the scan of the new tsuba makes the patina look a little odd, I am \n&gt;  unsure why this is, but it is in tact and very nice.\n&gt;\n&gt;  Kind regards\n&gt;\n&gt;  Rich Turner\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;Yahoo!
