They look quite nice.  I can&#39;t see much of the other\nfittings.  It says that the tsuba is ko-Kinko.\nJim\n\n  Hi all, this site was bought to my attention and I found this Wak. Lovely\nlittle piece but I was particularly struck by the koshirae. I am guessing\nGoto,  I was discussing this with Barry Thomas and his guess was Mino Goto.\nMaybe Jim G could shed some light on it.\n\n  I was also curious about the papers, would they be Seikeido&#39;s own kantei\npapers ?.\n\n  http://www.seikeido.com/seikeido/1kanezumi.htm\n&lt;http://www.seikeido.com/seikeido/1kanezumi.htm&gt; \n\n  The have some excellent tsuba and some wonderful swords. Bob R, have you\nbeen here ?, I would guess so.\n\n  Rich T\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\nYahoo!
