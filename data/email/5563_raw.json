I came to the conclusion a couple of\n&gt;years ago that I can only do a good job selling books at the Chicago show -\n&gt;coming up in just a month - and I&#39;ve put all my efforts into that show and\n&gt;my website.\n&gt;\n&gt;All these books do no good sitting in my stock, so I&#39;ve decided to offer an\n&gt;unprecedented 33% off sale through April 18th. Yes, in many cases, perhaps\n&gt;most, that means I&#39;ll be selling for less than my cost, but I need the space\n&gt;and money, and you need the books.\n&gt;\n&gt;Check my website, www.bridgeofdreams.com, and check back. I printed a\n&gt;listing today of all the sword, sword fitting, and armor books I have which\n&gt;aren&#39;t online, and it&#39;s hundreds. All those books are lined up or already in\n&gt;boxes to haul to the Chicago show, and I&#39;ll be adding them to the website\n&gt;daily, but ask if you are looking for something not listed, or want some\n&gt;recommendations on particular subjects.\n&gt;\n&gt;You can order on the website using Visa/MasterCard/Amex/Discover or PayPal.\n&gt;Your card or account is never charged until I confirm the total including\n&gt;shipping, and I make a point of charging for shipping at my cost. I prefer\n&gt;to ship Priority Mail, but can use other carriers if you prefer. Email me or\n&gt;call if you have questions.\n&gt;\n&gt;Thanks for looking, and I&#39;m hoping to be of service!\n&gt;\n&gt;Craig Harris\n&gt;Bridge of Dreams, LLC\n&gt;Park Ridge, IL USA\n&gt;&lt;mailto:craigharris%40bridgeofdreams.com&gt;craigharris@...\n&gt;o: 847 696-9774\n&gt;c: 847 846-7701\n&gt;\n&gt;[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
