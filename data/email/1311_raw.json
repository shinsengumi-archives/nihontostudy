I&#39;ve posted two pictures in the photo\n&gt; files under \n&gt; Taipan0723 of a Tsuba I have.  I&#39;ve been told the\n&gt; mei reads Umetada.  \n&gt; All of the Umetada School Tsubas I&#39;ve seen pictures\n&gt; of are non-\n&gt; pierced.  Any information on this Tsuba would be\n&gt; greatly appreciated.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks in Advance,\n&gt; Mark\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nFind out what made the Top Yahoo!
