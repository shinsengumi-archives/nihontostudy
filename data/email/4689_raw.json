I would te=\r\nnd to think that were\n&gt; Namban tsuba to have been in fact lost wax cast, th=\r\nis would help\n&gt; explain their general value discount as compared to most si=\r\nmilar\n&gt; hand-chiseled pieces.  \n&gt; \n&gt; NC\n&gt; \n&gt; P.S. - BTW, an email to my per=\r\nsonal account on this topic was halted\n&gt; by my mail server as &quot;spam&quot; and I =\r\ndon&#39;t know how to resurrect it, so\n&gt; if there was anything unique in it, pl=\r\nease post it to this board.  \nThx.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"
