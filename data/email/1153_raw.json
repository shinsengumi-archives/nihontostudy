It is a Malayan \n  knife.  Sometimes they are single and sometimes double edged.  They \n  can be found in the Celebes, Acheen, West Borneo, Sumatra and I am \n  sure Indonesia.  I am certain that this particular blade is a \n  Japanese blade that was modified to fit into this style of mounting.  \n  They Malay are a seafaring people who did business with virtually \n  everyone in SE Asia and the Pacific Isles.  It is entirely possible \n  the blade was traded for, bought or even stolen as pirate booty.  It \n  is an interesting amalgamation of styles!  I have never seen one like \n  this, but I am not surprised considering the trading and pirating \n  skills of the Malay people!\n  &gt; \n  &gt; \n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
