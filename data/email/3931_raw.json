I would like to \nparticipate. =\r\nBy the way my blasted dial up kept me from grabbing a \ncouple of pieces in =\r\nthat last auction. Oh well. John\n\n\n--- In nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com, &quot;kl=\r\nepet33319&quot; &lt;Ppeterdds@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I for one have enjoyed Jim&#39;s kantei(=\r\ns).  I am wondering if the other \n&gt; members concur and if they might like s=\r\nomething like a regular \nkantei, \n&gt; possibly Friday with answer on Sunday? =\r\n Or bi-weekly? Perhaps we \ncould \n&gt; generate a list of those interested in =\r\nsubmitting their treasures \nwith \n&gt; one member being chosen by Jim each wee=\r\nk.  Then that party could \npost a \n&gt; picture with Jim giving his ideas at t=\r\nhe close of the bidding.  That \n&gt; way he&#39;d be on the hot-seat as well (alth=\r\nough I think luke warm in \nhis \n&gt; case at best LOL).  Just some thoughts.\n&gt;=\r\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
