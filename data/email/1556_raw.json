Given my desire for only mantis\nthemed items, I couldn&#39;t decide to mount them or not\n(one day when I do remount a sword or 2).  I came to\nthe conclusion that I enjoy seeing all these items\ngrouped together in my display table and having them\nall together makes them available for quick study.  I\ntherefore decided not to mount them (my mantis items).\n On the other hand I decided when I do remount some\nswords, that I may choose a secondary theme like\nfishing (other passion of mine) to mount in.  I may\nalso just opt for just a shirasaya but have recently\nbeen leaning toward a bit nicer of a display (matching\nfittings, handle wrap, etc).  When I view my items it\nis usually just the swords or just fittings, depends\non my mood.  I also know that I am unique in that I\ncollect 1 theme, although there are many others like\nme out there.  However, if I were to find a sword with\nall mantis fittings,  I would keep it together.  1\ntsuba on a sword would most likely be stripped and\nreplaced with something else, especially if I didn&#39;t\nhave that tsuba school represented.  I wonder if guys\ninto iado/ sword practitioners or musuem guys (Gordon)\nview the whole package ,sword, fittings, saya, etc as\none, while I tend to view it in terms of seperate\nentities.  I&#39;m rambling here so I&#39;ll stop.  It all\ncomes down to Personal preference- no right or wrong.\n\nKen\n\n\n--- Gordon Robson &lt;robsongo@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Although I am sure to take some heat for this, my\n&gt; feelings have always been\n&gt; that mounts belong on swords and not in boxes.\n&gt; However, there are mounts and\n&gt; then there are swords and they should be at the same\n&gt; level if put together.\n&gt; Still, your approach is often taken everywhere,\n&gt; including Japan.\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Gordon\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: Ron Hartmann [mailto:swords@...] \n&gt; Sent: Wednesday, January 21, 2004 2:55 AM\n&gt; To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: Re: [nihontostudy] shinsa question\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Gordon - \n&gt; \n&gt; A personal dilemma. Last March I&#39;ve purchased a\n&gt; beautiful mumei katana with\n&gt; fantastic (really!) horimono. It came with koshirae\n&gt; which had damage. I&#39;ve\n&gt; had the sword put into shirazaya and a tsunagi made\n&gt; for the koshirae with\n&gt; repairs, on-going. Because the tsuka wrapping was\n&gt; literally falling apart,\n&gt; the fuchi/kashira and menuki were removed and\n&gt; therefore, able to be examined\n&gt; in-hand. The menuki are solid gold &quot;dragons&quot; which\n&gt; are super! The\n&gt; fuchi/kashira (mumei) are even more fine and really\n&gt; do cry for shinsa with\n&gt; an eye toward Goto. The kozuka/kogai looked\n&gt; &quot;mainline Goto&quot; but drew\n&gt; (reportedly) a generic &quot;Goto den&quot; call from the\n&gt; NBTHK. \n&gt; \n&gt; My dilemma, should these wonderful fitting be placed\n&gt; back on the sword or be\n&gt; kept seperately and &quot;boxed&quot; for individual\n&gt; preservation and appreciation. I\n&gt; say &quot;dilemma&quot; but in all honesty my choice has been\n&gt; made; they will be boxed\n&gt; for individual in-hand appreciation. So, should I\n&gt; feel bad to have in a\n&gt; sense &quot;destroyed&quot; a koshirae or should I feel good\n&gt; to have discovered these\n&gt; wonderful kodogu. Granted, the koshirae was not\n&gt; truly a (and I hate this\n&gt; expression) &quot;matching&quot; koshirae and was really &quot;put\n&gt; together&quot; by it pre-war\n&gt; owner. Yes, I&#39;ll keep the saya and (unmounted) tsuka\n&gt; together with a tsunagi\n&gt; but it seems such a waste to put these beautiful\n&gt; fitting back on it where\n&gt; they can be damaged (f/k, kozuka/kogai) or hidden\n&gt; under ito (menuki). \n&gt; \n&gt; After saying all this I&#39;m not too sure where I&#39;m\n&gt; going with it, but my point\n&gt; might be that there is a time to &quot;preserve&quot; a\n&gt; koshirae&quot; and a time to not\n&gt; worry about it. \n&gt; \n&gt; Ron\n&gt; STL\n&gt;   ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt;   From: Gordon Robson \n&gt;   To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n&gt;   Sent: Monday, January 19, 2004 8:18 PM\n&gt;   Subject: RE: [nihontostudy] shinsa question\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   I think if you look at museum collections in\n&gt; Japan, the answer is there.\n&gt;   They do not touch anything no matter the\n&gt; condition. If the wrap is coming\n&gt;   off, it is coming off. They may add something to\n&gt; secure menuki and such to\n&gt;   keep them in place - typically thread. The same\n&gt; goes with lacquer, it is\n&gt; not\n&gt;   touched. Thus, the standards for shinsa are the\n&gt; same. I am pretty sure\n&gt; this\n&gt;   is the case with the NBTHK as well. So, what to do\n&gt; to repair something? If\n&gt;   you want to keep the piece original and unaltered,\n&gt; you must have all new\n&gt;   mounts made and you set aside the original pieces.\n&gt; I know this may seem to\n&gt;   be unreasonable, but those are the very high\n&gt; standards that have been\n&gt;   maintained at shinsa and in museums. I think the\n&gt; same holds true for\n&gt; antique\n&gt;   firearms. Re-blued barrels, re-done stocks and\n&gt; what not seriously harm the\n&gt;   value of the piece. Thus, such alterations should\n&gt; not be done lightly.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   Jim, care to comment?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   Gordon\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   -----Original Message-----\n&gt;   From: samurai@...

If you submit a tsuka, then\n&gt; the same will apply as\n&gt;   with\n&gt;   &gt; the NBTHK. Make sure that the tsuka has not been\n&gt; re-wrapped in the last\n&gt;   100\n&gt;   &gt; or so years - that means it is no longer antique\n&gt; and will be bounced.\n&gt;   Entire\n&gt;   &gt; koshirae will be judged based on authenticity\n&gt; and age of all the pieces,\n&gt;   &gt; i.e. nothing replaced, re-wrapped or\n&gt; re-lacquered. Also, if pieces are\n&gt;   &gt; mumei, they will not be attributed. You must\n&gt; submit the pieces\n&gt; separately\n&gt;   &gt; for that. If all or some of the pieces are\n&gt; signed, then they will be\n&gt;   &gt; authenticated. \n&gt; \n&gt;   In the case of damaged koshirae, is this a\n&gt; bouncable offense, in which\n&gt;   case once something is damaged it becomes\n&gt; unpaperable?\n&gt; \n&gt;   - darcy\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;     _____  \n&gt; \n&gt;   Yahoo!
