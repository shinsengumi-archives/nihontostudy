If I understood correctly all iron  \ntosho style tsuba appropriately enough. I would love to see one in  \nperson myself.\n\t\tYour page says; This is a Tosho tsuba with kokuin impressed in a  \ntsuchime-ji by Suishinshi Masahide. Masahides&#39; great contribution to  \nthe world of the Japanese sword is evidenced by one well known fact,  \nand that is that the Shinshinto era begins with the emergence of this  \nvery artist. His strength, his energy are evidenced by his having  \nanswered the demands of the times all the while fostering over 100  \nstudents. He was an extraordinary educator.\n\tIn Token Benkyo Kai first place is Ten (Heaven), second place is Chi  \n(Earth) and third place is &quot;Jin&quot; (Man). With this work Masahide makes  \nreference to that as well as Buddhistic themes. It is thought with  \nthis tsuba Masahide is showing us a miniature universe, his kokuin  \nreading &quot;Niten&quot; is an abbreviation of Nitenji, a guardian deity who  \nis the same as Nichirin (the orb of heaven, the sun).\n\tIn Bunsei Gannen Masahide changed his name to Amahide, one story has  \nit that the &quot;Ama&quot; was granted to him by lord Akimoto, suggesting a  \nlink to the first great swordsmith Amakuni and &quot;lord of swordmakers  \nheaven.&quot;\n\tThe metal is a bit on the hard side but the color and texture are  \nexcellent, this is a rare and well known piece.\n\n\tAt least that is what I think it says...\n-t\n\n"
