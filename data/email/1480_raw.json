I happen to have seen Hagawa-san making &quot;cat\n  scratches&quot; (sorry, I can&#39;t recall what he called them). I have seen him do\n  both gold and silver. I think in both cases, the marks are made with a\n  special tool. It has a series of about 6 sharp teeth on a blade that is\n  curved upward. The tool is pushed on to the surface to be finished in a\n  rocking motion. This is why the marked are denser on one side. Obviously,\n  seeing this done is pure ballet, but it goes extremely fast, like 30\n  seconds to a habaki. The &quot;burr&quot; that Barry mentions is done by burnishing\n  the surface after it has been scratched. In the case of gold, the\n  burnishing tool is itself gold with a carefully maintained rough finish. It\n  had to be cleaned (degreased?) before it was used, but it only took a\n  couple of stokes to finish the surface. After that the tools went back to\n  its neat little saya!\n  Peter Bleed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  Yahoo!
