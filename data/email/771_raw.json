This is the\n&gt; Japanese term for the overlay techniques that places gold or silver \nleaf on\n&gt; steel by rubbing it into/onto very fine cross hatched striations. \nWhen well\n&gt; done it is very beautiful, but often it is either entirely gone or \nsurvives\n&gt; only as traces. Do we know when and where it originated in Japan? \nAnd where\n&gt; else is it practiced?\n&gt; Peter Bleed\n\n\nHi Pete und all,\n\nfunny you are talking about this nunome zogan..........\nplease take a look see at list album  ( milt&#39;s )  or \nklick.........http://tinyurl.com/n77z\n the two Kyo-sukashi tsuba.\nOne has nunome zogan applied/added on later.I deduced it&#39;s a later \napplication as part of the iron has been eroded resulting in lower \nlevel ( sort of like chips ), yet there are nunome zogan intact there.\n\nThe two tsuba has identical design of Kiri mon with scroll. The \ndesign is illustrated in Sasano&#39;s sukashi book.\n\nmilt\n\n\n"
