What \nswords had which tool more commonly, when did they first appear, and \nof course for some, what were they really used for.\n\ni now have several avenues of research to persue.\n\nMan, i am really starting to love this hobby!!  Every answer leasds \nto 10 questions ... and the stuff (the real stuff) is super beautiful.\n\nwill share any new research.\n\ndoug e.\n-- In nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Jim Gilbert&quot; &lt;jggilbert@E...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; Doug,\n&gt; I think that the mundane explanation of the use of the kogai is \nprobably the correct one.  The shaft/point is for arranging hair and \nthe hook at the other end (mimikaki) is for cleaning ears.  The same \nsort of implement exists for women, but often made out of tortoise \nshell or other materials.  I happened to see an extensive display of \nthem at the Tokyo National Museum a couple of years ago.  You can \nstill buy bags of little wooden mimikaki in Japan -- kind of like Q-\ntips, but hard and pointy.\n&gt; \n&gt; The umabari or bashin was apparently used for acupuncture and \nperhaps minor surgery on horses.  I was skeptical of the acupuncture \nidea, but apparently it was done.  Tom Helm had more information on \nthis the last time the topic came up here, so it&#39;d be worth checking \nthe list archives to dig it up.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ve heard several alternative stories on the use of the kogai, but \nnone of them were entirely convincing.  If anyone has good sources, \nevidence or arguments supporting other versions I&#39;d like to hear it.  \nMultiple uses are possible.\n&gt; Jim\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   interesting tools in the saya, but what were they really used \nfor.  \n&gt;   igotten several different thoughts on this and would like to hear \n&gt;   from more voices.\n&gt;   doug e.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
