My description should have said 2.3mm \nthick. Wow, 1.3 mm would be a very thin tsuba, more decorative that \npractical ????. I don&#39;t think there are any bones, I need to take better \npics, when the sun returns I will attempt it. I am also curious about \nthe wheel motif, if it is ?, all the wheel tsuba I have are either \nround, or a round wheel in another shape, but the wheel itself is always \nround. I wonder if this is something else I cannot see.\n\nRich\n\nJohn Berta wrote:\n\n&gt; Hi Rich;\n&gt;\n&gt; Very interesting tsuba.  I do not think I have ever seen one like it.  \n&gt; Not the design or the unusually shaped large kozuka hitsu.  Sort of \n&gt; like some of the early Jingo but different.\n&gt;\n&gt; The shape of the nakago ana is also unusual in that it does not have \n&gt; the shape you would expect to see that would tightly fit a nakago, and \n&gt; I think it would be difficult to fit a seppa without covering the \n&gt; sukashi design.\n&gt;\n&gt; The look of the iron on the plate seems a little coarser and I do not \n&gt; see any of the large bones in the surface of the plate.  Its hard to \n&gt; tell from pictures though.  The hoan tsuba I have handled have been \n&gt; abut 1.2 to 1.3mm thick.\n&gt;\n&gt; Very interesting unusual tsuba.\n&gt;\n&gt; John\n\n\n\n\n"
