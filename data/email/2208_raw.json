Sorry - Papers are a good start,\n&gt; but...\n&gt; \n&gt; I had alluded to Jim&#39;s article about tsuba care - he\n&gt; recommends boiling \n&gt; water, which works\n&gt; pretty well.\n&gt; \n&gt; On paint, I should have been more clear (that&#39;s what\n&gt; I get for typing \n&gt; late at night) - often older\n&gt; tsubas were lacquered - remmnants of old paint on a\n&gt; tsuba should be \n&gt; handled with the greatest\n&gt; care/respect (on really old tsuba you&#39;ll see the\n&gt; paint form this \n&gt; funky/cool amalgum with the surface\n&gt; patina) - you have to proceed carefully (or just\n&gt; leave well enough \n&gt; alone) when you have old\n&gt; paint like that - I had a tosho once I nicknamed\n&gt; &quot;rusty crusty&quot; because \n&gt; there was a fairly thick\n&gt; uncared for patina on it - BUT there was also a fair\n&gt; amount of what \n&gt; appeared to be original\n&gt; lacquer, so I left it well enough alone - while the\n&gt; tsuba would probably \n&gt; have looked a whole\n&gt; lot better/sold for more if I had just attacked it a\n&gt; little with the \n&gt; ivory/rubbing, it didn&#39;t seem\n&gt; right since it would have nuked the lacquer as\n&gt; well...  The real answer \n&gt; is experience...  You need\n&gt; to go and look at and study (and take good pictures\n&gt; of if you&#39;re \n&gt; motivated) a bunch of good tsuba...\n&gt; \n&gt; On &quot;primped&quot; tsuba, an amazing number of tsuba in\n&gt; the US appear to have \n&gt; gotten the &quot;treatment&quot; -\n&gt; I&#39;ve pretty much stopped buying pieces from people\n&gt; in the US who I don&#39;t \n&gt; know because of this -\n&gt; I&#39;ve been burned enough so I can usually recognize\n&gt; its been jacked with, \n&gt; but I get tired of sending\n&gt; pieces back - but you&#39;ll even get stuff from Japan\n&gt; occasionally that has \n&gt; been &quot;helped&quot;...  (comments\n&gt; about how many people don&#39;t seem to understand white\n&gt; balance on digital \n&gt; cameras deleted).\n&gt; \n&gt; Gotta run,\n&gt; \n&gt; rkg\n&gt; (Richard George)\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;Hi Richard,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Thank you for your excellent words of wisdom.  I\n&gt; think the \n&gt; &gt;message I&#39;m getting is:  just leave well enough\n&gt; alone!  So I \n&gt; &gt;believe I will...  :o).  \n&gt; &gt;One thing, though:  for rookies like me, how would\n&gt; you suggest \n&gt; &gt;being able to spot the oiled, waxed, or (gulp)\n&gt; painted tsuba that \n&gt; &gt;may deceive me?  I certainly hear what you&#39;re\n&gt; saying, and want \n&gt; &gt;to heed your words.  But how, exactly, can I know\n&gt; it when I see it?  \n&gt; &gt;I don&#39;t believe any of the pieces I&#39;ve acquired\n&gt; thus far have been \n&gt; &gt;tampered with this way, but I guess I can&#39;t really\n&gt; be sure (I have \n&gt; &gt;not attempted any soap and water cleaning of them. \n&gt; They \n&gt; &gt;appear in great condition to my untrained eye, and\n&gt; so I haven&#39;t \n&gt; &gt;felt any need to clean...).  Most of my pieces have\n&gt; Hozon papers: \n&gt; &gt;would this be any indication at all that the tsuba\n&gt; in question are \n&gt; &gt;more likely to be &quot;deception-free&quot;?  Or is that\n&gt; entirely irrelevant?  \n&gt; &gt;Sorry for all the bothersome questions, but I\n&gt; really am eager to \n&gt; &gt;become informed!  Many thanks, Richard, for your\n&gt; time and \n&gt; &gt;attention...\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Steve\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;--- In nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com, Richard George\n&gt; &lt;\n&gt; &gt;rkg@t...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;steven,\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;first,\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;DON&quot;T MESS WITH THE RUST INSIDE THE SUKASHI \n&gt; &gt;&gt;    \n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;CUTOUTS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Now that I&#39;ve said that...\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;I&#39;ve seen all sorts of tsuba abuse (&quot;brown&quot; wax,\n&gt; various \n&gt; &gt;&gt;    \n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;attempts at \n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;repatination, people who have\n&gt; &gt;&gt;decided they can do a better job of patination\n&gt; than the original \n&gt; &gt;&gt;    \n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;maker \n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;and strip top quality\n&gt; &gt;&gt;pieces down and start over, people who just wax\n&gt; them with \n&gt; &gt;&gt;    \n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;some magic \n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;compound, oil them, etc.,.) - don&#39;t do it -\n&gt; &gt;&gt;basically, Jinsoo is absolutely correct - if the\n&gt; surface patina is \n&gt; &gt;&gt;    \n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;good, \n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;just store &#39;em somewhere where they\n&gt; &gt;&gt;won&#39;t get condensed on and rub them periodically\n&gt; with your \n&gt; &gt;&gt;    \n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;hands/a soft \n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;cloth.  If its got problems, see below...\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;the deadly enemy of iron tsuba is red rust - if\n&gt; your piece has \n&gt; &gt;&gt;    \n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;this on \n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;it, its a problem.  somehow you have to\n&gt; &gt;&gt;get this off - some people use horn, but I&#39;ve\n&gt; found that ivory \n&gt; &gt;&gt;    \n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;seems to \n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;be really good for use to scrape this off\n&gt; &gt;&gt;while not harming the the brown rust (I think Jim\n&gt; Gilbert has an \n&gt; &gt;&gt;excellent article on this in a couple of\n&gt; &gt;&gt;places on line...).  - often you have to work at\n&gt; it quite a bit - I \n&gt; &gt;&gt;sometimes alternate scraping sessions with\n&gt; &gt;&gt;washing the piece in warm water with a mild soap\n&gt; and a soft \n&gt; &gt;&gt;toothbrush...  And again, you only want to\n&gt; &gt;&gt;do this ONLY on the outside surfaces of the tsuba,\n&gt; not down in \n&gt; &gt;&gt;    \n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;the sukashi.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;After you&#39;ve done that, the revealed old rust\n&gt; regions are often \n&gt; &gt;&gt;    \n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;pretty \n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;gnarly, or if the piece is just plain &quot;rough&quot;,\n&gt; &gt;&gt;you can &quot;pocket polish&quot; the piece - just carry it\n&gt; around\n&gt; &gt;&gt;in your pocket for a few weeks (NOT where you\n&gt; carry your keys/\n&gt; &gt;&gt;    \n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;change) - \n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;this gives the piece a nice rubbed look that\n&gt; &gt;&gt;is hard to get by just marathon rubbing sessions\n&gt; with a cloth...\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;When you&#39;re buying tsuba, always be on the lookout\n&gt; for pieces \n&gt; &gt;&gt;    \n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;that have \n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;been &quot;primped&quot; like this - you&#39;ll see\n&gt; &gt;&gt;people that hide a multitude of sins with various\n&gt; waxes, oils, \n&gt; &gt;&gt;    \n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;PAINT (I \n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;got a couple like this - the guy color\n&gt; &gt;&gt;matched the patina and jammed the tsuba (!!) -\n&gt; looked real \n&gt; &gt;&gt;    \n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;darned good, \n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;too - I was quite happy until I tried to clean\n&gt; &gt;&gt;up a rough spot I thought was oil, used some\n&gt; enamel thinner, \n&gt; &gt;&gt;    \n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;and - \n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;surprise!...), etc.,.  I&#39;d like to think they\n&gt; &gt;&gt;just wanted the pieces to look better/didn&#39;t know\n&gt; any better and \n&gt; &gt;&gt;    \n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;really \n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;weren&#39;t thinking fraudulent thoughts, but....\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Good Luck,\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;rkg\n&gt; &gt;&gt;(Richard George)\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;    \n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Milt,\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Jinsoo Kim told me that the best way to care for\n&gt; the old iron \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;sukashi pieces I have is to simply rub them now\n&gt; and then \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;      \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;with a soft \n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;silk cloth.  I have read the various\n&gt; prescriptions for cleaning, \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;waxing, etc... and, as I&#39;ve mentioned, I am quite\n&gt; the novice \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;      \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;and so \n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;am in the dark as to what the current thinking on\n&gt; this is.  The \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;tsuba I have are all in excellent condition, with\n&gt; only minimal \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;      \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;spots \n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;of light surface rust in some of the sukashi\n&gt; openings, and \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;      \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;none on \n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;the plate or rim.
