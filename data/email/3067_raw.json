In the reference examples the first stroke of the first kanji (short vertical top center) touches or crosses the third stroke (top horizontal).  I don&#39;t see any with a significant gap.  The 6th stroke (center vertical bottom) should be straight with some widening at the end, not &quot;hooked.&quot;  The 7th and 8th strokes (bottom diagonals) have a different shape.  The 3rd-5th strokes have different endings.  All of the horizontal strokes of the genuine mei have more of an upslope to them.\n\nI&#39;m not a Somin maven, but his signature is fairly consistent and this one is different on every stroke of the first kanji.  There are differences in the rest as well, but I&#39;ll stop here.\n\nIt&#39;s fairly nice katakiri-bori work, but not up to the level it would have to be.\n\nJim\n\n\n\n  Dear colleagues\n\n  Working on the assumption that any kodogu signed Somin is almost \n  certainly gimei, I should be interested in your comments on the \n  kodzuka in my photo album JPL.  It depicts, on a polished copper \n  ground, Shoki mounted on a shishi.  The single image is rendered on \n  both surfaces in a skillful katakiri-bori, and is continuous across \n  both edges of the kodzuka.\n\n  It is inscribed on the reverse SOMIN with kao, and also bears the \n  inscription GIONEN ROKUSU ROKUSAI (aged 66 years old).\n\n  It is ex the Peak and Gardiner collections, having been purchased by \n  its previous owner in 1948.\n\n  Any and all comments will be most gratefully received.\n\n  Regards, JPL.\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
