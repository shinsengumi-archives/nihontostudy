To \n&gt;   find a stiffer\n&gt;   &gt;   deer one would =\r\nhave to go to the tundra...\n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt;   I recall well a tsuba that I fou=\r\nnd many years ago.  It was a \n&gt;   small, copper\n&gt;   &gt;   sanmai awase (if I =\r\ncorrectly remember a phrase I haven&#39;t \nuttered \n&gt;   for 15 or more\n&gt;   &gt;   =\r\nyears!) with a touch of silver (tin??) showing stylised \n&gt;   (stamped?) wav=\r\nes with a\n&gt;   &gt;   creature on it that I always thought was an &quot;over-endowed=\r\n \n&gt;   rabbit&quot;, but Bob\n&gt;   &gt;   Haynes told me was a fox!!  I wrote to Bob w=\r\nhen I saw a \nsimilar \n&gt;   tsuba in one of\n&gt;   &gt;   his catalogues.  I was am=\r\nazed when he said this was a very \nearly \n&gt;   style of tsuba\n&gt;   &gt;   ca 130=\r\n0 - 1400.  I had it for years, often looking at it and \n&gt;   saying &quot;Do I li=\r\nke\n&gt;   &gt;   it, or do I not??&quot;  Same thing with this deer kinko.  I have \n&gt; =\r\n  gazed at Pete\n&gt;   &gt;   Klein&#39;s image on yahoo (I actually have the Lundren=\r\n \nCollection \n&gt;   book, but it&#39;s\n&gt;   &gt;   out on loan to a &#39;kinko&#39; mate) for=\r\n a long time on this \nsleepless \n&gt;   night, and I\n&gt;   &gt;   ask myself the sa=\r\nme question all over again.  So David Z, if \nI \n&gt;   could ask you a\n&gt;   &gt;  =\r\n question, when you say &quot;I don&#39;t collect kinko at all,  but \nthis \n&gt;   is o=\r\nne of a\n&gt;   &gt;   small number of cases which, granted a opportunity, would \n=\r\nlead me \n&gt;   to alter my\n&gt;   &gt;   policy&quot; I have to ask you &quot;WHY??&quot;  Please =\r\nexplain.\n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt;   If I found this very tsuba I would think it was jun=\r\nk.  I \ndon&#39;t \n&gt;   have to tell you\n&gt;   &gt;   why.  Or do I??  The design spil=\r\nling into the seppadai I have \n&gt;   only seen on tsuba\n&gt;   &gt;   I didn&#39;t care=\r\n for.  The wobbly surface and incredibly bad \nnanako \n&gt;   would kill it\n&gt;  =\r\n &gt;   for me.  And the stiff deer doesn&#39;t do anything for me at \nall.  \n&gt;   =\r\nHowever, I would\n&gt;   &gt;   look at the larger than usual kozuka ana and opine=\r\n &quot;Hmmm, \nmaybe \n&gt;   it&#39;s early&quot;.\n&gt;   &gt;   Back to my question to myself &quot;Do =\r\nI like it, or do I not&quot;.  \nIf I \n&gt;   don&#39;t like it,\n&gt;   &gt;   I don&#39;t collect=\r\n it, no matter what the aesthetes say.\n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt;   Now, this puts me int=\r\no the rustic class, I know, but there is \na \n&gt;   point to this\n&gt;   &gt;   that=\r\n is not all derisory or derogatory.  It is this.  It is \neasy \n&gt;   to pick\n=\r\n&gt;   &gt;   excellent work amongst Edo period tsuba , even in the \niron &quot;wabi-\n=\r\n&gt;   sabi&quot; class,\n&gt;   &gt;   but the archaic styles, the transition between (if=\r\n we might \nsay) \n&gt;   conceptual\n&gt;   &gt;   forerunners and the refined later s=\r\nchools is much, much more \n&gt;   difficult.  Or is\n&gt;   &gt;   it??  Recall here =\r\nMilt&#39;s hawk tsuba that lead to the present \n&gt;   discussion.  And I\n&gt;   &gt;   =\r\ncan show you a tsuba that a well-educated (tsuba knowledge) \nmate \n&gt;   of m=\r\nine\n&gt;   &gt;   dismissed as &quot;late, possibly 1920s&quot;.  It is a masterwork of \nla=\r\nte \n&gt;   Edo/early Meiji\n&gt;   &gt;   and belongs to a friend of mine.  If he giv=\r\nes permission I&#39;ll \nput \n&gt;   up some images\n&gt;   &gt;   of it.\n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt;   S=\r\no, to bring this to a close, are there any others inhabiting \nthe \n&gt;   same=\r\n closet as\n&gt;   &gt;   I???  I know I&#39;m lacking an ability, an aesthetic if you=\r\n \nlike, to \n&gt;   appreciate the\n&gt;   &gt;   stiff deer kinko in question and it =\r\nworries me.  It seems \nwithout \n&gt;   thorough study\n&gt;   &gt;   and training man=\r\ny tsuba in this time frame would indeed be \n&gt;   considered junk and\n&gt;   &gt;  =\r\n sold off, possibly to an ignominious fate.  The other kinko \nthat \n&gt;   Pet=\r\ne shows in\n&gt;   &gt;   two images at the same link does &quot;speak to me&quot;.  It is f=\r\nrom \nthe \n&gt;   same time frame\n&gt;   &gt;   and I find it elegant and refined and=\r\n would collect it.  I \nthink \n&gt;   this discussion\n&gt;   &gt;   parallels the Sue=\r\n Koto kazuuchimono line of thinking with \nblades -\n&gt;   I don&#39;t\n&gt;   &gt;   coll=\r\nect those either...\n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt;   Barry Thomas\n&gt;   &gt;   (Melbourne, Austral=\r\nia)\n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt;   ----- Original Message -----\n&gt;   &gt;   From: &quot;klepet33319&quot;=\r\n &lt;Ppeterdds@&gt;\n&gt;   &gt;   To: &lt;nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt;   &gt;   Sent: Mond=\r\nay, April 17, 2006 5:50 AM\n&gt;   &gt;   Subject: [nihontostudy] Re: in defense o=\r\nf the ugly bird or \n&gt;   seeking more &quot;\n&gt;   &gt;   punishment &quot;\n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n   &gt;   Link to scan &#39;deer&#39; tsuba from Lundgren collection:\n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt;   \n=\r\nhttp://ph.groups.yahoo.com/group/nihontostudy/photos/view/7936?b=3D3\n&gt;   &gt; =\r\n\n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt;   SPONSORED LINKS Buy fine art  Japanese translation  Japanes=\r\ne \n&gt;   incense  \n&gt;   &gt;         Fine art inkjet paper  Fine art printing  Fi=\r\nne art \n&gt;   appraisal  \n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; -------------------------------=\r\n---------------------------------\n----\n&gt;   ----------\n&gt;   &gt;   YAHOO!
