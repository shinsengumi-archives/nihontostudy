However they have\nthis 17th Akasaka tsuba pictured that has a gold\ninlay.  I didn&#39;t think that akasaka worked with\ninlays?  Is this just uncommon or wrong?\nhttp://www.beloit.edu/~museum/wrightonline/exhibit6/e60012a.htm\n\nSite is worth going through, some nice pieces,\nbegining of tsuba section:\nhttp://www.beloit.edu/~museum/wrightonline/exhibit6/e60001a.htm\n\nThanks\nKen &quot;the mantis dude&quot;\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?
