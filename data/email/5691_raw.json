For those unfamiliar with our annual KTK (Kokusai Tosogu Kai)\n&gt; publication, these are high quality printed hard-cover (with slip cover)\n&gt; books showing photographs with descriptions of high quality fittings (the\n&gt; best) selected from members&#39; collections. The KTK is a small private\n&gt; international club of tosogu collectors. Members fund these publications as\n&gt; as a means of supporting our organization (there are no dues) while sharing\n&gt; knowledge of fine tosogu. Each member is expected to buy (10) copies of\n&gt; these limited printings (usually 400 copies) while others will buy twenty or\n&gt; thirty copies and resell them. Myself, I&#39;ve been charging $90 pp to U.S.\n&gt; addresses which is, considering the cost of the photography and final\n&gt; printing, plus shipping. Some members do not even try to break even; myself,\n&gt; I prefer to not particularly take a loss, but that&#39;s just me. Anyway, that&#39;s\n&gt; a little background on these KTK publications. The 2010 edition is already\n&gt; being worked on and will be bigger and better than before, from preliminary\n&gt; indications. Feel free to contact me privately at: swords@... if\n&gt; interested in buying a copy. Those outside of the U.S.A. can buy them\n&gt; cheaper (because of shipping costs) from local members.\n&gt;\n&gt; Ron\n&gt; STL\n&gt;\n&gt;   ----- Original Message -----\n&gt;   From: Andres Pedraza\n&gt;   To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;   Sent: Monday, May 03, 2010 7:33 PM\n&gt;   Subject: [nihontostudy] Re: [nihonto] Chicago chit-chat anyone?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   I&#39;ll plug his KTK books, they&#39;re worth every penny.\n&gt;\n&gt;   Best,\n&gt;\n&gt;   Andres\n&gt;\n&gt;   On 5/3/10, excelsiorilluminati &lt;excelsiorilluminati@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;   &gt; Hi Ron, That&#39;s too bad.

I am trying to match a koshirae for my Nosada. It\n&gt; is\n&gt;   &gt; here, http://www.johnstuart.biz/new_page_14.htm to show what I am going\n&gt;   &gt; for. Of course if anyone else reading this knows of one for sale that\n&gt; would\n&gt;   &gt; be suitable, please rattle my cage. Ron, I completely forgot about the\n&gt; KTK\n&gt;   &gt; book and will remedy that soon, after all I have all the others and they\n&gt;   &gt; always have had something to tickle my fancy.

Do\n&gt; you\n&gt;   &gt;&gt; by any chance have a Mino-bori kogai that is cluttering up the drawer?\n&gt;   &gt;&gt; Anyone else? Of good good to very good quality.
