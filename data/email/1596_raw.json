Looking at Nihonto&#39;s site today I noticed Fred has a Kanemasu tanto for sale. I own two such tanto by Kanemasu, one having been featured as &quot;Tanto of the Month&quot; in Benson&#39;s Bushido publication years ago. \n\nI find it quite curious that all of the Kanemasu tanto I&#39;ve seen--my own and others illustrated--seem to have two mekugi-ana. One is into the Kane character and the other centered on the nakago above the mei. It makes me wonder if this was a happenchance of remounting or if perhaps it was some sort of &quot;trademark&quot; of this smith. I&#39;d like to find out if any of you own a Kanemasu and if so, how does its nakago/menuki-ana look? Hopefully, one or two will be in your hands. \n\nRon\nSTL\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
