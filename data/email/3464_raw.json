I=\r\n would like to give some clue so that readers of \nthis \n&gt; message would cam=\r\ne up with similar beliefe as I did.\n&gt; \n&gt; 1. Chinese emperor was the only on=\r\ne who is entitled to put dragon \n&gt; decors on everything he owned. \n&gt; 2. How=\r\never dragons could also put to use as icons by other persons \nor \n&gt; entitie=\r\ns only if the number of dragon&#39;s fingers reduced to either \n4 \n&gt; or 3. Five=\r\n fingers claws must not be used in any dragon unless the \n&gt; owner of that d=\r\nragon design is Chinese emperor himself. Violation \nof \n&gt; such rule was sub=\r\nject to capital punishment.\n&gt; 3. There used to be a continued flow of sword=\r\n import from Japan \n&gt; dating back more than a thousand years.\n&gt; 4. Swords a=\r\ns possibly one of the contributions to Chinese emperor \n&gt; during Qing Dynas=\r\nty would demand unique design for their tsubas. \n&gt; Guess what design would =\r\nit use?\n&gt; 5. Any contribution to the king would bear no signature of the \n&gt;=\r\n artist. Guess what? This elegant iron tsuba bear no signature on \n&gt; neithe=\r\nr side.  \n&gt; 6. I am in no position to do the authentication on the style of=\r\n \nthe \n&gt; dragon shown on this tsuba. Somehow its style poised to resemble \n=\r\nthe \n&gt; one shown on Meiji coins. There is strong likelihood that this \ntsub=\r\na \n&gt; was of Japan origin dating back to late 19th century.\n&gt; 7. Guess who i=\r\ns in the position in Japan to offer this tsuba as \npart \n&gt; of a sword to Ch=\r\ninese emperor then?\n&gt; \n&gt; I hope you enjoy as much as I when pondering the a=\r\nnswers to those \n&gt; questions. You probably would find some interesting part=\r\n of \ndetails \n&gt; missing. Readers and I would like to hear them.\n&gt; \n&gt; Now, i=\r\nt is time that tsuba expert and historians take over \n&gt; authentication proc=\r\nesses from here. \n&gt; \n&gt; Chen, Ying-chaw\n&gt; Taipei\n&gt;Well Sir,  All the remarks=\r\n about no signature, 5 claws etc. do \npoint to this being a piece that had =\r\nbeen presented to/for the \nChinese emperor. I don&#39;t think even the dowager =\r\nempress would have \nbeen presented a dragon, perhaps a phoenix. However she=\r\n was buried \nwith a pearl in her mouth which I believe was only for emperor=\r\ns. \nThis seems from the design to be a water dragon. Does this seem to \nbe =\r\nSatsuma work anyone? The head of the dragon after the pearl seems \nto be un=\r\ndefined, or maybe too busy don&#39;t you think? John\n\n\n\n\n\n"
