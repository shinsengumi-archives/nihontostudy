I was told that they are dated somewhere around the third century? My question is where do I go to get an honest apraised value on these items. I am not a collector of this type so have no earthly idea where to seek information. Any help would be greatly appreciated.\n&gt;Thanks,\n&gt;Mike\n&gt;\n&gt;-----Original Message-----\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n"
