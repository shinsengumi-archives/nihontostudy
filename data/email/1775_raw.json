The beak is a trunk.  Elephants appear in Buddhist art from quite early times and are often rendered rather unrealistically.  But, since these have the shishi-like fringes of hair they probably represent baku, a mythical chimera.\n\nJim\n\n\n\n  Hi all - \n\n  I&#39;ve just placed photos (front/back) of a pair of interesting menuki in the Yahoo album which, I hope, the below link will show to you:\n\n    http://tinyurl.com/2sudo\n\n    These came off a rather nice, large katana that I just sold to a friend a couple weeks ago. Many of you will recall the discussions that went on years ago (Tom Buttweiler days) regarding Ezo menuki. \n\n    This pair could very well fit the bill for Ezo, but I don&#39;t know. They are rather thin base material and are fairly large, measuring 49 mm (1.9&quot;), thereabout. They do not have posts. The base material could be a yamagani and has the &quot;worn&quot; gold wash that Ezo display. \n\n    The other question regarding these menuki, what motif are they representing? The creature appears to have the body of a shishi but the face of a beaked tengo. Anybody have an answer to this?\n\n    Interesting menuki that hmmmm, should had maybe stayed with the other &quot;Hartmann menuki&quot;...oh well. \n\n    Ron\n    STL\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
