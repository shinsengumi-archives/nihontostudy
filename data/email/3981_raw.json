The color of iron tsuba has often been changed (passively or actively), it depends on the light used to view or photograph and depends very much on the perception of the observer.  I would suggest concentrating on everything else in dating Kanayama tsuba before considering color.\n\nWith that caution, I think that early Kanayama do not tend to show a reddish tone.  Not all Momoyama ones are reddish in my experience, but some are.  So, the observation is valid, but it is not definitive in my opinion.\n\nIf you do try to evaluate iron color use direct but not dazzling sunlight.\n\nJim\n\n\n\n\n  In reading Sasano, I see that he frequently speaks of the color of a \n  given tsuba as being indicative of its age/period, as well as of the \n  qualitative aspects of its iron.  However, he tends not to elaborate \n  on this, and since the images are virtually entirely in black and \n  white in the two well-known English language texts on sukashi tsuba, \n  it is difficult to actually see what he means when he makes such \n  comments.  A few times he does note that Momoyama Kanayama tsuba tend \n  to have a reddish cast to them (as well as being smaller) when \n  compared to Kanayama guards of earlier times.  I was just wondering if \n  this is the consensus among those of you who have much experience with \n  Kanayama tsuba.  If so, is it enough to conclude that such \n  characteristics are so consistent as to be understood as definitive of \n  the period?\n\n  Steven\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
