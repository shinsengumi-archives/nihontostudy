I just found this study group and joined up and \nwhile I am sure that everyone who was kind enough to already help me \nbelongs to this group I was hoping that perhaps some additional \ninput might be derived from within this membership.  \n\nI have put together a small group of pictures of a sword that I \nfrankly am unqualified to provide an opinion or an valuation of.  \nThe mune is about 1/4&quot; wide for about 7&#39; then tapers down to about \n1/8th&quot;. The shinogi in the tapered area appears to be wider than \nthat however. I would appreciate any information one could possibly \nprovide to me.\nRegards\nTom \n\n\n\n\n"
