It is true, of course, that her \ncannonballs were almost certainly of cast iron; I believe that by \nthe end of the C16 stone cannonballs had been virtually completely \nreplaced by iron. It is thus possible that these might be considered \nas one possible source of namban iron.\n\nRegards, John L.\n\n--- In nihontostudy@ &lt;mailto:nihontostudy%40yahoogroups.com&gt;\nyahoogroups.com, &quot;excelsiorilluminati&quot; \n&lt;excelsiorilluminati@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi Dr. Lissenden, John, I believe you are right on about the cannon \n&gt; being unlikely to be iron. Bronze cannon were so much easier to \n&gt; produce and less likely to fail than iron. The only difference of \n&gt; import at this time is bronze was more expensive to use. So, I went \n&gt; to a forum where there are some dedicated historians. I paste the \n&gt; answers below.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Anyway, this might answer your question. The book &#39;The Dutch \n&gt; Discovery Of Japan&#39; by Dirk Jan Barreveld (which is full of errors, \n&gt; but still helpful in gaining an understanding of Dutch trade) \nstates \n&gt; that a report filed by a Jesuit sent to inspect the ship says that \n&gt; the ship had &#39;19 pieces of guns made of bronze&#39; (other sources give \n&gt; the number as 18 or 26). \n&gt; From Turnbull&#39;s Osaka book-Ieyasu had 10 European cannon at the \n&gt; battles of Osaka in 1614-15. 5 were Dutch made &#39;Ishibaya&#39; cannons \n&gt; (which fired shot ranging from 12 lbs to 35-40 lbs-it&#39;s unclear \nwhich \n&gt; type Ieyasu had, though). These were likely from the cannon taken \n&gt; from DeLiefde. The other 5 were bought from the English East India \n&gt; Company and were invoiced by Richard Cocks on December 5, 1614. \nThey \n&gt; included 4 culverins (17.5 lbs) and one saker (5.5 lbs). Out of \nabout \n&gt; 300 artillery pieces Ieyasu fielded at Osaka, these were the only \n&gt; heavy siege guns apart from one Japanese gun. This was \n&gt; the &#39;Shinbatsuji&#39; gun, which was made by Shibatsuji Ryuemon \nSukenobu. \n&gt; It was about 11 feet long with a 90 mm bore, and fired shot about \nthe \n&gt; same size as small Dutch cannon. Unfortunately, it&#39;s not noted what \n&gt; they&#39;re made of-the picture of the Japanese gun (which is at \n&gt; Yasukuni) looks like it was bronze. My Japanese books would likely \n&gt; have this info, but they&#39;re not here .\n&gt; \n&gt; AND\n&gt; \n&gt; Samurai William, p.91, states that the Liefde&#39;s cannon were bronze\n&gt; \n&gt; I still await more information on possible early sources for \n&gt; nambantetsu. I will let you know. It seems so far that article has \na \n&gt; lot of supposition.

Although \ncast-\n&gt; iron \n&gt; &gt; cannon became available ca 1550, these were much more difficult \nto \n&gt; &gt; cast, and bronze remained the metal of choice until the mid to \nlate \n&gt; &gt; C17. Since the &#39;De Liefde&#39; arrived in Kyushu in 1600, is it not \n&gt; highly \n&gt; &gt; likely that its cannon were of bronze rather than of iron?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Is there an expert on cannon out there somewhere who can clarify \n&gt; this \n&gt; &gt; point for me?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Regards, John L.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In nihontostudy@ &lt;mailto:nihontostudy%40yahoogroups.com&gt;\nyahoogroups.com, &quot;Barry Thomas&quot; &lt;warlord@&gt; \n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; All,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;ve just discovered this little gem about the history of \nNamban \n&gt; &gt; tetsu (foreign steel) in Japanese history and the involvement of \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; Dutch V.O.C.
