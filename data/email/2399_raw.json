Unfortunately you don&#39;t include a \nphoto of the kisaki.  The simple iron mounts could indicate a very old \npiece.  They could also indicate one of those very low quality arsenal \npieces they kept to use as loaners to the ashigaru.  The blade looks \nlike it needs a full polish. Uninspiring copper habaki.  The tsuka is \nbadly wrapped in what looks like synthetic tsuka-ito.  I usually pass on \nbuying anything that looks like this.  I especially take a pass if they \nwon&#39;t let you look at the nakago.  Some people think you have to destroy \nthe handle to get it off.  Have you explained to the owner that they \njust slip on and off?  Unless you like the way it looks and can get it \nfor peanuts, my recommendation is to keep looking.\n\nBob\n\npatrikdanielsson wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; Hi, this seems to be a stupid question, but i try anyway, i where \n&gt; looking at an whakizaki, in kind of bad shape, the only photos i have \n&gt; of are thoose in a folder here called Patrik\n&gt; \n&gt; http://photos.groups.yahoo.com/group/nihontostudy/lst?.dir=/Patrik&.sr\n&gt; c=gr&.order=&.view=t&.done=http%3a//briefcase.yahoo.com/\n&gt; \n&gt; The lenght of the sword is around ,around 26 inch,1 inch high at the \n&gt; habaki,its has an saya made of wood, that have a black laquer on it, \n&gt; the tsuka is kind of bad ,the problem is that the seller dont want me \n&gt; to take the tsuka away from the blade.\n&gt; Can some of tell me anything from thoose really bad photos??\n&gt; \n&gt; Best Regards\n&gt; \n&gt; Patrik \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; Yahoo!
