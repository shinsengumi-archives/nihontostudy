Obviously the &#39;armorer&#39; who mounted the sword\nknew nothing about swords, nor cared!  I believe that, like in the US\nduring the war, people donated swords to the government (in the US it\nwas fighting knives) for issue to new officers.  I don&#39;t believe that\nevery &#39;ancestral&#39; blade in a Gunto or Kaigunto mount was mounted by\nthe family of an officer with a &#39;family&#39; blade.  When swords were\nneeded, many were donated to the cause; be it the invasion of China\nand Manchuria or WW2.  That one sword told me that the armories were\nmerely making sharp shiny things for the military and that is as far\nas their knowledge went.  This is speculation, of course, but it\nmakes sense to me especially with some of the swords I have seen.\n\n\nDear Friends,\nAt the risk of making my first contribution to this list argumentative, I\nmust respectfully disagree with Swordnsig.\nOver the years I have owned a couple of blades that were modified in Meiji\ntimes to accommodate gunto koshirae of the era. They have always stuck me\nas very well-crafted and legitimate - if unfortunate - adjustments to\nchanges in sword technology. Whether equipped with a thread bolts of simply\nbent to fit a kyu-gunto tsuka, the work of making these adjustments is\nalways very carefully done so that handle is snug and graceful. Notice that\nthe work is always done to allow a habaki to be installed and removed as\nnecessary. Furthermore, the reworking on nakago is a well established part\nof the nipponto traditions. Think of all the osuriage swords we see and\nnakago with the remnants of wonderful old hori! Finally, I doubt that this\nwork was done in &quot;armories.&quot; I assume instead that it was done by smiths\neager for the work and to please their patrons. In any case, it seems\nentirely wrong to consider the swords that won the Wars again the Chinese\nand the Russians as &quot;merely ..sharp shiny things.&quot; They were well designed,\nexcellent weapons. Not necessarily to traditional tastes, but cutters none\nthe less!\nPeter Bleed\n\n\n\n\n\n"
