I happen to have seen Hagawa-san making &quot;cat\nscratches&quot; (sorry, I can&#39;t recall what he called them). I have seen him do\nboth gold and silver. I think in both cases, the marks are made with a\nspecial tool. It has a series of about 6 sharp teeth on a blade that is\ncurved upward. The tool is pushed on to the surface to be finished in a\nrocking motion. This is why the marked are denser on one side. Obviously,\nseeing this done is pure ballet, but it goes extremely fast, like 30\nseconds to a habaki. The &quot;burr&quot; that Barry mentions is done by burnishing\nthe surface after it has been scratched. In the case of gold, the\nburnishing tool is itself gold with a carefully maintained rough finish. It\nhad to be cleaned (degreased?) before it was used, but it only took a\ncouple of stokes to finish the surface. After that the tools went back to\nits neat little saya!\nPeter Bleed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
