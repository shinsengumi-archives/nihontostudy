Someone on Rich Turners \nmessage board agreed on Mino Goto, and they are probably made from the \nsame hand. However he also said the set had been cleaned and should be \nrepatinated by an expert. I donï¿½t see the damage but what do I know.:)\nI decided to take photos of the menukis as well. However they do not \nseem to match the rest of the fittings. What is your opinion on them?\n\nHere is the menukis.\nhttp://hem.bredband.net/odrike/Menuki2.htm\n\nHere is the rest of the fittings again.\nhttp://hem.bredband.net/odrike/Tosogu1.htm\n\nFredrik\n\n\nRon Hartmann wrote:\n\n&gt;Fredrik - \n&gt;\n&gt;Not having the pictures in front of me at this moment, my impression earlier was that they were the work of Mino Goto, same period. Maybe Jim Gilbert is watching and can elaborate on this for you. \n&gt;\n&gt;Ron\n&gt;STL\n&gt;  ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt;  From: Fredrik Persson \n&gt;  To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n&gt;  Sent: Thursday, April 07, 2005 2:21 AM\n&gt;  Subject: Re: [nihontostudy] Help Kantei a set of fittings\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  Hi,\n&gt;  I&#39;m glad you liked the fittings. :)\n&gt;  Thanks alot for your oppinion Ron it&#39;s highly appriciated.\n&gt;  I was told on another list that the fushi kashira might not be from the \n&gt;  same school as the tsuba, What do you think?\n&gt;\n&gt;  Fredrik\n&gt;\n&gt;  Ron Hartmann wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;  &gt;Hi - \n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;These look pretty typical so-called Mino Goto work of what I like to call average-good quality. There are some made much lower quality and then some that are a step above these. Notice the rounded punchings around the nakago-ana; your tsuba has three at top and seven at the bottom. Most of these kind have these punchings but I seem to recall most have five at the bottom, not seven. I&#39;m not so sure if anyone has ever come up with a reliable answer as to the meaning of these punchings but certainly, these Mino-Goto works do carry them. Age? I think these are still considered middle Edo works, but correct me if I&#39;m wrong. Your fittings do look very nice.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;Ron\n&gt;  &gt;STL\n&gt;  &gt;  ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt;  &gt;  From: Fredrik Persson \n&gt;  &gt;  To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n&gt;  &gt;  Sent: Wednesday, April 06, 2005 2:55 AM\n&gt;  &gt;  Subject: [nihontostudy] Help Kantei a set of fittings\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;  Hi,\n&gt;  &gt;  I would like to have some help with this set of fittings. They are \n&gt;  &gt;  fitted on a Shinto wakizashi signed Bizen no Kami Sukekuni. \n&gt;  &gt;  Unfortunately no one is signed.  I would like to have opinions regarding \n&gt;  &gt;  school, style, technique, design and value.
