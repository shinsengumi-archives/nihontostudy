There are some made much lower quality and then some that are a step above these. Notice the rounded punchings around the nakago-ana; your tsuba has three at top and seven at the bottom. Most of these kind have these punchings but I seem to recall most have five at the bottom, not seven. I&#39;m not so sure if anyone has ever come up with a reliable answer as to the meaning of these punchings but certainly, these Mino-Goto works do carry them. Age? I think these are still considered middle Edo works, but correct me if I&#39;m wrong. Your fittings do look very nice.\n  &gt;\n  &gt;Ron\n  &gt;STL\n  &gt;  ----- Original Message ----- \n  &gt;  From: Fredrik Persson \n  &gt;  To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n  &gt;  Sent: Wednesday, April 06, 2005 2:55 AM\n  &gt;  Subject: [nihontostudy] Help Kantei a set of fittings\n  &gt;\n  &gt;\n  &gt;  Hi,\n  &gt;  I would like to have some help with this set of fittings.
