It promises to be a very interesting &quot;cultural&quot; weekend taking in lots of other interests than swords. Should be good!\n\nRon\nSTL\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: paul bowman \n  To: study group \n  Sent: Sunday, June 03, 2007 10:30 AM\n  Subject: [nihontostudy] Kajihei\n\n\n  Dear All, \n  Im looking for information on Kajihei, the son/student of Jiritaro Naokatsu. \n  He seems to have a mixed reputation in that he was a highly skilled smith but specilaised in making counterfeit blades of top Koto and Shinto smiths. \n  Trying to work out whether he was a victim of the times trying to survive the downturn in demand for swords or just a dishonest but highly skilled crook. \n  All information/ leads gratefully received. \n  thanks \n  PaulB\n\n  ---------------------------------\n  All New Yahoo!
