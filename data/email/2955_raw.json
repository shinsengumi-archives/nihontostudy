What is the solution or recipe for the solution?\n\nKim\n\nRon Hartmann wrote:\n\n&gt;Rich - \n&gt;\n&gt;Repatination of tsuba can be done--correctly--but refinishing such as removing pits, etc., no, I don&#39;t think anyone would want to do that. Sometimes a terrific tsuba is found that has been buffed or whatever and then, repatination can be done to save it. Skip Holbrook used to do this but today--if I understand things correctly--only handles really high quality tsuba. We all experiement with repatination I&#39;m sure, but care must be taken not to (further) damage an important quality tsuba. \n&gt;\n&gt;Several years ago a Japanese  gentleman (artist) was at one of the sword shows displaying his prize-winning newly made tsuba. His tsuba were traditionally made and quite beatufiul...and quite expensive! So there are those around today who continue the craft.\n&gt;\n&gt;Ron\n&gt;STL\n&gt;  ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt;  From: Richard Turner \n&gt;  To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n&gt;  Sent: Thursday, May 12, 2005 4:57 AM\n&gt;  Subject: Re: [nihontostudy] here&#39;s probably a really stupid question\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  LOL, sorry mate, I wasn&#39;t asking if I COULD DO IT, but rather, are there \n&gt;  any professionals in Japan doing this sort of thing.\n&gt;\n&gt;  We would not expect you to be able to restore tsuba LOL.\n&gt;\n&gt;  Rich\n&gt;\n&gt;  Barry Thomas wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;  &gt; I&#39;m no expert by any means (&quot;X&quot; = an unknown factor and &quot;spurt&quot; is a \n&gt;  &gt; drip under pressure!!!), but when Trickie writes:\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; My question for the day then is, if we polish and restore pittings,\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; scratches, chips and the likes from swords, is anything like this\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; ever done on iron tsuba ?\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; my answer would be\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; NOooooooo...\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; How do I know??  In my early days I stuffed a reasonable tsuba or two \n&gt;  &gt; trying to &quot;restore&quot; them  (boo, hisss, shame, brickbats...).  So, I \n&gt;  &gt; wouldn&#39;t advise this at all.
