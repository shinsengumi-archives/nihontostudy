The hamon running off\n&gt;=\r\n the kissaki IS a fatal flaw, make no bones about that. Swords with fatal\n&gt;=\r\n flaws that make Tokubetsu Hozon, Juyo or Yashu saku are swords of\n&gt; extrao=\r\nrdinary worth, and a flaw that is fatal can not take away it&#39;s\n&gt; history. T=\r\nhese swords are typically famous because they are rare, or\n&gt; were carried b=\r\ny someone important or famous. General swords, made by the\n&gt; not so famous =\r\nsword smiths, no matter how nice will most likely fail all\n&gt; attempts at ka=\r\nnteisho if theirs is a fatal flaw like the hamon running\n&gt; off the Ha or Ki=\r\nssaki, a Hagiri and the likes.\n&gt;\n&gt; We all learn hard lessons and we never l=\r\nike being told that our hard\n&gt; earned and well spent money if for naught, b=\r\nut this is a mugs game, it\n&gt; takes nerves of steel and a firm resolve. All =\r\nI can suggest is to get\n&gt; over it and move on. I mean that in the nicest po=\r\nssible way. I am not\n&gt; trying to be smart, just realistic.\n&gt;\n&gt; Good luck\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; Richard Turner\n&gt;\n&gt; Elliott wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I was complaining about learnin=\r\ng nothing from shinsa (NY 2006)other\n&gt; &gt; than a falling off temperline in t=\r\nhe tip is (maybe) a fatal flaw.\n&gt; &gt; Since I am definitly a &#39;newbee&#39; and I s=\r\ntudy, study, study, I found\n&gt; &gt; something called YAKIOTOSHI.
