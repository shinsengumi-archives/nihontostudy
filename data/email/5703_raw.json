I&#39;ve come to admire &quot;his&quot; persistence, although he&#39;s probably a b=\r\noiler room somewhere rather than an individual.\n\nI&#39;m afraid that Gordon may=\r\n be waving his cane and yelling at the kids to stay off his lawn before lon=\r\ng...\n\nI had a chance to look at a very interesting tsuba recently. It&#39;s a t=\r\nypical bird in the plum tree Higo guard, but what&#39;s interesting is that it =\r\nwasn&#39;t completed. The design is scribed into the plate and all of the rough=\r\ning out was done with a chisel. Even the outline of the rim is chiseled in =\r\nwith multiple cuts from both sides. It looks like a slight gouge was used w=\r\nhile cutting the rim and most of the sukashi was cut with a straight chisel=\r\n.\n\nA couple of sections of sukashi have some file work done, but the rest i=\r\ns still rough. It looks like one of the thin branches was chiseled down too=\r\n thin to be finished properly and the piece was abandoned. The color of the=\r\n guard isn&#39;t bad (even though I doubt any patina was applied) and the build=\r\n up on the interior sukashi walls looks about like you&#39;d expect for an Edo =\r\npiece.\n\nI recently spent two weeks shooting in Baja Sur, Mexico. A great pl=\r\nace, other than the developed Cabo area on the southern tip. \n\nA few wildli=\r\nfe photos from both the Pacific and Gulf sides:\n\nhttp://www.flickr.com/phot=\r\nos/jggilbert/sets/72157623839030000/\n\nJim\n\nwww.jimgilbertphoto.com\n\n--- In =\r\nnihontostudy@yahoogroups.com, Richard Turner &lt;ikkanshi@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; and =\r\nI think julius_lopez82@... asked a legit question on Ichimonji ?\n&gt; \n&gt; I had=\r\n a quick check and Jim&#39;s deleted someone named nicemaletrust who \n&gt; keeps c=\r\noming back bit thats all I see.\n&gt; \n&gt; cheers\n&gt; \n&gt; Rich\n\n\n\n\n \t\t \t   \t\t  \n\n[No=\r\nn-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
