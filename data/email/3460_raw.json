I would like to =\r\ngive some clue so that readers of this \nmessage would came up with similar =\r\nbeliefe as I did.\n\n1. Chinese emperor was the only one who is entitled to p=\r\nut dragon \ndecors on everything he owned. \n2. However dragons could also pu=\r\nt to use as icons by other persons or \nentities only if the number of drago=\r\nn&#39;s fingers reduced to either 4 \nor 3. Five fingers claws must not be used =\r\nin any dragon unless the \nowner of that dragon design is Chinese emperor hi=\r\nmself. Violation of \nsuch rule was subject to capital punishment.\n3. There =\r\nused to be a continued flow of sword import from Japan \ndating back more th=\r\nan a thousand years.\n4. Swords as possibly one of the contributions to Chin=\r\nese emperor \nduring Qing Dynasty would demand unique design for their tsuba=\r\ns. \nGuess what design would it use?\n5. Any contribution to the king would b=\r\near no signature of the \nartist. Guess what? This elegant iron tsuba bear n=\r\no signature on \nneither side.  \n6. I am in no position to do the authentica=\r\ntion on the style of the \ndragon shown on this tsuba. Somehow its style poi=\r\nsed to resemble the \none shown on Meiji coins. There is strong likelihood t=\r\nhat this tsuba \nwas of Japan origin dating back to late 19th century.\n7. Gu=\r\ness who is in the position in Japan to offer this tsuba as part \nof a sword=\r\n to Chinese emperor then?\n\nI hope you enjoy as much as I when pondering the=\r\n answers to those \nquestions. You probably would find some interesting part=\r\n of details \nmissing. Readers and I would like to hear them.\n\nNow, it is ti=\r\nme that tsuba expert and historians take over \nauthentication processes fro=\r\nm here. \n\nChen, Ying-chaw\nTaipei \n\n\n\n\n"
