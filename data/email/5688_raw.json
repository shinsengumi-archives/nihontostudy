I am trying to match a koshirae for my Nosada. It=\r\n is here, http://www.johnstuart.biz/new_page_14.htm  to show what I am goin=\r\ng for. Of course if anyone else reading this knows of one for sale that wou=\r\nld be suitable, please rattle my cage. Ron, I completely forgot about the K=\r\nTK book and will remedy that soon, after all I have all the others and they=\r\n always have had something to tickle my fancy.

Do you by any=\r\n chance have a Mino-bori kogai that is cluttering up the drawer? Anyone els=\r\ne? Of good good to very good quality.
