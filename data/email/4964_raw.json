Soon after I sent out this question it dawned on me th=\r\nat by Meiji 4\nthe Tokugawa were no longer in power and therefore, a meaning=\r\nful connection\nbetween this sword and the Tokugawa would be unlikely. But I=\r\n&#39;m glad I asked\nsince this did bring about some on-line discussion. \n\nInter=\r\nestingly, this sword which was owned for years by a good friend and\neventua=\r\nlly came to me last year, looks and feels much like a gendaito which\nI gues=\r\ns, it really is when you think about it. It is a very stoutly build\nand ver=\r\ny masculine blade although made relatively short in length (63.7 cm).\nMy ot=\r\nher nidai Naokatsu which is dated 1865 is more a Nambokucho copy,\nmeasuring=\r\n 77.9 cm with O-gissaki. I find it interesting to see the\ncomparison in so =\r\nfew years but at a time of great &quot;change&quot; in Japan. It does\nsurprise me tha=\r\nt Naokatsu still had a patron at this time of change in\npower. \n\nRon\nSTL\n\n[=\r\nNon-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n \n\n\n\n[Non-text portio=\r\nns of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
