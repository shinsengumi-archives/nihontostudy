If so--and I have a copy myself but have yet to\nreally &quot;get into it&quot;--it is pricey and (I believe) out-of-print. The only\nbook on Goto I had prior to this large work was the one titled: The 17\nGenerations of Goto (Japanese text). I have this in both hard cover and soft\ncover, I believe both being the same inside the covers. It seems very good\nbut as always, so much is missed unless you can read Japanese.\n:\n: Hopefully those who attended this year&#39;s San Francisco show saw the small\nbut significant display of Goto fittings put on by Rick Mantigani and Dan\nBurns. Absolutely awesome kodogu! Unbelievable crisp and &quot;minty&quot; items of\nhigh, high quality makers! This display has been shown the last few years\nbut I really wonder how many people stop to study the treasures displayed.\n:\n: Some of these Goto fittings--and others--have been included as special\ninserts (high quality photos and printing) in the Northern California\ngroup&#39;s newsletter from time to time.\n:\n: Ron\n: STL\n:\n:   ----- Original Message -----\n:   From: JapaneseSwords@...\n:   To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com\n:   Sent: Sunday, September 21, 2003 4:12 PM\n:   Subject: Re: [nihontostudy] goto kodogu study\n:\n:\n:   Lucien,\n:\n:   The best Goto book out there is Goto Book from NBTHK By: Fukushi Sensei\n:   Another good book is SWORD FITTINGS BY THE FAMILY OF GOTO  1440 - 1879\n1994.\n:   Sano Art Museum, Nezu Institute of Fine Arts, Tokugawa Art Museum.\n:\n:   I&#39;m sure that there are other books on Goto fittings, but these two come\nto\n:   mind first.\n:\n:   Lou\n:\n:\n:\n:\n:   [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n:\n:\n:         Yahoo!
