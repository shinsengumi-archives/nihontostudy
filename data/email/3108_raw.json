I didn&#39;t know in the description that they had a \n  Netsuke included.  I didn&#39;t go tonight, so I will be bringing my camera \n  tomorrow to take photos of the item(s).\n\n  Thank you,\n  Kim\n\n  David Zincavage wrote:\n\n  &gt;It is impossible to judge the merit or value of items being auctioned from a description of this sort.  If the fuchi kashira really were Goto, they&#39;d probably be worth more than the estimates, but lots of black and gold Goto-esque kodogu of many levels of quality were produced.  Ojime are netsuke/inro-related, not Nihonto-related.   \n  &gt;\n  &gt; \n  &gt;  ----- Original Message ----- \n  &gt;  From: Kim Ghobrial \n  &gt;  To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n  &gt;  Sent: Friday, July 08, 2005 6:11 PM\n  &gt;  Subject: Re: [nihontostudy] RE: Question....\n  &gt;\n  &gt;\n  &gt;  Hey all,\n  &gt;  I&#39;m not sure what is going on, but every time I send something or reply \n  &gt;  to someone, I don&#39;t get any response from anyone.  I kind of feel like I \n  &gt;  and my posts are invisible to everyone.

There are a \n  &gt;  lot of folks on this list which has expertise in parts of swords or full \n  &gt;  swords and then there are folks, like myself which are learning from \n  &gt;  asking questions and listening to the answers.
