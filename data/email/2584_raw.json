I just got this 2nd tsuba the other day.  I\n&gt; am\n&gt; attaching the photo, however, if Jim didn&#39;t allow\n&gt; attachements I will post it.  I was given\n&gt; attributions\n&gt; of either ko shoami or akasaka mid edo.  I know\n&gt; these\n&gt; aren&#39;t of the highest quality, but I am seeking any\n&gt; comments that can be made about them.  \n&gt; \n&gt; I don&#39;t neccesarily see the signs of casting that\n&gt; normally are seen, ie bubbles around the seppa dai,\n&gt; etc.  However, barring the broken antanae (the 1st\n&gt; one\n&gt; owned) and the wheel leg they match exactly.  The\n&gt; back\n&gt; pattern of the mantis appears to have some different\n&gt; low relief detail carving crosshatch vs lines.  I\n&gt; think the one on the left (newest acquisition) might\n&gt; need a really good cleaning which obscures some of\n&gt; it\n&gt; plus it has some rust pitting here or there. Any\n&gt; comments on them and or manufacture of them?\n&gt; \n&gt; hopefully these pics won&#39;t take too long to load, I\n&gt; just got high speed wireless internet access and I\n&gt; am\n&gt; enjoying extremely fast download seconds!\n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; Ken aka &quot;the mantis dude&quot; \n&gt; \n&gt; __________________________________________________\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?\n&gt; Tired of spam?
