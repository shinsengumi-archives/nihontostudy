It&#39;s the same as the usage of naoshi in kogai naoshi kozuka: a kozuka that is made out of a kogai.  Or a naginata naoshi katana: a katana made from a naginata.  Naoshi does literally mean repaired, but in this context maybe remade is closer to the idea.  If a kogai was damaged, but the jita was still intact it could be remade into another useful fitting.  I suppose that it might even be done if the kogai was fine but not needed for mounting.  Probably a lot of naginata or nagamaki that were remade into katana and wakizashi didn&#39;t have anything wrong with them other than being old fashioned weapons that could be turned into something more useful through shortening and reshaping.\nJim\n\nI guess they could be referring to a repaired fuchi.\nSeems there would be better items to discuss tho.\n\nThanks\nRich S\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
