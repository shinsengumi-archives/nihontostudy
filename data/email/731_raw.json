The fuchi--all that remained of the tsuka fittings--was of plain \nshakudo with the motif of (I&#39;m guessing) a &quot;Noh character&quot; and a &quot;closed fan in \na holder.&quot; Oddly, this decoration was &quot;pinned&quot; to the fuchi rather than \nsoldered on. Never saw that before! Actually, it was a bit loose and seemed like a \ncareless way of attaching this to the base metal, but it was quite old and done \noriginally and not post-war by some GI. Anyone else ever seen this method \nused?\n\nRon\nSTL\nRon,\nI have a nanako ground fucchi with a tiny square hole...I assumed some &quot; \ndecoration &quot;  ( a mon ? )had fallen out.\n\nMilt\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
