In addition I have\npurchased from Ron.  I would purchase from all of them\nagain.  Many tsuba are not papered, it is not worth\nthe cost of many to put them through shinsa.  Since it\nis much harder to attribute to a particular smith, you\nwill also be likely to get a paper to a general school\n(for the unsigned ones).  There are all price points.\n\nThe only one I have not purchased from is that Kurt\nHoltz dude.  The major reason is that he tries to pass\noff crickets as preying mantises.  As if I don&#39;t know\nthe difference.  Gets me all excited in searching ebay\nand have a hit other than the Chen crappers and it\nturns out to be a waste.  Even mentions me by name,\nlike he couldn&#39;t just email me. \n\nBe careful buying books, especially those japanese\nones.  They are addicting in their own right and then\nyou end up with all these books you can&#39;t read.  Of\ncourse, if you can read them, I will tell you which\nones to buy and you can translate them for me.  \n\nRemember tsuba are 2 sided, if one sided don&#39;t buy or\nif already purchased certainly don&#39;t email list that\nyou baught a 1 sided tsuba (I love to bring this\nincident up makes me still laugh- happened to a list\nmember a few years ago).  Milt can give you a\ndissertation on how to buy on ebay.  Tom Helm can also\ntell you why those tsuba&#39;s recommended by Milt suck. \nActually I have gotten a few off ebay over the years\nand prices are usually good.  Just don&#39;t buy anything\nfrom China, unless from a pilot living in Hong Kong\nbut he only cares about hizen (he gets touchy about\ncondemning all of china- basically don&#39;t buy from the\nbillion or so people minus one).\n\nOk, I put a lot of list history in this post and most\nlikely you have no idea of the stories behind them,\nbut I am reminiscing.  Buy some books and find some\ncollectors to handle tsuba.  Some like kinko some like\nsukashi, some like both.\n\nYou can always ask questions here.   Just remember\nthat any preying mantis themed tsuba and/or sword\nfittings must be cheaply sold to me.  Milt keeps on\ntrying to sell me stuff at full retail when I know he\ngot them cheap, plus I am originally from NY and we\ndon&#39;t pay retail!  He complains about son&#39;s tuition at\nBU and I keep telling him, I went to Grad school there\nand they aren&#39;t getting anymore of my money.  Have\nfun!\n\nall the best,\nKen aka &quot;the mantis dude&quot; a puveyor of all kamakiri\ntosogou\n\n--- Ron Hartmann &lt;swords@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; Anthony - \n&gt; \n&gt; Sorry to sound like such a &quot;merchant&quot; but if you&#39;re\n&gt; interested I can send you some pictures of a very\n&gt; nice selection of good quality iron tsuba that I&#39;m\n&gt; selling. Most are $200 range, more or less. If you\n&gt; are new at this I would be happy to recommend good\n&gt; ones that would help teach you about these things.\n&gt; Some of these have been to a number of shows and are\n&gt; now kept home so that I can keep my table at the\n&gt; shows, fresh. All are authentic, for sure. The shows\n&gt; seem to have a wonderful selection of nice quality\n&gt; tsuba these days and that is good for the buyer, bad\n&gt; for the seller since there is such a &quot;selection&quot; to\n&gt; pick from. Anyway...just thought I&#39;d toss this idea\n&gt; out to you. I&#39;ve been around for going on 40\n&gt; years...gosh, that&#39;s a little frightening to put in\n&gt; writing! \n&gt; \n&gt; Ron\n&gt; STL\n&gt;   ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt;   From: anwahi \n&gt;   To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n&gt;   Sent: Wednesday, December 21, 2005 4:23 PM\n&gt;   Subject: [nihontostudy] Where do you buy your\n&gt; Tsuba?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   Hello,\n&gt; \n&gt;   I&#39;m new here and to collecting Tsuba. Where do you\n&gt; buy your Tsuba from? \n&gt;   I know there&#39;s several websites you can find with\n&gt; a Google search, an \n&gt;   occasional Token Kai show like the one in SF, or\n&gt; Ebay (most look like \n&gt;   junk). I&#39;m looking for good sources of authentic\n&gt; Tsuba. Obviously the \n&gt;   only way to be really sure of authenticity is to\n&gt; purchase papered \n&gt;   Tsuba, but because I&#39;m starting off I want some\n&gt; sources of authentic \n&gt;   Tsuba more reasonably priced. Any suggestions?\n&gt; \n&gt;   Thanks for your helpo in advance,\n&gt;   Anthony\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;   YAHOO!
