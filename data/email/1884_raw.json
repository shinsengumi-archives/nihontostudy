I came across the work of the 2nd hereditary \nmaster Nishigaki Kanshiro in 3 books last night and think that it may \nalso be possible that this is the work of a student of his. The \nsimularies are numoerous, except the quality of the work with Kanshiro&#39;s \nwork much finder in detail and plate. These of course could be just \ncopied by another artist from another school but I am tneding to agree \nwith the Nishigaki idea myself as well.\n\nThanks for the conversation and thought&#39;s.\n\nRich\n\nRon Hartmann wrote:\n\n&gt; Sorry...hit the wrong key!!!  Let me resend this...\n&gt;\n&gt; G&#39;day Rich -\n&gt;\n&gt; My opinions are based largely on &quot;gut feeling&quot; when seeing the guard \n&gt; since, on photographs at least, these groups do resemble each other. \n&gt; Having the tsuba in-hand would of course make for a stronger argument \n&gt; for (or against) the groups mentioned, I would think.\n&gt;\n&gt; Maybe I shouldn&#39;t had called the edge treatment &quot;bones&quot; but it would \n&gt; be the lines visiable from the three-fold construction of Akasaka. \n&gt; Last year I purchased a wonderful &quot;willow tree&quot; iron sukashi tsuba, \n&gt; mumei--one of my &quot;dream&quot; tsuba ever since Sasano illustrated this \n&gt; motif in his sukashi tsuba book. I felt it was Akasaka and it did have \n&gt; these linear lines (bones?) in its edge. Jim Gilbert and Henrik \n&gt; Eschbaum...\n&gt;\n&gt; (Was checking a spelling and accidently &quot;sent&quot; this...hope I got the \n&gt; right name here!)\n&gt;\n&gt; Anyway, they did agree to Akasaka and pointed out this layering which \n&gt; was quite evident on this tsuba. Of course, I was thrilled. In this \n&gt; case the guard could had been Kyo-sukashi or even Higo. It brought \n&gt; some nice discussion.\n&gt;\n&gt; As for Tosa Myochin, I have not had a lot of experience with their \n&gt; work but do think the plate might not be a &quot;good&quot; compared to Akasaka. \n&gt; They also often used the &quot;mustache&quot; type chiseling around the \n&gt; nakago-ana. Your tsuba does not show this (nor does one I have that is \n&gt; signed Tosa Myochin). When I see the surface decoration as is in your \n&gt; tsuba, I must admit it shoots me to Nishigaki group. Interesting to \n&gt; compare this treatment of the various Higo groups illustrated in \n&gt; Sasano&#39;s books.\n&gt;\n&gt; Exciting tsuba, all!!  Again, sorry for the incomplete earlier email.\n&gt;\n&gt; Ron\n&gt; STL\n&gt;\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
