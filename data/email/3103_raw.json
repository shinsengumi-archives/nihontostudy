My maxim is not to buy anything I cannot hold in\n&gt;my hand and judge for myself.  There are far too many subtleties to do otherwise\n&gt;on my very limited budget.  If I were a rich man it would be a slightly\n&gt;different story, but that&#39;s the way of the world.  Fittings are a little better\n&gt;judged from GOOD photos, but from a description such as yours one can only\n&gt;comment in the most general of terms in essay format, which in practice amount\n&gt;to nothing that would really help you.  The best way to learn is to buy and make\n&gt;mistakes - you WILL make mistakes, I can guarantee that.  So, yes, please give a\n&gt;link to what you seek an opinion on.\n&gt;\n&gt;Barry Thomas.\n&gt;\n&gt;----- Original Message -----\n&gt;From: &quot;Kim Ghobrial&quot; &lt;imports@...&gt;\n&gt;To: &lt;nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt;Sent: Saturday, July 09, 2005 11:11 AM\n&gt;Subject: Re: [nihontostudy] RE: Question....\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Hey all,\n&gt;I&#39;m not sure what is going on, but every time I send something or reply\n&gt;to someone, I don&#39;t get any response from anyone.  I kind of feel like I\n&gt;and my posts are invisible to everyone.  The other lists that I&#39;m on, I\n&gt;get some type of response from someone, and I don&#39;t feel like I&#39;m\n&gt;ignored.  If someone doesn&#39;t know, I would like to know this, if I need\n&gt;to get Photos let me know, but don&#39;t ignore the questions.  There are a\n&gt;lot of folks on this list which has expertise in parts of swords or full\n&gt;swords and then there are folks, like myself which are learning from\n&gt;asking questions and listening to the answers.  I don&#39;t have tons of\n&gt;money for expensive books, what books I do have, do not cover areas\n&gt;which I&#39;m asking questions about.  So, please, if someone asks a\n&gt;question, please acknowledge it, even if it is an answer like, &quot;I don&#39;t\n&gt;know the answer.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;In the case of the question below, would it help in getting a photo of\n&gt;the pieces and putting it up on this list for all of you to see?\n&gt;\n&gt;Sincerely,\n&gt;Kim\n&gt;\n&gt;Kim Ghobrial wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Hi Everyone,\n&gt;&gt;Sorry to ask this, but I was looking at an Auction, which I&#39;m going to\n&gt;&gt;see tomorrow and wanted to know if this is something for me to look at\n&gt;&gt;or not.  Also, if it is okay, if the estimate of $120.00-180.00 is okay\n&gt;&gt;for this piece.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;THREE JAPANESE COLLECTIBLES: two sword fittings, Fuchi-kashira\n&gt;&gt;attributed to the Goto School having &quot;kiku&quot; and &quot;kiri&quot; motifs with gold\n&gt;&gt;accents on black field, late Edo-early Meiji Period; together with\n&gt;&gt;*ivory* carved ojime, inlaid, &quot;Fukuzuke&quot; (good luck) design, signed by\n&gt;&gt;the carver, attributed to the Meiji Period.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Kim\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;Yahoo!
