They are pretty rare and I own only a couple and have seen\nonly a few others. In that regard, I have liked looking at other Namban\ntsuba and cupped guards. All that to say this is an interesting thread.\nJohn, I&#39;d love to see your rapier style guard if you can post a pic.\nLet me say, however,  that I am not certain about the link between cupped\ntsuba and European swords. I have seen a number of cupped tsuba that I\nsuppose could be inspired by European cuphilts, but may of these look like\nthey are Hizen style rather than &quot;Namban&quot; (whatever that is). Furthermore,\nin the case of the tsuba that got this conversation started, it looks to me\nlike the cup would have pointed TOWARD the blade! Pretty different from the\nEuropean cuphilt style.\nPeter\n\n\n\nPeter Bleed\nAssociate Dean\nCollege of Arts and Sciences\n1223 Oldfather Hall\nUniversity of Nebraska\nLincoln, NE 68588-0312\n(402) 472-2891\n\n\n\n"
