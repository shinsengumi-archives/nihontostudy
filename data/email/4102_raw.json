For those of you who have wondered about okita&#39;s swords\n&gt; please dont worry too much about what happened to them but wonder if\n&gt; the swords he had was his. I found a website talking about Okita&#39;s\n&gt; swords and what happened. I shall qoute the paragraphs.&quot;Reproduction\n&gt; of Souji Okita&#39;s Sword\n&gt;\n&gt; Sources: Please insert the links below into: babelfish.altavista.com\n&gt; and click translate from Japanese to English:\n&gt;\n&gt; Other sources:http://www.jaxion.com/samurais.net/sword.htm\n&gt; http://www.jaxion.com/samurais.net/katana/hm15.htm\n&gt; www.n-p-s.net/kiyomitu.htm\n&gt; www.shinsengumihq.com\n&gt; www.miburo.com\n&gt;\n&gt; (IMG:http://img14.imgspot.com/u/05/97/16/kiyomitu102.jpg)\n&gt;\n&gt; In fact, a famous sword Okita used at Ikeda-ya (one supposedly made\n&gt; by Kojiki Kiyomitsu) is said to have broken. This is the sword I&#39;ve\n&gt; seen on most websites being sold as &quot;Okita&#39;s favorite&quot;.\n&gt;\n&gt; According to some sources, after that sword broke, he used a sword\n&gt; made by Yamatonokami Yasusada. The sword was 2.2 shaku long\n&gt; according to a source at www.n-p-s.net/aitoh.htm , but my\n&gt; photocopied page from a swordbook (name of book lost long ago) says\n&gt; it was 2 shaku, 3 sun, and 6 bu long.\n&gt;\n&gt; On a side note, OishiKuwajiro (known by the nickname&quot;\n&gt; hitokirikuwajiro) also used a sword made by Yamatonokami Yasusada\n&gt; that was 2 shaku 5 sun in length according to this site\n&gt; www.bakusin.com/jiten41.html\n&gt;\n&gt; Okita&#39;s most famous sword, though, was the &quot;Kikuichimonji&quot;, which\n&gt; was 2 shaku 4 sun 2 bu in length. There is some speculation as to\n&gt; whether he actually owned such a valuable sword, but we will\n&gt; probably never know if he really owned it since it was supposedly\n&gt; lost after he died. If you are interested in reading more about it,\n&gt; I recommend Shinsengumi Keppuroku by Shiba Ryotaro.\n&gt;\n&gt; As far as the swords being accurate, for sure Hijikata&#39;s is\n&gt; accurate. Unfortunately the model on that page is the &quot;affordable\n&gt; model&quot;. The exact replica which is listed on Ozawa swords Japan is\n&gt; quite a bit more.\n&gt;\n&gt; Okita&#39;s replica is in what they call handachi (han-dachi)mounts,\n&gt; literally &quot;half tachi&quot; mounts, which come from the pre-edo periods\n&gt; where there was a transition from tachi to katana. Unfortunately,\n&gt; i&#39;ve seen conflicting data on if his Ichimonji blade was mounted in\n&gt; handachi mounts. He owned one other sword besides the Kiku Ichimonji\n&gt; and that one could have been the one mounted handachi style.&quot; I hope\n&gt; this will help you think better and to tell ya we might not ever\n&gt; find his swords. Thanks for reading this and I hope that someone\n&gt; will find them.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
