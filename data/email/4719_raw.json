If your sword is a shinto sword, \nit \n&gt; was almost for cert=\r\nain carried by a samurai. The question then \n&gt; becomes, if this sword was g=\r\nood enough for a real samurai without a \n&gt; bo-hi, how is it that it is sudd=\r\nenly not good enough without a bo-\nhi \n&gt; now? \n&gt; \n&gt; Additionally, isn&#39;t cut=\r\nting a &#39;striking event&#39;, and if it is, isn&#39;t \n&gt; final momentum a critical f=\r\nactor in addition to cutting motion? \nAnd, \n&gt; isn&#39;t momentum made up of mas=\r\ns X velocity? Therefore, by removing \n&gt; metal for a bo-hi won&#39;t that reduce=\r\n the mass, thereby reduce the \n&gt; striking force of the cut? While you could=\r\n possibly increase the \n&gt; velocity with a lighter sword to compensate some,=\r\n the best result \n&gt; would come from a combination of both.\n&gt; \n&gt; Historicall=\r\ny, the reason for bo-hi is to reduce battle fatigue \n&gt; (lactic acid build u=\r\np) from making cut after cut for an extended \n&gt; period of time. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; re=\r\ngards,\n&gt; Franco\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com, En=\r\nore Gardonio &lt;egardon@&gt; \n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Thank you Peter. I will certainly=\r\n keep the advice in mind. Don&#39;t \n&gt; forget \n&gt; &gt; though, a sword is made for =\r\na reason and I don&#39;t believe its for \n&gt; &gt; appreciation of its beauty. First=\r\n and foremost it was made to be \n&gt; used. I \n&gt; &gt; see nothing wrong with prac=\r\nticing with it. I intend to take very \n&gt; good \n&gt; &gt; care of it..........

I woul=\r\nd urge you not to alter \n&gt; your  sword\n&gt; &gt; &gt; in the way you are describing.=\r\n If you want a grooved blade \norder \n&gt; one or\n&gt; &gt; &gt; find one. At the very l=\r\neast you should not do anything until \nyou \n&gt; have had\n&gt; &gt; &gt; your blade wel=\r\nl shinsa&#39;d.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Still, your question does point up a basic feature of the=\r\n world \nof\n&gt; &gt; &gt; nippon-to. The values and standards of the various people =\r\n\n&gt; involved in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Japanese swords are diverse. What is absolutely &quot;wrong=\r\n&quot; to some \n&gt; is &quot;just\n&gt; &gt; &gt; fine&quot; to others. Most of us base our actions on=\r\n our views of \n&gt; aesthetics and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; a sense of historical preservation. T=\r\nhere are other values out \n&gt; there and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; knowing that helps to understa=\r\nnd some of the things we see \nabout \n&gt; swords.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; When I was first in Ja=\r\npan I happened to meet a number of sword \n&gt; craftsmen\n&gt; &gt; &gt; rather than col=\r\nlectors. Of course this was interesting (heck, \nit \n&gt; was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; wonderful),=\r\n but it may have given me a skewed view.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 1. The first &quot;smith&quot; I met (=\r\n and he was an important artist-and \na\n&gt; &gt; &gt; wonderful person) was re-tempe=\r\nring some old swords when I \nvisited \n&gt; his\n&gt; &gt; &gt; forge.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 2.  An impor=\r\ntant kinko proudly showed me his portfolio that \n&gt; included some\n&gt; &gt; &gt; very=\r\n excellent &quot;umegane&quot; work he had done. He assured me \nthat &quot;no \n&gt; one could=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; see&quot; the fillings he had put into some seriously flawed blades.\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; 3. During a road trip with a fellow who had recently completed \nhis\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n polishing apprenticeship, we took a long extra trip to let his \n&gt; teacher =\r\nsee\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the grooves he was carving on a tanto. He was proud of his work \n=\r\n&gt; and his\n&gt; &gt; &gt; master approved. When I asked why he was doing it, he said =\r\n&quot;the \n&gt; smith\n&gt; &gt; &gt; should have put the grooves in.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; These men are no=\r\nt crooks or villains. Indeed, I think they are \n&gt; great\n&gt; &gt; &gt; artists and s=\r\nkilled students, but they operate with a different \n&gt; set of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; values.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; You certainly can find craftsmen who will do what you ask of \n&gt; them,=\r\n but one\n&gt; &gt; &gt; thing is clear. You will only be able to cut grooves in your=\r\n \n&gt; sword once.
