That style with the cupped shape and nunome zogon is often labeled Hizen.  I don&#39;t recall seeing one made with two-layer construction like that, though.  Does the other plate just cover the flat area, or does it follow the cup all of the way to the rim?\n\nJim \n\n\n\n  greetings all, I lifted this of my message board, \n  http://pictures.care2.com/view/1/743171541 the owner is stumped and so \n  are the rest of us I think. This concerns images 1 & 2.  Notice in the \n  tight shot of the nagako ana, three is obviously 2 plate of metal, I \n  thought I was looking at leather or something at first but it is \n  obviously iron. What would be the purpose of the, is it common/rare, he \n  was wondering if there is a known style/school/era for this piece.\n\n  cheers\n\n  Rich\n\n\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n        Yahoo!
