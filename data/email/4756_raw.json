Simply Google &quot; \nHistorical Classification of =\r\nWakizashi.&quot;  I&#39;m sure you will find it \ninformative.  I also recall reading=\r\n other material which indicated \nswords forged of the length between 1 and =\r\n2 shaku from the (approx.) \ntime period of 1200 to 1400 AD are &quot;very few&quot; i=\r\nn number.  After 1400 \nAD there were many.  The &quot;percentage probability&quot; wo=\r\nuld most likely \nplace your sword in late Ko-to, perhaps early Shin-to, how=\r\never, you \ncan&#39;t rule out the possibility of it being a 13/14th century bla=\r\nde. \nThe faint inscription, many polishes, could place it among the very \nf=\r\new....    Good luck,      Dave\n\n\n- In nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Doug B=\r\nlain&quot; &lt;dblain@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; It is shinogi zukuri,  22&quot; long from the tip =\r\nto the mune machi, \nkaki-toshi\n&gt; and ubu as far as I can tell.  The total l=\r\nength is 27.2&quot;. \nOriginally it was\n&gt; very wide since the nakago is 5/16&quot; at=\r\n the widest. The blade has \nbeen\n&gt; through many polishes and is now narrows=\r\n to 3/16&quot; (sorry but I \nwill probably\n&gt; never convert to metric). What is v=\r\nisible of the hamon is very \nnarrow suguha\n&gt; (1/8&quot;) and no turnback on the =\r\nboshi. The size and length did \nbother me since\n&gt; I also thought the wakisa=\r\nshi was introduced later, but it is what \nit is,\n&gt; hence my curiosity about=\r\n any additional information on the smith. \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Doug Blain\n&gt; \n&gt;   __=\r\n___  \n&gt; \n&gt; From: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n[mailto:nihontostudy@yahoogr=\r\noups.com] On\n&gt; Behalf Of klepet33319\n&gt; Sent: December 9, 2006 7:36 PM\n&gt; To:=\r\n nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: [nihontostudy] Re: Miike school sm=\r\nith Sada Hide\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Doug -- although I am more of a fittings guy I wa=\r\ns caught by the \ntime \n&gt; period.
