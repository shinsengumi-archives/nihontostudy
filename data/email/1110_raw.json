I am not sure why this happens as I an not into\n  metallurgy. It is not due to ji-nie, because ji-nie is not common in such\n  Kyushu works - excepting the Samonji school. It is probably due to the type\n  of sand iron available in Kyushu during the Koto period. This feature\n  disappears during the Shinto period due to changes in iron manufacturing and\n  the importation of foreign iron.\n\n\n\n  Gordon\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
