Not so odd to those who have been around the study for awhile.  \nThese are so called as it is said, but has not been proven, that  \nTakeda Shingen&#39;s hand-picked personal guard and messenger unit the  \nMukade-Tai wore these on their swords. Shingen himself is said to  \nhave awarded these as badges of merit to his troops. For this reason  \nthey are quite popular and there have been many copies of this design.\n\tYour example looks to be all copper given that the surface of the  \nseppa-dai appears to have been hammered and there are tiny stars  \npunched into the surface. Originals if such a thing exists are indeed  \ncopper or brass wire woven thru an iron plate. Mukade BTW means  \nCentipede...\n-t\n\n\nOn Nov 4, 2007, at 10:12 AM, yecheal wrote:\n\n&gt; img600x399-1193623914p1010984.jpg\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
