Looking at Nihonto&#39;s site today I noticed Fred \nhas a Kanemasu tanto for sale. I own two such tanto by \nKanemasu, one having been featured as &quot;Tanto of the Month&quot; in \nBenson&#39;s Bushido publication years ago. \n&gt; \n&gt; I find it quite curious that all of the Kanemasu tanto I&#39;ve \nseen--my own and others illustrated--seem to have two \nmekugi-ana. One is into the Kane character and the other \ncentered on the nakago above the mei. It makes me wonder if \nthis was a happenchance of remounting or if perhaps it was \nsome sort of &quot;trademark&quot; of this smith. I&#39;d like to find out if any\nof \nyou own a Kanemasu and if so, how does its \nnakago/menuki-ana look? Hopefully, one or two will be in your \nhands. \n&gt; \n&gt; Ron\n&gt; STL\n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\nHi Ron. on Jan 27th i posted a question on Rich Turners \nNihon-to board regarding a Katana i own signed  No Shu Seki Ju \nKane Masu, I included a pic. of the Mei, only one mekugi-ana, \nhave a look and see what you think.\nRegards Steve. \n\n\n"
