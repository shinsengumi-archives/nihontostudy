I will certainly keep the advice in mind. Don&#39;t forget \nthough, a sword is made for a reason and I don&#39;t believe its for \nappreciation of its beauty. First and foremost it was made to be used. I \nsee nothing wrong with practicing with it. I intend to take very good \ncare of it.......... I consider myself  very lucky to own such a piece.\nEnore\n\nPeter A Bleed wrote:\n&gt; Enore,\n&gt; I want to second Gordon&#39;s advice. I would urge you not to alter your  sword\n&gt; in the way you are describing. If you want a grooved blade order one or\n&gt; find one. At the very least you should not do anything until you have had\n&gt; your blade well shinsa&#39;d.\n&gt; Still, your question does point up a basic feature of the world of\n&gt; nippon-to. The values and standards of the various people involved in\n&gt; Japanese swords are diverse. What is absolutely &quot;wrong&quot; to some is &quot;just\n&gt; fine&quot; to others. Most of us base our actions on our views of aesthetics and\n&gt; a sense of historical preservation. There are other values out there and\n&gt; knowing that helps to understand some of the things we see about swords.\n&gt; When I was first in Japan I happened to meet a number of sword craftsmen\n&gt; rather than collectors. Of course this was interesting (heck, it was\n&gt; wonderful), but it may have given me a skewed view.\n&gt; 1. The first &quot;smith&quot; I met ( and he was an important artist-and a\n&gt; wonderful person) was re-tempering some old swords when I visited his\n&gt; forge.\n&gt; 2.  An important kinko proudly showed me his portfolio that included some\n&gt; very excellent &quot;umegane&quot; work he had done. He assured me that &quot;no one could\n&gt; see&quot; the fillings he had put into some seriously flawed blades.\n&gt; 3. During a road trip with a fellow who had recently completed his\n&gt; polishing apprenticeship, we took a long extra trip to let his teacher see\n&gt; the grooves he was carving on a tanto. He was proud of his work and his\n&gt; master approved. When I asked why he was doing it, he said &quot;the smith\n&gt; should have put the grooves in.&quot;\n&gt; These men are not crooks or villains. Indeed, I think they are great\n&gt; artists and skilled students, but they operate with a different set of\n&gt; values.\n&gt; You certainly can find craftsmen who will do what you ask of them, but one\n&gt; thing is clear. You will only be able to cut grooves in your sword once. I\n&gt; urge you to proceed with caution.\n&gt; Peter\n&gt;\n&gt; Peter Bleed\n&gt; Professor of Anthropology\n&gt; 810 Oldfather Hall\n&gt; University of Nebraska\n&gt; Lincoln, NE 68588-0368\n&gt; (402) 472-2439\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;                                                                            \n&gt;              &quot;Gordon Robson&quot;                                               \n&gt;              &lt;robsongo@....                                             \n&gt;              jp&gt;                                                        To \n&gt;              Sent by:                  &lt;nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com&gt;      \n&gt;              nihontostudy@yaho                                          cc \n&gt;              ogroups.com                                                   \n&gt;                                                                    Subject \n&gt;                                        RE: [nihontostudy] Bo-hi            \n&gt;              12/05/2006 05:16                                              \n&gt;              PM                                                            \n&gt;                                                                            \n&gt;                                                                            \n&gt;              Please respond to                                             \n&gt;              nihontostudy@yaho                                             \n&gt;                 ogroups.com                                                \n&gt;                                                                            \n&gt;                                                                            \n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi Enore,\n&gt;\n&gt; Are you talking about taking an antique sword and cutting a groove in it? I\n&gt; hope not. There is no one I know of in Japan who would do that. And I think\n&gt; you would be hard pressed to find someone who would even do it to a newly\n&gt; made blade. The sword comes as it is and anything added later is typically\n&gt; not seen as a good thing.\n&gt;\n&gt; Gordon\n&gt;\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com [mailto:nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com] On\n&gt; Behalf Of egardonio\n&gt; Sent: Wednesday, December 06, 2006 2:28 AM\n&gt; To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: [nihontostudy] Bo-hi\n&gt;\n&gt; Hello everybody, I&#39;m new to this forum so if I make an error please\n&gt; remember that.
