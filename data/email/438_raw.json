I find it necessary to keep a list of the titles I own\n    (senility) to keep from ordering duplicates, and when I was entering this\n    book on my list, I found no publisher, place, or date of publication\n  listed.\n\n    My impression is that the JSS/US was the publisher, is that correct?  Mr.\n    Robson refers to &quot;an auspicious day&quot; in 1997.  This just appeared, did it\n    not?\n\n    What, by the way, is the Japanese for &quot;auspicious day?&quot;\n\n\n\n          Yahoo!
