Several of the boys were kind of interested but I discouraged this since it sounded like such an odd-ball thing and the mei was definitely not reliable. (I never did go look at it pre-sale.) Another local fellow ended up winning it (for much too much, in my opinion) and today was my first chance to actually see this thing in-hand. (I&#39;m told it weighs over 5 lbs.)\n\nMy question here is, does anyone know why such a blade as this was even made? \n\nThe blade measures 24.4&quot; inches with a short nakago of 9.7&quot; more or less. The unfinished nakago (no file marks and kind of &quot;bar stock&quot; looking) measures 0.6&quot; thickness at the munemachi. The nakago is signed as I said but is really not &quot;finished&quot; in any professional manner. \n\nThe blade is forged and has a hamon -- I still need to sit down with this, but not today -- and you do see a couple small ware in places. The  saya and pole are as expected; massive. These look very &quot;shinshin-to&quot; or &quot;Meiji&quot; to my eye. \n\nThis was definitely not a weapon to be used. We wondered if it was for an offering but even if that, one would think the nakago would had been finished better. Anyone ever find anything out about this kind of thing and what they were made for??? \n\nInteresting, sort of, but I&#39;m glad I did not put my money into it. I believe it sold around mid-$3k or so after commission and sales tax. \n\nRon\nSTL\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
