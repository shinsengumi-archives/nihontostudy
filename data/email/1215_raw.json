I believe I read \nin Fukunaga that Shingen&#39;s corps of top-notch troops was the \n&quot;Mukade-tai&quot; , not sure of the tai bit, they were used as guard and \npersonal messenger for the commander. Besides the hata-jirushi (flag) \nthey were privileged to wear a mukade tsuba. My recollection is that it \nis not certain what the actual design was but were held to be instantly \nrecognizable. Most examples are from much later times but there are one \nor two of the &quot;wired&quot; design that have the right age but there is no \nevidence linking them concretely to Shingen or this group.\n\tI wrote this up for the NCJSC some years back so do not remember what \nall it said or which issue it was in...\n-t\n\n\n"
