The brass fittings do not look to be of Japanese workmanship, especially the lack of a proper and neat finish where the metal edges meet the scabbard wood.  This is especially true where the handle butts up to the habaki.  The lack of a facing metal piece to the habaki indicates poor workmanship.  It may all be modern, but the proof of the pudding for the blade will be when you take the handle off and see the tang.  Do this - remove the habaki and take good closeup photos of both sides of the tang and put them up.  The blade is the typical shape of a Meiji tourist piece, but running through the images again I&#39;m of the opinion that the koshirae is modern as it just does not have the refinement of shape that we expect to see in Japanese workmanship.  So the blade may be old, but if it does not have a clear and distinguishable hamon it is nonetheless a &quot;junk&quot; piece.\nRegards,\nBarry Thomas\n(Melbourne, Australia)\n\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: Patrik Danielsson \n  To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Thursday, November 27, 2008 8:27 AM\n  Subject: [nihontostudy] Question about a small Tanto or??\n\n\n  Hello everybody, i bought this small &quot;tanto&quot; on an ad here in Sweden.\n  Its feel really genunine, some kind of hard wood whith nice graining in saya and tsuka, on some places it looks like all the brass has been silverplated (can still se it above tha habaki on one of the photos), i have not been able to take the tsuka of it yet,but i gonna do that,(depending of the answers here :-)\n  Can this be a &quot;tourist&quot; thing , or is it made for a child , women or something like that?, if someone have some info age or something i will really happy.\n\n  The blade from grip (above habaki) to tip is 6.5 inches / 17 cm, and the total is 10 inches/ 25.5 cm.\n\n  Here is some pictures of it:\n\n  http://s74.photobucket.com/albums/i248/wellcraftantiqua/japan/\n\n  Thanks alot\n\n  Patrik \n  . \n   \n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
