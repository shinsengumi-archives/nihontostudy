I have a tsuba that confirms one of his points exactly- a late \nmuromachi/momoyama tosho plate that got dressed up later w/ a gold \nmimi and gold and shakudo mons- it did paper at a previous shinsa \n(72 pts) to &quot;Mid-Edo Shoami&quot;.  Had the soft-metal work not been of \nvery good quality it certainly would have scored lower and I can \nonly guess at what it would have done had the plate been unaltered.\nCheers,\nKirk\n\n--- In nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Jim Gilbert&quot; &lt;jggilbert@E...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; Milt and Rich,\n&gt; Later inlay is a case by case judgment.  Because the originality \nof the tsuba is compromised, there will usually be a significant \npoint reduction for later inlay to a good, older iron plate.  If the \ninlay is extensive it will probably fail.   If it is an attempt \nto &quot;convert&quot; the tsuba to a different type (even if mumei), or is \nvery crude or done after the Edo period, it will fail.\n&gt; \n&gt; A hypothetical good Muromachi period Tosho guard with a subtle mon \ninlaid during the Edo period would probably pass, but with a much \nlower point level that the unaltered plate would have been awarded.  \nAlso, if there is significant alteration to the piece, the date \ngiven will be that of the latest work.\n&gt; \n&gt; Most of the late gomoku zogan, mukade, etc., will fail for poor \nquality.  Maybe an exceptional example could pass, but I can&#39;t think \nof any examples.  Does anyone have one of these guards with an \norigami? \n&gt; \n&gt; My observations only, not endorsed by anyone.\n&gt; Jim\n&gt; \n&gt;   &gt; Jim,\n&gt;   &gt;  While making copies for the Chicago shinsa,I notice an iron \ntsuba \n&gt;   &gt; got the pinkie ........reason given was the inlays were added \nlater.\n&gt;   &gt; Why is that ?  I mean if the soft metal inlays were added in \nthe Edo \n&gt;   &gt; days, it was &quot; fashionable &quot; then and not meant to deceive .\n&gt;   &gt; I recall that tsuba was a mumei.\n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   Very interested in the reply here. Seems to me a lot of\n&gt;   very good tsuba had inlay which were later applications.\n&gt;   Ko-Nara, Heianjo, etc commonly used Saotome tsuba as\n&gt;   starting points. Also most of the gomoku zogan and mukade\n&gt;   styles, the inlay or wire is a later addition. I&#39;m sure\n&gt;   many other examples could be cited. Does that\n&gt;   mean none of those are eligible for papers?\n&gt; \n&gt;   Rich S\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
