These, at first glance look very large, just by their own dimensions. There is a Sukashi Katchushi Tsuba with the famous chrysanthemum design that is from the Nambokucho period. The size of the Nakago Ana and the hitsu and kozuka ana give the impression that the tsube would be roughly 4 &quot; or something like that across, it looks huge. ( the pic is on page 9 if anyone has it )This leeds me to more questions. \n\nWere Nakago that much smaller ( width and depth not length ) in the earlier periods than say the late Koto, early Shinto eras ?, giving the impression of bigger tsuba, or were the tsuba just bigger in some cases ?. \n\nIn most thing&#39;s we find, bigger is better, that is our way as collectors. All things being equal,  bigger swords are generally worth more than smallers ones. The same seems to apply to tsuba. Would that same mentality applied to the owners of these swords when they first had them made ?. Bigger looks better, show&#39;s greater wealth, looks more menacing ?\n\nDuring the waring periods when swinging a sword in battle was maybe a daily excersise, would a larger Tsuba have offered more protection, than a smaller tsuba ? or was it maybe a phycological advantage that the wielder had.\n\ncheers all\n\nRich \n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
