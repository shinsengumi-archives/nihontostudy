Liverpool Museum has mounts of identical type in its\n&gt; inventory.\n&gt;\n&gt; The mystery of the beveled saya has also now been answered by Steve. The\n&gt; bevel is because the Wak was part of a daisho the katana would also have a\n&gt; bevel so the two sit tightly together in the belt. This also confirms the\n&gt; blade was carried by a Samurai!\n&gt;\n&gt; http://www.c.farrar.btinternet.co.uk/wak/Dscf0073.jpg\n&gt;\n&gt; Peter\n&gt;\n&gt;   _____\n&gt;\n&gt; From: Jim Gilbert [mailto:jggilbert@...]\n&gt; Sent: 12 March 2004 03:49\n&gt; To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: Re: [nihontostudy] Wakizashi Help\n&gt;\n&gt; Peter,\n&gt; The original metal fittings appear to be a set by one maker or at least a\n&gt; single workshop.  I think that they could be work from Shonai in northern\n&gt; Honshu.  Is the fuchi or tsuba signed?  The kozuka is a later substitution\n&gt; of lower quality.  I can&#39;t really see the menuki in the photos.  The\nkashira\n&gt; appears to be of a different material.  I&#39;m guessing that it may have been\n&gt; lost and that the tsuka has been rewrapped, but I can&#39;t see much in the\n&gt; photos.\n&gt;\n&gt; The bevel on the saya would be up against the body when the sword was worn\n&gt; so it&#39;s probably not just for show.  My guess is that it might be more\n&gt; comfortable to wear or would help position it somehow (?).  It&#39;s an\nunusual\n&gt; feature.  Does anyone know what it&#39;s called or what it is really for?\n&gt;\n&gt; As a lone wakizashi it could have been worn by a non-samurai, but I don&#39;t\n&gt; see anything about the koshirae that would make that necessarily so.\n&gt;\n&gt; Jim\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   Hi,\n&gt;\n&gt;   Can anyone assist me with this Wakizashi? I&#39;m after more information on\n&gt; the\n&gt;   style and school of the mounts. I was told that due to the style of the\n&gt;   mounts it would have been a merchants or high class civilian&#39;s sword.\nCan\n&gt;   anyone confirm or deny this?\n&gt;   The grove cut into the saya does look to be a kind of fashion statement.\n&gt; The\n&gt;   blade is out of polish but looks to have a gunome hamon.\n&gt;\n&gt;   http://www.c.farrar.btinternet.co.uk/wak/\n&gt;\n&gt;   Thanks for any assistance anyone can offer!\n&gt;\n&gt;   Peter\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   _____\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
