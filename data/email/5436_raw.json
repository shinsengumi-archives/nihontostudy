It figures!\n\nI am trying to raise funds a wee bit on the fast side. I&#39;ve listed my Oei Bizen Morokage (2 sets of Yoshikawa NTHK papers, sashikomi polish supposedly by Kentaro Yoshikawa) with Darcy at:   www.nihonto.ca\n\nDirect link:  http://www.nihonto.ca/morokage/index.html\n\nclick through the link and see all the photos. The photos are not the best because I did not send the sword to Darcy for photographs. It is a very beautiful and elegant sword.\n\n****   Price is listed at $8500 but I will cut it to ____$7500_____ and if others want to make me counter offers in the next 2 weeks, I will consider them.  I&#39;ve turned down offers at $7,500 before- but special circumstances rule for now. ****\n\nPlease contact me off list if interested.\n\nCurran\n\n\n\n      \n\n"
