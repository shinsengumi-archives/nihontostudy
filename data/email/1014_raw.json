Thanks.  There are much better examples including some that show areas of what appear to be the original surface and very nicely done hirazogan (no doubt revealed only after very careful cleaning).  \n\nSome years ago John Badenhop had a museum journal in Japanese that showed these guards being cleaned with a plasma etching technique.  The chemistry was presumably chosen to etch the rust while having some reasonable selectivity to the unoxidized iron and the inlay.  I only got a quick look, so I don&#39;t know the details.  \n\nHere&#39;s a soft metal example, too:  http://home.earthlink.net/~jggilbert/irogane.htm\n\nand some more fuzzy photos from pieces in museums:  \n\nhttp://home.earthlink.net/~jggilbert/kofun2.htm\nhttp://home.earthlink.net/~jggilbert/kofun.htm\n\nSome of the blades of this period also show extensive inlay in silver and sometimes gold.  Some of these sat unrecognized for years before they were cleaned sufficiently to reveal the inlay.  &quot;Windows on the Japanese Past: Studies in Archaeology and Prehistory&quot; has an article or two on these swords as I recall.  There&#39;s even a piece there by some guy named Bleed, although not sword related.\n\nJim\n\n\n\n  agreed Jim, even in this one condition, it is pretty cool, that is like app 1200 years old, amazing. Is that one on your page in your collection ?, it is excellent.\n\n  Rich\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
