It looks like shipping weight when packaged will be 4 lbs. I&#39;d prefer using priority mail (uninsured) or if wanted, media mail (but with insurance) can also be done. What I&#39;d suggest is anyone wanting a copy from me should email me direct with your address and if you want the copy shipped priority or the slower media mail. I&#39;ll get back to you with final cost. (Catalogue costs $50 plus shipping; $4.38 insured media mail or a few bucks more, priority.)\n\nThe 2nd Kokusai Tosogu Kai convention exhibition was held in Tokyo several weeks ago. It was a super exhibit of super fittings and koshirae held at the Takashimaya Department Store exhibition area in Tokyo. This year&#39;s catalogue is wonderful, being hard bound with slip cover and illustrations in color of high quality printing. I&#39;ll try to post some photos of the catalogue somewhere later this week but honestly, the catalogue, especially at this price, is well worth your hard earned cash! \n\nWhat I&#39;d suggest is that anyone outside of the U.S.A. should buy a copy locally. They are available from members outside of the states. \n\nIf you&#39;re interested in a copy email me direct: swords@... and give me your address. Specify if you want priority or media mail shipping and I&#39;ll quickly get back to you with the total cost including shipping. These are sold &quot;at cost.&quot; \n\nRon\nSTL\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
