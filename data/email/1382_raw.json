Minogame ? p343\nThe tortoise (Kame) of a=\r\n thousand years, one of the four supernatural \nanimals (Tiger, Dragon, Howo=\r\n, Tortoise) of Chinese mythology (the Kirin \ntakes sometimes the place of t=\r\nhe tiger). One of the tortoises presents \nsome of the features of the drago=\r\nn, generally the head, but the most \ncommon presentment of the sacred anima=\r\nl has a long tail, said to grow \nwhen it is over five hundred years old, an=\r\nd the origin of which is \nprobably due to the fact that tortoises kept in p=\r\nonds become covered \nwith a parasitic growth of vegetable origin the resemb=\r\nlance of which to \nthe Mino, or rain coat of peasants, was too irresistible=\r\n a chance of \npunning to be left unnoticed. The hairy tortoise is often sho=\r\nwn carrying \non its back a huge rock, with the three or more jewels or even=\r\n Mount \nHorai itself, perhaps as a modification of the Chinese custom to sh=\r\now \nthe tortoise as a pedestal for inscribed tablets, in itself a likely \nt=\r\nreatment of the Hindoo legend which places the world on the back of an \nele=\r\nphant, standing on a gigantic tortoise. The feet of the tortoise \nwere, acc=\r\nording to the Chinese, used to consolidate the world by the \nEmpress Jokwa =\r\n(q.v.) after Kung Kung had shattered the pillar of Heaven. \nThe tortoise is=\r\n emblematic of longevity, and as such found as one of the \nconstant attribu=\r\ntes of Fukurokujin, Jurojin, and the various legendary \npatriarchs, Sennins=\r\n, or other personages who were endowed with \nparticularly long spans of ear=\r\nthly existence, See Emblems, Koan, \nUrashima, Monkey.\nA blind minogame, wit=\r\nh an eye instead of navel x x x x , dwells at the \nbottom of the sea. It ca=\r\nn never see the sun but every three thousand \nyears, when it rises to the s=\r\nurface, and even then it must find on the \nwaves a plank with a hole in it,=\r\n place its eye over the hole and await \nsome friendly gust of wind to turn =\r\nupside down both tortoise and board. \nThis Buddhist parable from the Hoke R=\r\nyo has passed into a proverb \napplied to unlikely events. The story is give=\r\nn in Ehon Hokan, IV., 23, \nin which are also found the story of the monkey =\r\nand the tortoise, and of \nthe tortoise and the two cranes. A minogame whose=\r\n pond was drying up \nfast, begged two cranes to take her to some other lake=\r\n, and they tried \nto do so by means of a reed, which both cranes held in th=\r\neir bills, and \nto which the tortoise hung by her jaws; but the minogame wi=\r\nshed to speak \nwhilst in mid air, and it dropped to the ground where it die=\r\nd, (H., 22). \nSee Umi Bozu.\nThe terrapin is another tortoise which has its =\r\nplace among proverbs. \nTsuki ni Suppon means: =1CThe moon is not the only r=\r\nound thing,=1D and is \noften illustrated. One sees sometimes a drawing of o=\r\nne or two tortoises \ndangling from a string above the parapet of a bridge, =\r\nthis represents \nthe small tortoises sold by pedlars, and which people buy =\r\nto liberate in \nponds. This custom is called Hojoye, or sitting free: and t=\r\nhe \ntortoise-sellers adopt as a mark the characters x x Hanashi Kame: \n=1Ct=\r\nortoises to be let loose.=1D\n\n-- \nDavid McDonald                  Collector=\r\n of Japanese Swords and Old Iron \nPO Box 265                      WEB page =\r\n- http://www.montanairon.com \nSidney MT  59270                email - jswor=\r\nds@... \n406-482-3243  evenings          I do tsukamaki (wrapping of swo=\r\nrd hilts) \n\nOwner of White IH Cub & Super A Farmall, IH 100 & 130, 140, AC =\r\nG  \nMcD type M, Monitor, Frost King and other stationary engines. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
