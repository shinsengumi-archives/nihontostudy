I have to\n&gt; agree with chris this is looking more like a Shinshin-to =\r\npiece and\n&gt; based on the few photos we have a Satsuma piece. He is thinking=\r\n of\n&gt; Jigen Ryu and the profile of this tsuka certainly fits their\n&gt; standa=\r\nrds, the small tsuba as well. The saya is a bit of an enigma\n&gt; since there =\r\nappear to be no other fittings which might have provided\n&gt; some confirmatio=\r\nn of that idea.\n&gt; \tI will agree with Barry as well the size and length of t=\r\nhe\n&gt; blade, the deep hamachi and mune-machi, the ubu-ba that you report,  \n=\r\n&gt; the mottled\n&gt; colour of the nakago and the presence of a shinobi-ana all =\r\nsuggest\n&gt; later manufacture. So Shinshin-to it is.\n&gt; \tThis is some find, an=\r\nd I would love to see more photos when you&#39;ve  \n&gt; the chance.

Th=\r\ne tsuba is 16th  \n&gt;&gt; century Tachi-kanagushi work lacquered red and may be =\r\noriginal to  \n&gt;&gt; the mounting.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; The blade is too discoloured to see an=\r\ny details but it has ububa of  \n&gt;&gt; 7&quot; and the edge side of the habaki has a=\r\n slot cut into it to allow  \n&gt;&gt; for this.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I assume this is the first =\r\nof a group of similarly mounted weapons  \n&gt;&gt; ordered by a clan or Temple. I=\r\n think that the sword has been kept  \n&gt;&gt; in storage for a very long time as=\r\n it is not for everyday use,  \n&gt;&gt; weighing around 6lbs and is 4&#39;7&quot; long ove=\r\nrall and is in mostly good  \n&gt;&gt; condition but with worm holes in the leathe=\r\nr bound tsuka\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I would like to know if anyone on the list has seen a s=\r\nimilarly  \n&gt;&gt; mounted nagamaki, the black sam=E9 and red lacquered binding =\r\nare  \n&gt;&gt; distinctive. I would like to know where it came from.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I have=\r\n uploaded images at:\n&gt;&gt; http://www.esnips.com/web/TsubaFittings\n&gt;&gt; --^^----=\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;&gt; This email w=\r\nas sent to: toryu@...\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; EASY UNSUBSCRIBE click here: http://t=\r\nopica.com/u/?b1dP6L.cjLeMJ.dG9yeXVA\n&gt;&gt; Or send an email to: token_kenkyu_ka=\r\ni-unsubscribe@...\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; For Topica&#39;s complete suite of email marketi=\r\nng solutions visit:\n&gt;&gt; http://www.topica.com/?p=3DTEXFOOTER\n&gt;&gt; --^^--------=\r\n-------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;\n\n\n\n[Non-text port=\r\nions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
