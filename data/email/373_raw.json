Toppei I believe refers to the\n&gt; shape of the kashira and kojiri IE; tapering. I agree with all that\n&gt; Jim has said, I believe these were popular at the tail end of the Edo\n&gt; period when Western weapons and tactics were being fervently studied\n&gt; by the Japanese.\n&gt;       This style of koshirae could be used with hakama or European\n&gt; trousers, hence the swivel often seen. The swivelling &quot;kurikata&quot;\n&gt; allowed the sword to be thrust thru the Obi or slung &quot;backward&quot; in\n&gt; western fashion when dressed in pants.\n&gt;       The gunto koshirae is an extension of this idea and one can\n&gt; see how many different ways were invented to allow quick conversion\n&gt; from saber to uchigatana...\n&gt;       More often than not these are of superior workmanship. My\n&gt; belief is that the new officers of the newly formed rifle or\n&gt; artillery units went for this style and most of them with the money\n&gt; to get a special set up like this were likely sons of the Bakufu.\n&gt; There is one memorable example of this style which is decidedly\n&gt; common, showing rough simple work suitable more for a foot soldier\n&gt; than an officer; That would be Saigo Takamoris&#39; shuzaya toppei\n&gt; goshirae which carried a gimei Muramasa blade.\n&gt;       I think this little tanto exhibits all the features of a\n&gt; quality koshirae in this style. There is one more feature not yet\n&gt; mentioned and that is that Toppei koshirae typically feature iron\n&gt; fittings with silver inlay (sometimes gold).\n&gt;       That really is all I know (or have been taught).
