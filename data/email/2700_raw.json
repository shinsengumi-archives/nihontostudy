I just found this study group and joined up and \n&gt; while I am sure that everyone who was kind enough to already help me \n&gt; belongs to this group I was hoping that perhaps some additional \n&gt; input might be derived from within this membership.  \n\n&gt; I have put together a small group of pictures of a sword that I \n&gt; frankly am unqualified to provide an opinion or an valuation of.  \n&gt; The mune is about 1/4&quot; wide for about 7&#39; then tapers down to about \n&gt; 1/8th&quot;. The shinogi in the tapered area appears to be wider than \n&gt; that however. I would appreciate any information one could possibly \n&gt; provide to me.\n&gt; Regards\n&gt; Tom \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&gt; Yahoo! Groups Links\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYahoo!
