Be aware that there are guards that show admixtures of style, for example Kyo-Owari blend.  Those 50/50 mixes can be frustrating, but I don&#39;t know that we&#39;ll ever unravel them short of some extensive metallurgical survey.\n\nPersonally, I don&#39;t see Higo or Umetada in it.  Usually Kyo-Shoami is used to describe guards done in marubori and/or nunome zogan.  A straight iron sukashi guard would normally be described as Shoami, or if pre-Edo period as Ko-Shoami.  Don&#39;t be discouraged by the Shoami tag.  Good Shoami guards will have nice activity in the rim.  \n\nThe guard is what it is independent of the label.\n\nJim\n\n\n\n  Rich & Jim,\n\n  I originally thought Kyo shoami. I bought it as such.\n  Size is 70mm x 75mm x 5mm thick. About 3.5 thick at\n  seppa dai.\n\n  Sure feels Higo in the hand and working with the iron.\n  Darker than evident in this Florida sun drenched\n  photo. Nagged me that it had something relaxed about\n  it like an Umetada piece, but didn&#39;t think it typical\n  of them.\n\n  As I said, my original thoughts were kyo-shoami. I\n  bought this one off photos, and it proved to be more\n  than I anticipated. So much going on in the mimi.\n\n  Too many confusing characteristics. From the photos I\n  totally understand a &#39;shoami&#39; call. In hand, I don&#39;t\n  know. Doesn&#39;t feel shoami. Thought someone might name\n  a semi-obscure sidechool that might be a better fit.\n\n  Curran\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
