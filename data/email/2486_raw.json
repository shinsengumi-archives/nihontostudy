Anyone know what I&#39;m dealing with here?\n&gt;\n&gt;Signature looks like Masanori to me. Can someone identify who he is\n&gt;exactly? \n&gt;\n&gt;http://www.nihonto.ca/fittings.html\n&gt;\n&gt;The material is silver. There is a kao on the tsuba and a signature on\n&gt;the fuchi, and the styles do match. There is a kojiri on this saya as\n&gt;well, along with a fuchi and koiguchi that are all done in the same\n&gt;style. It&#39;s very nice, all pieces are silver.\n&gt;\n&gt;Anyone have recommendations about the care and feeding of silver\n&gt;fittings (Jim?). I&#39;m guessing leave it alone and don&#39;t touch it.\n&gt;\n&gt;The patina on silver is caused unfortunately by sulphur in the air,\n&gt;which is a product of the industrial revolution. Black Tarnish (silver\n&gt;sulfide) is not a native and normal patina for old silver in the days\n&gt;when it was made... it&#39;s pretty uneven on the tsuba as can be seen, and\n&gt;the kashira is also kind of rough.\n&gt;\n&gt;I do want to know though if there is a proper care procedure if someone\n&gt;does know. As well, I&#39;d like to submit this koshirae for papers and\n&gt;want to make sure I&#39;m doing everything right.\n&gt;\n&gt;- darcy\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;Yahoo!
