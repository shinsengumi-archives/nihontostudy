John\n\n\n\n\n--- In nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com, &quot;David Zincavage&quot; &lt;jdz@=\r\n...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Barry,\n&gt; \n&gt; I just remembered that we never finished discu=\r\nssing that great Ko \nKinko tsuba with the Kasugane motif. \n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m particu=\r\nlarly fond of the deer. I&#39;ve added to the photo on the \nweb-page an illustr=\r\nation from a book on Paleolithic art, describing \nthe same combination of p=\r\nerspectives we see in the deer on the \ntsuba.  This very ancient approach t=\r\no perspective is not \nnaturalistic in the way we are normally accustomed to=\r\n seeing, but I \nthink, in the case of this tsuba, it very successfully comm=\r\nunicates \nthe kind of imperfect image of deer we receive, looking from a \nd=\r\nistance in less than optimum light at moving animals. \n&gt; \n&gt; I think the imp=\r\nerfection of the perspective makes this tsuba more \nexciting than a it woul=\r\nd be if it featured a much more literally \nmodeled image.  And the archaic =\r\nquality, the comparative roughness \nof the representation of the deer, on t=\r\nhe elegant kinko background \nis more dramatic by the virtue of the extreme =\r\ncontrast between image \nand background.             \n&gt;     \n&gt; \n&gt; http://zin=\r\ncavage.org/KoKinkoKasugane.htm\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; David Zincavage\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   ----- O=\r\nriginal Message ----- \n&gt;   From: Barry Thomas \n&gt;   To: nihontostudy@yahoogr=\r\noups.com \n&gt;   Sent: Monday, April 17, 2006 12:13 PM\n&gt;   Subject: Re: [nihon=\r\ntostudy] Re: in defense of the ugly bird or \nseeking more &quot; punishment &quot;\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt;   I have followed this discussion with great interest and will \nhave =\r\nto go over it\n&gt;   again I&#39;m sure, but I clearly see what Milt is talking ab=\r\nout.  \nTo find a stiffer\n&gt;   deer one would have to go to the tundra...\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt;   I recall well a tsuba that I found many years ago.  It was a \nsmall, co=\r\npper\n&gt;   sanmai awase (if I correctly remember a phrase I haven&#39;t uttered \n=\r\nfor 15 or more\n&gt;   years!) with a touch of silver (tin??) showing stylised =\r\n\n(stamped?) waves with a\n&gt;   creature on it that I always thought was an &quot;o=\r\nver-endowed \nrabbit&quot;, but Bob\n&gt;   Haynes told me was a fox!!  I wrote to Bo=\r\nb when I saw a similar \ntsuba in one of\n&gt;   his catalogues.  I was amazed w=\r\nhen he said this was a very early \nstyle of tsuba\n&gt;   ca 1300 - 1400.  I ha=\r\nd it for years, often looking at it and \nsaying &quot;Do I like\n&gt;   it, or do I =\r\nnot??&quot;  Same thing with this deer kinko.  I have \ngazed at Pete\n&gt;   Klein&#39;s=\r\n image on yahoo (I actually have the Lundren Collection \nbook, but it&#39;s\n&gt;  =\r\n out on loan to a &#39;kinko&#39; mate) for a long time on this sleepless \nnight, a=\r\nnd I\n&gt;   ask myself the same question all over again.  So David Z, if I \nco=\r\nuld ask you a\n&gt;   question, when you say &quot;I don&#39;t collect kinko at all,  bu=\r\nt this \nis one of a\n&gt;   small number of cases which, granted a opportunity,=\r\n would lead \nme to alter my\n&gt;   policy&quot; I have to ask you &quot;WHY??&quot;  Please e=\r\nxplain.\n&gt; \n&gt;   If I found this very tsuba I would think it was junk.  I don=\r\n&#39;t \nhave to tell you\n&gt;   why.  Or do I??  The design spilling into the sepp=\r\nadai I have \nonly seen on tsuba\n&gt;   I didn&#39;t care for.  The wobbly surface =\r\nand incredibly bad nanako \nwould kill it\n&gt;   for me.  And the stiff deer do=\r\nesn&#39;t do anything for me at all.  \nHowever, I would\n&gt;   look at the larger =\r\nthan usual kozuka ana and opine &quot;Hmmm, maybe \nit&#39;s early&quot;.\n&gt;   Back to my q=\r\nuestion to myself &quot;Do I like it, or do I not&quot;.  If I \ndon&#39;t like it,\n&gt;   I =\r\ndon&#39;t collect it, no matter what the aesthetes say.\n&gt; \n&gt;   Now, this puts m=\r\ne into the rustic class, I know, but there is a \npoint to this\n&gt;   that is =\r\nnot all derisory or derogatory.  It is this.  It is easy \nto pick\n&gt;   excel=\r\nlent work amongst Edo period tsuba , even in the iron &quot;wabi-\nsabi&quot; class,\n&gt;=\r\n   but the archaic styles, the transition between (if we might say) \nconcep=\r\ntual\n&gt;   forerunners and the refined later schools is much, much more \ndiff=\r\nicult.  Or is\n&gt;   it??  Recall here Milt&#39;s hawk tsuba that lead to the pres=\r\nent \ndiscussion.  And I\n&gt;   can show you a tsuba that a well-educated (tsub=\r\na knowledge) mate \nof mine\n&gt;   dismissed as &quot;late, possibly 1920s&quot;.  It is =\r\na masterwork of late \nEdo/early Meiji\n&gt;   and belongs to a friend of mine. =\r\n If he gives permission I&#39;ll \nput up some images\n&gt;   of it.\n&gt; \n&gt;   So, to b=\r\nring this to a close, are there any others inhabiting \nthe same closet as\n&gt;=\r\n   I???  I know I&#39;m lacking an ability, an aesthetic if you like, \nto appre=\r\nciate the\n&gt;   stiff deer kinko in question and it worries me.  It seems \nwi=\r\nthout thorough study\n&gt;   and training many tsuba in this time frame would i=\r\nndeed be \nconsidered junk and\n&gt;   sold off, possibly to an ignominious fate=\r\n.  The other kinko that \nPete shows in\n&gt;   two images at the same link does=\r\n &quot;speak to me&quot;.  It is from the \nsame time frame\n&gt;   and I find it elegant =\r\nand refined and would collect it.  I think \nthis discussion\n&gt;   parallels t=\r\nhe Sue Koto kazuuchimono line of thinking with \nblades - I don&#39;t\n&gt;   collec=\r\nt those either...\n&gt; \n&gt;   Barry Thomas\n&gt;   (Melbourne, Australia)\n&gt; \n&gt;   ---=\r\n-- Original Message -----\n&gt;   From: &quot;klepet33319&quot; &lt;Ppeterdds@...&gt;\n&gt;   To: &lt;=\r\nnihontostudy@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt;   Sent: Monday, April 17, 2006 5:50 AM\n&gt;   =\r\nSubject: [nihontostudy] Re: in defense of the ugly bird or \nseeking more &quot;\n=\r\n&gt;   punishment &quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   Link to scan &#39;deer&#39; tsuba from Lundgren collecti=\r\non:\n&gt; \n&gt;   http://ph.groups.yahoo.com/group/nihontostudy/photos/view/7936?\n=\r\nb=3D3\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   SPONSORED LINKS Buy fine art  Japanese translation  Japanes=\r\ne \nincense  \n&gt;         Fine art inkjet paper  Fine art printing  Fine art \n=\r\nappraisal  \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; -------------------------------------------------------=\r\n------------\n-----------\n&gt;   YAHOO!
