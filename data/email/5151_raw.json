I am sorry to have missed Mike&#39;s presentation on Machibori-mono.\n \nIn response to your call for reference material, two titles that come to\nmind are:\nTOSOGU MACHIBORI MEIHIN SHUSEI (FUKUSHI, 2005)\nSTUDIES IN KYO GOTO (Kasahara/Akimoto, 1988)\nThe former was the companion volume to Fukishi&#39;s 2001 Goto survey, and\nthe latter focuses on the 15 branch families of mainline Goto.  See\nhttp://www.satcho.com/july2007 for more detail on both.\n\nYour call to distinguish between schools sounds like a fascinating point\nof departure for an in depth study.  Next we all look forward to your\nthoughts on the subject, perhaps Hartmann (2008).\n \n \nKind Regards,\n\n\n\nMichael Harris \n \nsatcho.com\nhttp://www.satcho.com &lt;http://www.satcho.com/&gt;   Specialists in books\nrelated to the study & appreciation of the Japanese sword as art. \n \nA sponsor of the NihontoCalendar http://nihontocalendar.org\n&lt;http://nihontocalendar.org/&gt;   The calendar of Japanese sword club\nmeetings and events around the world that may be set as your home page.\nIt includes a search engine, world clocks, currency converter, daily\nworld news from top syndicated providers such as CNN and BBC. \n_______________________________________________\n \n \n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: token_kenkyu_kai-owner@...\n[mailto:token_kenkyu_kai-owner@...] On Behalf Of Ron Hartmann\nSent: Thursday, August 23, 2007 7:27 PM\nTo: TOKEN; nihontostudy; nihonto@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: Kogai study...\n \n  Kogai rank right after first ranked menuki when it comes to tosogu but\nafter all these decades of trying to learn, I&#39;ve found it very difficult\nto gain much understand kogai. Obviously, the best way to learn is by\nstudying examples with peers, but those opportunities seldom present\nthemselves, especially here in the midwest. This dilemma presented\nitself again since the San Francisco show. Naturally, one thinks &quot;Goto&quot;\nwhen it comes to fine kogai, but of course there were many other makers\nto consider. Mike Yamasaki&#39;s Machibori display touched upon that.\nRemarking on a particular kogai exhibited by Mike, I commented that if\nthe item had not been identified as one of the artists considered a\nmachibori smith, I would had thought it Goto work! Mike pointed out that\nno, that this is wrong and that is wrong for Goto. How great it would be\nto sit down at length with good &quot;examples&quot; and with somebody of\nknowledge to compare and point out these kantei differences! &quot;Bits and\npieces&quot; can be learned at shows, but that&#39;s about it. \n \n  My question to the groups is: what sources of information have you\nfound to be really useful -- teachable material -- that helped you\nunderstand kogai and to differenciate between the different schools who\nmade kogai. I have a good library after all these years, but it is\nsurprising what little information is here that helps. Certainly, good\nphotos exist (mostly on Goto works) but there must be some material out\nthere in publication that &quot;compares&quot; the work of different groups,\npointing out the differences. How great it must be to be in Japan or\nCalifornia or New York and to have opportunities to do this with real\nexamples!!! Any suggestions for those of us living outside of those\nareas? \n \nRon\nSTL\n \n  \n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
