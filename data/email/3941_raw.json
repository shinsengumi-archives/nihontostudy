These are excellent photo&#39;s and an invaluable help. \n  If I may, how would you classify this ?.\n\n  The condition is down a bit ( as are the photo&#39;s sorry ). I bought it as \n  Muromachi Owari, then got it and thought it might be Kanayama. There is \n  a long large ( rope ) bone in the mimi, and quite a few smaller normal \n  bumpy bones. There are also small bones in the hira, running around the \n  mimi. I have not been able to pin the theme either, besides the ginger \n  leaves.\n\n  Any clues appreciated.\n\n  http://www.nihontomessageboard.com/personal/owari-hira.jpg\n\n  http://www.nihontomessageboard.com/personal/owari-mimi.jpg\n\n\n  best wishes\n\n  Rich\n\n  Jim Gilbert wrote:\n  &gt; Ken,\n  &gt; I photographed some Kanayama tekkotsu and posted them here:\n  &gt;\n  &gt; http://ph.groups.yahoo.com/group/nihontostudy/photos/browse/d4b0\n  &gt;\n  &gt; Hopefully it will make things more rather than less clear.  It&#39;s difficult to capture the whole package in a few photos.\n  &gt;\n  &gt; JIm\n  &gt;\n  &gt;\n  &gt;\n  &gt;\n  &gt;   Jim,\n  &gt;\n  &gt;   While I am reading kantei #2 and becoming familiar\n  &gt;   with the groups people are talking about, you didn&#39;t\n  &gt;   give me a chance to ask a question back on #1.  Is it\n  &gt;   possible to get picture of the tekkotsu from kanayama\n  &gt;   for comparison?  I am visual, there is a dirty joke in\n  &gt;   there, and that would really help sink it into the\n  &gt;   brain.\n  &gt;\n  &gt;   Very interesting all of this.  I have lots of books I\n  &gt;   just purchased and several months of reading.  Just\n  &gt;   have to finish the sword section of the boston museum\n  &gt;   and I&#39;m into 4 or 5 tsuba books.  Hopefully, I can\n  &gt;   start to get a handle on some of this.  So I wouldn&#39;t\n  &gt;   even begin to give an answer.  \n  &gt;\n  &gt;   Thanks again.\n  &gt;   Ken\n  &gt;\n  &gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n  &gt;\n  &gt;\n  &gt;\n  &gt;  \n  &gt; Yahoo!
