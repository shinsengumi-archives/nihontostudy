I\n  know this probably sounds stupid, but\n  I&#39;ve studied several other languages in the past (grade school, high\n  school, etc.,), and it seemed to be a\n  fairly drawn out/painful affair, and I was debatin&#39; whether to just sign\n  up for a course at the local college or what...\n\n  thanks,\n\n  rkg\n  (Richard George)\n\n\n\n        Yahoo!
