Your teacher it  \nseems has done something similar in pursuit of her idea of perfect  \nform. Most anyone here would not put in a bohi for practice or to  \nremove a flaw without serious study and long consideration. A skilled  \nman could probably put in a hi that was difficult to detect as ato- \nbori. However many of us here have seen good hi cut on old swords and  \nhave learned to look for them as a sign of age or worse; hidden  \nflaws. If the sword came in shirasaya someone thought enough of it to  \ntry to preserve it as is.\n\tYou asked for opinions and we would recommend that you not alter the  \nsword without more study, more study of swords, and more study of  \nswordsmanship. Batto-do is destructive no matter how good the  \nswordsman one should never cut with antique swords. Iaido believe it  \nor not is destructive, constant practice dulls blades, scuffs  \npolishes and eats up koshirae. Trust me I know. Restoring a sword  \nthat has been practised with can be a tricky process, one where fatal  \nflaws may come to light. Someone restored it once, polished it once  \nand put it in shirasaya for protection once, long ago. The hand of  \nour elders is apparent in that saya listen to what it is telling you.\n\tIn two years time you may find you prefer a longer sword or a  \nheavier sword or one with deeper curve. Some folks take ten years or  \nmore before they settle on the style of blade that best suits their  \npractise. Practise hard but proceed with caution you&#39;ll be glad you did.\nThomas C Helm\n6 Dan Muso Jiki Den Eishin Ryu\n\n"
