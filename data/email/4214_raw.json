Among th=\r\ne new toys I bought from the Big Guy is a signed Goto \nschool single fuchi =\r\nwith a peacock motif which matches exactly my \nother mumei fuchi...so now I=\r\n am quite positive the other unsigned \npiece is of the Goto school.\n\nDid se=\r\ne a few &quot; big money &quot; changed hands so there&#39;s some &quot; actions &quot; \ngoing on t=\r\nhere .\n\nAs usual Jim gave an excellent presentation/discussion  on what mak=\r\ne \na good tsuba.  I,  being my usual self with the big mouth , actually \nha=\r\ns the audacity to say a tsuba &quot; turned me off &quot;......with \nstrange/interest=\r\ning result !!  Jim did mention there&#39;s no right or \nwrong answer regarding =\r\nthe tsuba so i figure why not......\n\nBenson&#39;s tsuba price is very very reas=\r\nonable at the show but too bad \nI dropped all my $ at Hagrid&#39;s.\n\nThe best p=\r\nart of the show is still touching bases with old friends, \ntelling the same=\r\n ole stale jokes and seeing everyone is still alive \nand kicking........\nPe=\r\nrfect weather throughout and to cap the day, i get to spot the \nresident re=\r\nd tail hawk&#39;s nest and see the magificient bird flying and \ndoing well.\nFor=\r\n more detail and insightful report............ that you have to \nwait till =\r\nBarry gets home.\n\nMilt\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
