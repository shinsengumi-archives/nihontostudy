Having this name carved on the blade as it is,\n&gt; would this indicate the sword had some association with this shrine or\n&gt; perhaps that the Owner had some association with this shrine?\n\nAll of the swords that were on display at one of the shrines I visited\nhad a dedication of some sort carved into the blade. Some were very\ncrude, most of them made me wince &quot;why do this to a good blade!&quot; It&#39;s\npossible that some were well done but after having sword TLC hammered\ninto my head from day one, from my point of view I couldn&#39;t consider it\nas anything other than vandalism (read: this is my bias, and I know it&#39;s\na bias :-).\n\nIt is possible that your sword was dedicated to the shrine in question\nand then un-dedicated by a serviceman or something.\n\n- darcy\n\n\n\n\n"
