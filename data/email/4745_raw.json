A new supply has come in and are now available. To simplify shipping, I decided to make these available to U.S. addresses at $65 post paid shipped priority mail. (Arrival probably in time for Christmas, in case any wives or sweeties are reading this.)\n\nPayment by Paypal to my account (Ron Hartmann -swords@...) is easy, or send me a check at: 5907 Deerwood Drive, St. Louis, MO 63123-2707. \n\nAnyone outside the U.S.A. can hopefully get them from a nearby KTK member. Those members on the List could make this known. (If must be, I can figure shipping outside the states but that&#39;s usually expensive and kind of a pain at the post office.)\n\nHere is a brief review of the catalogue by a Pete Klein (from a copy supplied by KTK member Richard Turner...\n\nhttp://tinyurl.com/y4el2e\n\nAny further question, email me privately and I&#39;ll try to answer them. When this group sells, I&#39;ll fade off into the sunset...\n\nRon\nSTL\n\n\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
