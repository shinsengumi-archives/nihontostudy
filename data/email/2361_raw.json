I have a lot of books on Japanese Swords, but\nnone of them have much on Tsubas.  I have a whole list of Books that Jim had up on his website,\nwhich I&#39;m trying to find out how to get some of them.  What books are really good and where can I\nget them?\n\nAlso, I purchased a set of Tsuba&#39;s from a Local Auction House in Portland, Oregon and need to find\ninfo on them.  Can we send the photos on this list, or do I need to put them up on my website and\nput a hyperlink to them?\n\nThank you,\nKim\n\n\n\t\t\n_______________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nExpress yourself with Y!
