This year&#39;s exhibition was on &quot; Yamato blades &quot;.  Also \nthere was a tsuba exihition on Kyo-sukashi tsuba.\n \nEven though the attendance was noticably lower than previous years, I \nnoticed a heightened level of activities among dealers, \ncollectors/table holders. A lot of horse tradings took place to \neveryone&#39;s advantage.   I personally sold   quite a few tsuba und \ndone a few trades which I am very happy with. There&#39;s no last minutes \nfirehouse sales as the prices were set quite low to begin with, so if \nyou have cash, many good deals were possible.\nA fellow listeros had a great display of his personal collection of \nChristian theme tsuba................ simply OUTSTANDING !!!!!!!! he \ncorned the market on that theme !!!!!\n \nRoy H. had a display of an outstanding  tachi koshirae that used to \nbelong to gen. Sugiyama und a very nice display of HIGH QUALITY tauba \n( among them  a Hoan tsuba that made some people hyperventilate ).... \nin short, a mini Meibutsu room display  right there in the room for \nall to see through out the show.\nIf you are in the Mid West region und missed the \nevent................. arrrrrrhhhhhh, you missed a great  show.\n \nA great event is already being planned for next year but since it&#39;s \nin the planning stage, i can&#39;t tell you what it is.  Stay \ntuned...........................\n \nmilt\n\n\n"
