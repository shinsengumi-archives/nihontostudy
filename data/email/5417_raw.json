To post photos you need to go to &quot;photos&quot; at the bottom of these emails and post them there, then direct everyone to your &quot;file&quot; once you open a file. Any photos sent as attachments will not make it through, as attachements are deleted. \n\nAlways interesting to hear how these swords came into the hands of today&#39;s caretakers. It sounds as if what your father brought home might be more than just mass produced &quot;weapons,&quot; being mounted as you described. Do you know how to remove the handles to look for any maker&#39;s signature? I&#39;m sure somebody here will instruct you on a few &quot;care&quot; pointers, etc. \n\nRon\nSTL\n\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: cehlers1949 \n  To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Monday, May 12, 2008 1:27 PM\n  Subject: [nihontostudy] New Member\n\n\n  I just wanted to say Hi and that I am glad I found this group. My father died not long ago \n  and left two samurai swords which are now in my possession. He acquired them in Papua \n  New Guinea after the battle of Buna. One is in a plain brown storage case and the other is in \n  a pebbled case with a leather cover. I hope, over time, to discover all that I can about them. \n  As my father never talked about his 4 years of fighting in the Pacific theatre, these are the \n  only link that my siblings and I have to his time there. We hope that as we learn more about \n  these swords, we will also learn about those times and the valorous men who fought on both \n  sides. I won&#39;t have expertise to share, but look forward to learning a great deal from all of \n  you. Is it permissible to post photos on this site?\n\n  Chris\n\n\n\n   \n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
