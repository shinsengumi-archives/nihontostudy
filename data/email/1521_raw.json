The Norisuke working in the 19th C produced tekkotsu at will and in their copies sometimes exaggerated them beyond what was in the originals.  Good Kanayama work is still more attractive, but how much of that is because of raw material vs. technique vs. intent?\n\nIt&#39;s quite possible that Kanayama guards simply went out of style.  The aesthetic trend in the Edo period moved away from the tastes of the Muromachi and Momoyama in paintings, ceramics, etc., as well as sword fittings. \nJim\n\n\n\n  Gang, how much truth is there to the theory that the Kanayama tsuba\n  makers used a &#39;special secret iron ore known only the them and probably\n  close to where they worked&#39; that produced the wonderful tekkotsu effects\n  in their tsuba? And that when the when they ran out of this particular\n  iron ore the school ceased to exist?\n\n  Matt\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
