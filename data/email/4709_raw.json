One of the infrequent \nsensei from Japan set the whole thing up. The job did not detract from \nthe beauty of the sword. I do not plan to destroy the sword it is way \ntoo valuable, I&#39;m only toying with the idea at the moment.\nEnore\nGordon Robson wrote:\n&gt; Hi Enore,\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt; Are you talking about taking an antique sword and cutting a groove in it? I\n&gt; hope not. There is no one I know of in Japan who would do that. And I think\n&gt; you would be hard pressed to find someone who would even do it to a newly\n&gt; made blade. The sword comes as it is and anything added later is typically\n&gt; not seen as a good thing.\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt; Gordon\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com [mailto:nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com] On\n&gt; Behalf Of egardonio\n&gt; Sent: Wednesday, December 06, 2006 2:28 AM\n&gt; To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: [nihontostudy] Bo-hi\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt; Hello everybody, I&#39;m new to this forum so if I make an error please\n&gt; remember that. Has anybody had the experience, or do you know, of\n&gt; having a Bo-hi done to a Nihonto?\n&gt; For example, does one have to send the nihonto to Japan or can the job\n&gt; be done in North America.\n&gt; Thanks for any information\n&gt; Enore\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt; Yahoo!
