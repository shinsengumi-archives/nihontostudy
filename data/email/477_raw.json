The pair \nsymbolizes\n&gt; the best/strongest.  The pairing of lion and peony is a Chinese \nconcept,\n&gt; and the design is still seen today among Chinese works of \nart/craft.  The\n&gt; peony was brought to Japan from Tang China as medicine, and the \nflower\n&gt; became popular among Heian court nobles.  Stylized botan flower \nbecame\n&gt; popular design motif, including the &quot;mon&quot; crest, by the Kamakura \nperiod.  A\n&gt; branch of the Genji clan in Settsu Province used a &quot;mon&quot; showing \nshishi and\n&gt; botan around that period (ca. 1300), so the pairing has been in \nJapan for\n&gt; some time.  \n&gt; \n&gt; The botan/shishi pair was (still is?) also a popular irezumi \n(tattoo) motif\n&gt; among the yakuza (gangsters).\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Best,\n&gt; \n&gt; Mike Yamaguchi\n\n\n"
