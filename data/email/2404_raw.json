I went to the Sothebys sale, but as I \nwanted to bid on one of the lots I had to miss the viewing. The sale was \nwell attended, with\n  quite a few Japanese dealers and I was told some from Taiwan as \nwell.There were I believe some Americans,  Europeans and the usual \nsuspects from the UK.\n  Prices were mostly over estimate so no doubt Neil Davey who was \nconducting the auction was well pleased. I left after some sixty lots \nhad passed because\n  I wanted to see the swords at Christies. I looked at about thirty five \nof the best swords but after that I had to stop. My eyes could not take \nin any more. You can only\n  really look at a small number at any one time. I came to the conclusion \nthat I would be happy to take home perhaps five of the swords, the rest, \nsome big names among\n  them, were not for me. You will know that at the sale prices went \nthrough the roof, but I am still not convinced that a number of the \nswords were correct. I was also\n  interested to see Caldwell&#39;s well known Ko Mino tsuba. It was much \nbetter in the hand than in the pictures I have seen of it, and I liked \nit very much. I have always\n  doubted though that it was Ko Mino, and as it sold for just over a \nthousand I guess that the Japanese doubted it as well. Ko kinko perhaps? \nMy friend is still ill so\n  our discussions were limited but he thought that the kyo attribution of \nour tsuba was more than likely correct. My own thoughts still linger on \nShoami but in the best\n  Japanese tradition I bow before the pronouncement of the Sensei.\n\n  Kind regards,  Charles.\nOn Wednesday, November 10, 2004, at 04:49 PM, David Zincavage wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt; http://tinyurl.com/5xyum\n&gt;\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
