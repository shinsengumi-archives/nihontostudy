I&#39;m a newbiy here so I thought I might introduce \nmyself a little. My name is Leroy and I live in Northern California. \nI have been doing my best to read as much as I can about Nihonto. I \nthink I am ready to purchase on, and now I would like some opinions. \n\nI was wondering what you would choose. I found 3 swords that I like \nand are about in my price range; One was made in 1977, one in the \n1930&#39;s (papered-NBTHK) and another in the 1860&#39;s (papered-NBTHK).\n\nOf those with more experience, which would you choose? The one from \nthe 1860&#39;s does have some light rust, the others are in full polish. \nThe dealers are reputable.\n\nAny help would be much appreciated. Thanks in advance.\n\nLeroy\n\n\n\n\n"
