Although cast-iron \ncannon became avai=\r\nlable ca 1550, these were much more difficult to \ncast, and bronze remained=\r\n the metal of choice until the mid to late \nC17.  Since the &#39;De Liefde&#39; arr=\r\nived in Kyushu in 1600, is it not highly \nlikely that its cannon were of br=\r\nonze rather than of iron?\n\nIs there an expert on cannon out there somewhere=\r\n who can clarify this \npoint for me?\n\nRegards, John L.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In nihonto=\r\nstudy@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Barry Thomas&quot; &lt;warlord@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; All,\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;=\r\nve just discovered this little gem about the history of Namban \ntetsu (fore=\r\nign steel) in Japanese history and the involvement of the \nDutch V.O.C.
