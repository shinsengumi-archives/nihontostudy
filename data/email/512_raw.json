The beginning Japanese text was translated in the second installment.  I don&#39;t know if they are going to publish a bound version when it is complete.  When I joined the club I was able to purchase several years of back issues of the NL for a reasonable fee, so you may want to ask about that.  I think it&#39;s worth buying all of the old issues you can get, since there&#39;s always some interesting fittings information there.\n\nJim\n\n\n\n  Thanks Jim, that&#39;s all great stuff, I wonder if the book may have copies made by the same person, it is hard to reproduce identical drawing in this style of ink work each time. Regardless, it is a really nice book to have, as a member of the NCJSC I can keep an eye on the tsuba and start a catalogue for it, do you know if they translated the text sections as well ?, or if they are publishing the book when finished ?. I came in late on this in my membership and am a bit behind.\n\n  cheers mate\n\n  Rich\n    ----- Original Message ----- \n    From: Jim Gilbert \n    To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n    Sent: Tuesday, July 08, 2003 8:06 AM\n    Subject: Re: [nihontostudy] Tsuba book\n\n\n    Rich,\n\n    It&#39;s Toban Shokan Koketsu.  It&#39;s a copy of an Edo period manuscript.  Joly&#39;s version of the same MS is called Toban Shinpin Zukan.  I don&#39;t have &quot;TSZ,&quot; but I have made a limited comparison of my copy of your book with the version of TSZ that Haynes and Harvie are reprinting in the Northern California club newsletter.  The numbering is different, but so far I&#39;ve found the same guards in each and the text section appears to be the same.  The drawings however are not identical even though they illustrate the same guards, so they appear to be based on different hand copies of an older MS.\n\n    I think that one of the comments in the Haynes/Harvie reprint in To Ron mentioned that a certain guard was a classic Higo design, even though the seppa dai was narrow like Kyo rather than the usual Higo shape.  The same tsuba in my book had a normal, typical wider Higo seppa dai.  A different brush hand at work.\n\n    It wasn&#39;t unusual for there to be multiple hand copied manuscripts made from an original, and no doubt copies were made of the copies.  Maybe someone has more specific details on history behind these two books.\n    Jim\n\n\n    ---\n    Outgoing mail is certified Virus Free.\n    Checked by AVG anti-virus system (http://www.grisoft.com).\n    Version: 6.0.493 / Virus Database: 292 - Release Date: 25/06/2003\n\n\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n        Yahoo!
