I&#39;ll decide\nwhether to track down and buy the book. This suba not\nbeing signed, I doubt few other than a very confident\njudge would give it *definitely* to Norisuke. But I\nhope you find a dead ringer of a match for me.\n\nA good number of people have told me they are skipping\nSan Fran this year for a variety of reasons. I am too,\ndue to business.\n\nIf you make it to Tampa in 2007, feel free to drive\ndown and fish off our dock. Snook is tasty. Right up\ntheir with nice scottish rainbow trout.\n\nCurran\n\n\n\n--- Ron Hartmann &lt;swords@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; Hi Curran - \n&gt; \n&gt; Sorry for the delay in responding but things have\n&gt; been busy around here -- no, not &quot;sword&quot; busy,\n&gt; unfortunately! I&#39;ve yet to look through that book\n&gt; for your tsuba but will make a point to do so\n&gt; tomorrow (or later tonight). \n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m not &quot;married&quot; this book but I&#39;ve just recently\n&gt; purchased a Namban book (Japanese) so honestly, I\n&gt; don&#39;t need another. My book came from a Japanese\n&gt; dealer but I can look and see what I paid for it and\n&gt; let you know, in case you&#39;re interested. I&#39;ll check\n&gt; and let you know, okay?\n&gt; \n&gt; Skipping SF this August -- (sigh) -- since I&#39;m going\n&gt; to Japan in October. It will feel good to stay home\n&gt; for 2-1/2 months after a short (fishing) trip south\n&gt; of St. Louis next week.

It is\n&gt;   &gt; very\n&gt;   &gt; heavy. The gold wire used is also very heavy\n&gt;   &gt; guage,\n&gt;   &gt; set extremely deep into channels. It has\n&gt; retained\n&gt;   &gt; about 99.9% of the inlay, but there is a small\n&gt;   &gt; spot on\n&gt;   &gt; the mimi where I can see how deep the channels\n&gt; run\n&gt;   &gt; and\n&gt;   &gt; the gold wire extends all the way into it.\n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; According to Haynes and one or two other\n&gt; sources,\n&gt;   &gt; the\n&gt;   &gt; Norisuke line did work in Kinko sometimes.\n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; I am not saying with 100% certainty that this is\n&gt; a\n&gt;   &gt; Norisuke, but there is a similar tsuba out there\n&gt;   &gt; by\n&gt;   &gt; Norisuke and the more that I look at other tsuba\n&gt;   &gt; by\n&gt;   &gt; the Norisuke family, the more I see the same\n&gt;   &gt; design\n&gt;   &gt; elements over and over again. Leaf shape. Flower\n&gt;   &gt; petal\n&gt;   &gt; engraving. Flower engraving. General\n&gt; composition.\n&gt;   &gt; Very\n&gt;   &gt; much like a painting, the great number of\n&gt; details\n&gt;   &gt; evident in a soft metal heavily carved piece\n&gt; like\n&gt;   &gt; this\n&gt;   &gt; seem to me a signature. There is some variation,\n&gt;   &gt; like\n&gt;   &gt; there is a very similar 1st gen Norisuke example\n&gt;   &gt; with\n&gt;   &gt; near identical leaves, but the main vein of the\n&gt;   &gt; leaf\n&gt;   &gt; is done in a single track of gold vs the double\n&gt;   &gt; vein I\n&gt;   &gt; have on this leaf.\n&gt;   &gt; I like to figure things out before I submit them\n&gt;   &gt; to\n&gt;   &gt; shinsa, and sometimes if I am happy enough with\n&gt; an\n&gt;   &gt; answer and intend to keep a piece- I don&#39;t\n&gt; submit\n&gt;   &gt; to\n&gt;   &gt; shinsa. I&#39;d be surprised if I actually got a\n&gt;   &gt; &#39;Norisuke&#39; call on this, but as a\n&gt;   &gt; newbie-intermediate\n&gt;   &gt; having something like this seem to click into\n&gt;   &gt; place\n&gt;   &gt; has been very satisfying. Yet I may be\n&gt; absolutely\n&gt;   &gt; wrong! So if I can stand on someone&#39;s shoulder\n&gt; and\n&gt;   &gt; see\n&gt;   &gt; further into this.... I welcome the view.\n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; If you want to take a crack at the other tsuba\n&gt;   &gt; that\n&gt;   &gt; has been a challenge for me, I will dig that\n&gt; photo\n&gt;   &gt; out\n&gt;   &gt; too and post it. This &#39;Norisuke&#39; has been the\n&gt; more\n&gt;   &gt; interesting piece and horribly difficult to\n&gt;   &gt; photograph\n&gt;   &gt; given the highly reflective shakudo and gold.\n&gt;   &gt; Photography is not a strong skill for me, yet\n&gt; the\n&gt;   &gt; devil of a good identification is also in the\n&gt;   &gt; detail\n&gt;   &gt; of the other one.\n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; Curran\n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; --- Alan Bale &lt;abale@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; &gt; Is the tsuba iron or shakudo?
