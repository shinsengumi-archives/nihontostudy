I can allready tell it&#39;s going to be very educational. I went\n&gt; to all the lectures - the Kodogu & Tsuba lectures (by Gilbert &\n&gt; Robson) were the best. Benson lectured on Bizen swords and I was able\n&gt; to admire and study 5 of them.\n&gt;\n&gt; This is my second time to attend this show. I decided to have my own\n&gt; table and actually sold some of the wonderful Tsuba that I own (I own\n&gt; too many!). I was very glad to meet Robert Haynes. He is so happy to\n&gt; answer any and all questions that anyone ask&#39;s. I ask him plenty and\n&gt; was educated in the process.\n&gt;\n&gt; The only head-ache occured coming and going at the SF airport. I had\n&gt; a Security Weapon case to carry 2 swords - allmost lost, repeatedly\n&gt; searched, I could go on and on.\n&gt;\n&gt; I have a question..........What is the web-site address for the NTHK?\n&gt; I am contemplating joining. I hear they have a good &#39;novice&#39; course\n&gt; about Nihonto.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; Elliott\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
