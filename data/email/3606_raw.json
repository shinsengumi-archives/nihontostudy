Most are $200 range, more or less. If you are new at this I would be happy to recommend good ones that would help teach you about these things. Some of these have been to a number of shows and are now kept home so that I can keep my table at the shows, fresh. All are authentic, for sure. The shows seem to have a wonderful selection of nice quality tsuba these days and that is good for the buyer, bad for the seller since there is such a &quot;selection&quot; to pick from. Anyway...just thought I&#39;d toss this idea out to you. I&#39;ve been around for going on 40 years...gosh, that&#39;s a little frightening to put in writing! \n\nRon\nSTL\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: anwahi \n  To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Wednesday, December 21, 2005 4:23 PM\n  Subject: [nihontostudy] Where do you buy your Tsuba?\n\n\n  Hello,\n\n  I&#39;m new here and to collecting Tsuba. Where do you buy your Tsuba from? \n  I know there&#39;s several websites you can find with a Google search, an \n  occasional Token Kai show like the one in SF, or Ebay (most look like \n  junk). I&#39;m looking for good sources of authentic Tsuba. Obviously the \n  only way to be really sure of authenticity is to purchase papered \n  Tsuba, but because I&#39;m starting off I want some sources of authentic \n  Tsuba more reasonably priced. Any suggestions?\n\n  Thanks for your helpo in advance,\n  Anthony\n\n\n\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  YAHOO! GROUPS LINKS \n\n    a..
