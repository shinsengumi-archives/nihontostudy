They are stylised clouds with possibly a highly abstract cloud dragon around the centre of the fuchi.  It isn&#39;t clear enough to see.  I think these are quite nice and have a Higo look to them???\n\nRegards,\nBarry Thomas.\n\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: BECKY WALLACE \n  To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Wednesday, January 03, 2007 11:58 AM\n  Subject: Re: [nihontostudy] Re: Fwd: Can anyone ID this tsuba?\n\n\n  I have posted the requested pictures. Hope they help. I also did as a friend of mine at work suggested and performed a rubbing on the tang. The character that looked like a Y now looks like a Y with a &quot;n&quot; attached to the bottom right side. I tried to draw it in Power Point - I think I captured the gist of it, but the arms of the Y aren&#39;t crooked like my left side is. I think I&#39;ve seen this character before. Later if I have time, I&#39;ll try and scan the rubbing so you can see what I actually see, but for now I have to run.\n\n  Becky\n\n  Curran Campbell &lt;neobliviscar@...&gt; wrote:\n  Becky,\n\n  Happy New Year!\n  I&#39;d agree with John, Barry, and Rich. My interest is\n  in fittings, so I agree with Barry in that the fuchi\n  (and probably the kashira too) looks interesting. We&#39;d\n  love to see more photographs, if possible. Just be\n  gentle with the tsuka (handle), but don&#39;t be afraid of\n  it.\n\n  The nakago (tang) of the sword isn&#39;t signed, but does\n  hold some promise at first glance. If you can take a\n  whole shot of the nakago, it would be most beneficial\n  to the sword guys on the list.\n  Is Harry Watson on this list? Any chance you will\n  be in Dallas this year at the gunshow she mentioned?\n\n  Curran\n  . \n   \n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
