My maxim is not to\n&gt; buy anything I cannot hold in\n&gt; &gt;my hand and judge for myself.  There are far too\n&gt; many subtleties to do otherwise\n&gt; &gt;on my very limited budget.  If I were a rich man it\n&gt; would be a slightly\n&gt; &gt;different story, but that&#39;s the way of the world. \n&gt; Fittings are a little better\n&gt; &gt;judged from GOOD photos, but from a description\n&gt; such as yours one can only\n&gt; &gt;comment in the most general of terms in essay\n&gt; format, which in practice amount\n&gt; &gt;to nothing that would really help you.  The best\n&gt; way to learn is to buy and make\n&gt; &gt;mistakes - you WILL make mistakes, I can guarantee\n&gt; that.  So, yes, please give a\n&gt; &gt;link to what you seek an opinion on.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Barry Thomas.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;----- Original Message -----\n&gt; &gt;From: &quot;Kim Ghobrial&quot; &lt;imports@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt;To: &lt;nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; &gt;Sent: Saturday, July 09, 2005 11:11 AM\n&gt; &gt;Subject: Re: [nihontostudy] RE: Question....\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Hey all,\n&gt; &gt;I&#39;m not sure what is going on, but every time I\n&gt; send something or reply\n&gt; &gt;to someone, I don&#39;t get any response from anyone. \n&gt; I kind of feel like I\n&gt; &gt;and my posts are invisible to everyone.  The other\n&gt; lists that I&#39;m on, I\n&gt; &gt;get some type of response from someone, and I don&#39;t\n&gt; feel like I&#39;m\n&gt; &gt;ignored.  If someone doesn&#39;t know, I would like to\n&gt; know this, if I need\n&gt; &gt;to get Photos let me know, but don&#39;t ignore the\n&gt; questions.  There are a\n&gt; &gt;lot of folks on this list which has expertise in\n&gt; parts of swords or full\n&gt; &gt;swords and then there are folks, like myself which\n&gt; are learning from\n&gt; &gt;asking questions and listening to the answers.  I\n&gt; don&#39;t have tons of\n&gt; &gt;money for expensive books, what books I do have, do\n&gt; not cover areas\n&gt; &gt;which I&#39;m asking questions about.  So, please, if\n&gt; someone asks a\n&gt; &gt;question, please acknowledge it, even if it is an\n&gt; answer like, &quot;I don&#39;t\n&gt; &gt;know the answer.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;In the case of the question below, would it help in\n&gt; getting a photo of\n&gt; &gt;the pieces and putting it up on this list for all\n&gt; of you to see?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Sincerely,\n&gt; &gt;Kim\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Kim Ghobrial wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Hi Everyone,\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Sorry to ask this, but I was looking at an\n&gt; Auction, which I&#39;m going to\n&gt; &gt;&gt;see tomorrow and wanted to know if this is\n&gt; something for me to look at\n&gt; &gt;&gt;or not.
