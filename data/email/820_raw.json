Now to save up for that \nhuge goto book. I saw one on Robert benson&#39;s site and also I think \nSatcho&#39;s site. I look forward to digging in!\n  Does any museums have goto fittings in the US other than the Boston \nmuseum? \n Thanks, LB\n\n\n\n--- In nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Ron Hartmann&quot; &lt;swords@u...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; Curran - \n&gt; \n&gt; Rick and Dan are both &quot;as good as they come&quot; and true &quot;students&quot; of \nGoto works and of the sword. Rick is the treasurer of the newly formed \nAmerican branch of the NBTHK. Neither one participate on these \ndiscussion/chat groups. I have not checked the NCJSC&#39;s web site in \nawhile but it wouldn&#39;t surprise me to see some of these or some other \nequally fine kodogu pictured there. \n&gt; \n&gt; Quality made photographs are great but to see this quality of work a \nfew inches from one&#39;s eyes, in the &quot;flesh,&quot; is something else! This \nbrings to mind a really fine tsuba I once owned signed Natsuo. It was \ngood and Bob Haynes agreed, but also added that it would never &quot;pass&quot; \nin Japan. A couple years later I was at the Boston MFA and for the \nfirst time I saw a &quot;real&quot; Natsuo work and immediately, I recognized \nthat my wonderful tsuba simply did not at all have the quality that \nradiated from that &quot;real&quot; Natsuo. Same with mainline Goto works. That \n&quot;quality&quot; speaks for itself!\n&gt; \n&gt; Ron\n&gt; STL\n&gt; \n&gt;   ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt;   From: Curran Campbell \n&gt;   To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n&gt;   Sent: Monday, September 22, 2003 2:56 PM\n&gt;   Subject: Re: [nihontostudy] goto kodogu study\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   Ron-\n&gt; \n&gt;   Actually I took some time to study it. So many\n&gt;   exceptional pieces in such a small space. \n&gt; \n&gt;   Don&#39;t know if it was Rick or Dan I spoke with, but\n&gt;   they were nice to me as I pondered the hypnotic depth\n&gt;   of blackness in some of the menuki. I wrote down the\n&gt;   fellow&#39;s name, hoping to correspond further and get\n&gt;   some computer images if there were any to be had and\n&gt;   cataloged. Unfortunately the name/address got lost in\n&gt;   the paper shuffle of travelling back to the east\n&gt;   coast.\n&gt; \n&gt;   If there are any images of that display available,\n&gt;   someone please let me know. Coloration was beautiful\n&gt;   and the designs so much more full than can be done\n&gt;   justice in the Goto books I&#39;ve seen.\n&gt; \n&gt;   Curran\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   --- Ron Hartmann &lt;swords@u...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;   &gt; Lucien - \n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; I believe the NBTHK book by Fukushi Sensei is a very\n&gt;   &gt; large volume that came out a year or so ago. If\n&gt;   &gt; so--and I have a copy myself but have yet to really\n&gt;   &gt; &quot;get into it&quot;--it is pricey and (I believe)\n&gt;   &gt; out-of-print. The only book on Goto I had prior to\n&gt;   &gt; this large work was the one titled: The 17\n&gt;   &gt; Generations of Goto (Japanese text). I have this in\n&gt;   &gt; both hard cover and soft cover, I believe both being\n&gt;   &gt; the same inside the covers. It seems very good but\n&gt;   &gt; as always, so much is missed unless you can read\n&gt;   &gt; Japanese. \n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; Hopefully those who attended this year&#39;s San\n&gt;   &gt; Francisco show saw the small but significant display\n&gt;   &gt; of Goto fittings put on by Rick Mantigani and Dan\n&gt;   &gt; Burns. Absolutely awesome kodogu! Unbelievable crisp\n&gt;   &gt; and &quot;minty&quot; items of high, high quality makers! This\n&gt;   &gt; display has been shown the last few years but I\n&gt;   &gt; really wonder how many people stop to study the\n&gt;   &gt; treasures displayed. \n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; Some of these Goto fittings--and others--have been\n&gt;   &gt; included as special inserts (high quality photos and\n&gt;   &gt; printing) in the Northern California group&#39;s\n&gt;   &gt; newsletter from time to time. \n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; Ron\n&gt;   &gt; STL\n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt;   ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt;   &gt;   From: JapaneseSwords@a... \n&gt;   &gt;   To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n&gt;   &gt;   Sent: Sunday, September 21, 2003 4:12 PM\n&gt;   &gt;   Subject: Re: [nihontostudy] goto kodogu study\n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt;   Lucien,\n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt;   The best Goto book out there is Goto Book from\n&gt;   &gt; NBTHK By: Fukushi Sensei\n&gt;   &gt;   Another good book is SWORD FITTINGS BY THE FAMILY\n&gt;   &gt; OF GOTO  1440 - 1879 1994.  \n&gt;   &gt;   Sano Art Museum, Nezu Institute of Fine Arts,\n&gt;   &gt; Tokugawa Art Museum.\n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt;   I&#39;m sure that there are other books on Goto\n&gt;   &gt; fittings, but these two come to \n&gt;   &gt;   mind first.\n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt;   Lou\n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt;   [Non-text portions of this message have been\n&gt;   &gt; removed]\n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt;         Yahoo!
