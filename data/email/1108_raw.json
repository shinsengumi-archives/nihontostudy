I am not sure why this happens as I an not into\nmetallurgy. It is not due to ji-nie, because ji-nie is not common in such\nKyushu works - excepting the Samonji school. It is probably due to the type\nof sand iron available in Kyushu during the Koto period. This feature\ndisappears during the Shinto period due to changes in iron manufacturing and\nthe importation of foreign iron.\n\n \n\nGordon\n\n \n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Jim Gilbert [mailto:jggilbert@...] \nSent: Tuesday, November 18, 2003 3:26 PM\nTo: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: Re: [nihontostudy] Nihonto related questions, please help.\n\n \n\nThe wet look comes from profuse ji nie.  Early Soshu work like Yukimitsu and\nKunimitsu show it very well.  I also find them to be the most impressive\nblades.  The blue color is a different thing from the &quot;wet.&quot;\n\nYears ago I had a major house flood while away on vacation.  Some swords\nwere affected, but only a mediocre shinto blade rusted.  The koto under the\nsame conditions were not damaged at all, although the shirasaya were stained\nand had to be reglued.  Just a koto/shinto anecdote.\n\nJim\n\n\n\nThis is a stumper for me. I&#39;ve had a great Yukimitsu in my hands, and\ntwo great Shintogo Kunimitsu, and the overall feeling was this kind of\ngrey/white. The color seemed very pure, and these Shintogo were very\ngood and very healthy and the most perfect Nihonto that I&#39;ve seen.\n\nMy feeling at the time (and now) was that it was the kind of thing I\nwould expect to be carried by an angel.\n\nPut side by side with one that seemed filled with various blue colors,\nit was hard to tell the difference.\n\nI wonder if anyone has tried to do some spectral analysis.\n\nSometimes color can be some kind of low-grade oxidation.\n\n- darcy\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYahoo!
