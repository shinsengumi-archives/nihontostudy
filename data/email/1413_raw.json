But given the relatively small percentage of gold in even high quality shakudo, I doubt that it&#39;d be practical to do kantei by weight.  \n\nI&#39;m not sure how a copper alloy plate from Mino or decorated in Mino style would have a different weight from one of comparable size decorated somewhere else.  If anything, the deeply cut type of Mino-bori tsuba could tend to feel a little lighter than expected for its size due to the material removed.  \n\nFortunately kantei of Mino work by visual cues is pretty reliable.\nJim\n-------------------------------\nGang,\nAn advance collector told me the &quot; weight &quot; plays a part in the \nkantei too......... mino works are supposed to be &quot; heavy &quot;.\n\nJim et al, your thoughts on this ?\n\n\nMilt\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
