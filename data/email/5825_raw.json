The burglar will likely try to sell the stolen items.   \n&gt; So, please be on the look-out for any of the following items.\n&gt;\n&gt;  - Two Yasunori katana.  One was dated Showa 18, is an unusually  \n&gt; long 27 inches (the normal length is 26 inches, and is in Type 98  \n&gt; military mounts with family crests (mon).\n&gt;\n&gt;  - A Yasutoku katana dated Showa 15, is 26 and 1/4 inches long, and  \n&gt; is in Type 98 military mounts with family crests.\n&gt;\n&gt;  - An Awataguchi Tadatsuna wakizashi with a 21 inch cutting edge.\n&gt;\n&gt;  - A mounted Enju school katana approximately 30 inches long.\n&gt;\n&gt;  - A late World War II Type 44 green scabbard.\n&gt;\n&gt;  - A military gunto blade that was in the process of polishing.\n&gt;\n&gt;  - Three or four Type 98 military mounts with tsunagi (wood filler  \n&gt; blades).  One of the mounts, unusually, had copper fittings.\n&gt;\n&gt;  - A koto Morimitsu tachi approximately 28 inches long, ubu (the  \n&gt; tang has not been shortened).\n&gt;\n&gt;  - An unsigned koto Kamakura tachi with a hi (groove).\n&gt;\n&gt;  - Several gold-inlayed menuki.\n&gt;\n&gt; The burglary occurred on Monday June 13 at approximately 9:30 a.m.   \n&gt; The burglar was driving a navy blue pick-up truck.  Evidence  \n&gt; indicates the burglar was not knowledgeable about swords.  Again,  \n&gt; please be on the look-out for any of these items.  Also, please feel  \n&gt; free to forward this E-mail message to others who may see these  \n&gt; items for sale.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thank you,\n&gt; Wayne\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; _______________________________\n&gt;\n&gt; Wayne Shijo\n&gt; KD Anderson & Associates\n&gt; 3853 Taylor Road, Suite G\n&gt; Loomis, CA  95650\n&gt;\n&gt; Phone: 916/660-1555\n&gt; Fax:  916/660-1535\n&gt; Cell:  916/205-7032\n&gt; _______________________________\n&gt;\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
