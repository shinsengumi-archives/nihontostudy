(please email \nme privately)\n\n--- In nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Jim Gilbert&quot; &lt;jggilbert@E...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; Ron,\n&gt; For sideline Goto the best book I&#39;m aware of is &quot;Studies in Kyo \nGoto&quot; (Kyo\n&gt; Goto no Kenkyu) by Koju Kasahara and Shigeo Akimoto, 1988.  It is \nin English\n&gt; and Japanese.  The Seijo family chart shows one student of Seijo \nMasafuku\n&gt; (the 5th) and his name is Enomoto Kiyotsugu.  He later changed his \nname to\n&gt; Kiyohisa.  There are some other students of other generations \nlisted too.\n&gt; \n&gt; Jim\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Gentlemen:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I have a set of koshirae that appears to have been made by a \nstudent\n&gt; &gt; of Goto Seijo (5th). The student is not listed in the Kinko \nMeikan.\n&gt; &gt; (info from the Murtha fittings volume)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Is there any English language resource on the Goto artisans that\n&gt; &gt; would list genealogies, students etc. ?\n&gt; &gt; What is the best Japanese language resource on this kinko school?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Thanks!\n&gt; &gt; Ron P.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; &gt; nihontostudy-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Your use of Yahoo!
