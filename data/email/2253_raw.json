My Akasaka of this design signed\nTadashige (to my relief) passed shinsa in Chicago. Of course I have it\nhere in front of me now to compare the work with your tsuba. While the\ndesign is the same, the work on mine is more delicate (?)--more\npiercing--and seems to &quot;flow&quot; more, if you know what I mean. The\nhorse&#39;s hoofs on your tsuba are more &quot;squared&quot; and &quot;bold&quot; than the more\nnaturally shaped hoofs on my tsuba. I just saw a similar tsuba\n(picture) just the other day that showed these rather boldly made hoofs\nand it was called something other than Akasaka, but for the life of me\nI don&#39;t recall where I saw this. Thought it was in the new Mosle&#39;\ncatalogue, but if so, I&#39;m not finding it now. My tsuba came out of a\nlarge collection of tsuba sold in Santiago, Chile in 2003. That\ncollection also had another similar &quot;horse&quot; tsuba that had these large\nhoofs like your new tsuba, but I didn&#39;t buy that one. Most of these\n730-plus tsuba were bought up by Michael Zomber, so perhaps your&#39;s\ncould be the one I saw. I&#39;ll check my records. \n\nRon\nSTL\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: Richard Turner \n  To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Thursday, September 30, 2004 2:13 AM\n  Subject: [nihontostudy] Akasaka tsuba ?\n\n\n  All, I had a tsuba arrive today, it is a lot better in hand than the \n  original images I purchased it from showed. There are fine running\nbones \n  all the way around the mimi, I am thinking Akasaka. Here are some\npics. \n  Obviously modeled after Tadashige though there are a few Ito/Bush� \n  versions around as well.\n\n  Dimensions are 70mm x 68mm x 3mm\n\n  cheers all\n\n  Rich\n\n \nhttp://members.westnet.com.au/whiz/richard/pics/tsuba/Akasaka-Horse-front.jpg\n\n \nhttp://members.westnet.com.au/whiz/richard/pics/tsuba/Akasaka-Horse-back.jpg\n\n \nhttp://members.westnet.com.au/whiz/richard/pics/tsuba/Akasaka-Horse-detail.jpg\n\n\n\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n        Yahoo!
