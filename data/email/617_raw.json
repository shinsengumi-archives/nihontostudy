I re - did the color balance for the final photo \n(which I shot first),\n but this next photo (the tsuba with only the circular polarizer on) \nisn&#39;t quite right (it was\nshot last and I didn&#39;t redo the white balance after removing the \npolarizing sheet for the\nlight source).  You&#39;ll note the pics aren&#39;t up to my usual standard of \nsharpness either - I\nthink this is due to me opening up the f-stop (which reduces the depth of\nfield) and perhaps this camera suffers from the same autofocus errors \nthat some\nof the other canon cameras (notably the 10D) have...\n\nThat being said, this is a photo of the tsuba with only the circular \npolarizer on - note\nall the direct reflections:\n\nhttp://home.teleport.com/~rkg/misc/kagamishi_control_small.JPG\n\nthis final photo is with the polarizing sheet in place:\n\nhttp://home.teleport.com/~rkg/misc/kagamishi_all_polarized_small.JPG\n\nthe first thing to note is that most of those annoying reflections are \nmostly gone (!)\nthe second thing to notice is the couple of purplish distortions I think \nthese can be minimized\nor eliminated by moving the light further away and/or to a different \nlocation (just get it further out\nof the family of angles for the tsuba), or maybe a small gobo or \nsomething.  I think the white\nflash at the bottom was due to some  light getting around the polarizing \nsheet.  \n\nI also think its still a little underexposed (again, I was in a hurry,\nand kind of doinked the exposure/fstop until it looked about right in \nthe viewscreen...)\n(it would be really useful if Canon had actually allowed the user to \ncontrol all the camera&#39;s\nfeatures remotely with the software they provide).\n\nThis can be compared to a pic just using a polarizing filter and careful \nlight setup (and letting\nthe camera (which is usually smarter than I am) do the exposure stuff):\n\nhttp://home.teleport.com/~rkg/photos/tsuba/kagamishi_front_polarized_small.JPG\n\nand again, the above pic with the circular polarizer set to minimum \nglare reduction:\n\nhttp://home.teleport.com/~rkg/misc/kagamishi_front_non_polarized_small.JPG\n\nMy conclusion would be that the use of a circular polarizer to cut glare \nis a no-brainer,\nand that it appears that polarizing the source light has promise as \nwell, though I suspect\nthe big winner would be for trying to photograph swords, where its \nalmost impossible\nnot to get a big bloom of direct reflection off of something.  I&#39;ll \nprobably try that later\nthis weekend on my new tanto (its a wicked looking osoraku piece for \nthose who care...).\n\nrkg\n(Richard George)\n\n\n\n\n"
