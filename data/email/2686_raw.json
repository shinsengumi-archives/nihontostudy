My name is Leroy and I live in No=\r\nrthern California.\n&gt; I have been doing my best to read as much as I can abo=\r\nut Nihonto. I\n&gt; think I am ready to purchase on, and now I would like some =\r\nopinions.\n&gt;\n&gt; I was wondering what you would choose. I found 3 swords that =\r\nI like\n&gt; and are about in my price range; One was made in 1977, one in the\n=\r\n&gt; 1930&#39;s (papered-NBTHK) and another in the 1860&#39;s (papered-NBTHK).\n&gt;\n&gt; Of =\r\nthose with more experience, which would you choose? The one from\n&gt; the 1860=\r\n&#39;s does have some light rust, the others are in full polish.\n&gt; The dealers =\r\nare reputable.\n&gt;\n&gt; Any help would be much appreciated.
