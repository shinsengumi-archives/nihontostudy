The &#39;Bushido&#39; magazines \nfro=\r\nm Robert Benson (1980&#39;s) had a lot of great information, and the \n1976 Tai =\r\nKai from San Francisco book has a lot of information also (I \nbelieve there=\r\n&#39;s a copy at Bridge of Dreams).  They show up on Ebay \nfrom time to time al=\r\nso.\n     What I was referring to with the kozuka was the effect of \nremovin=\r\ng of gold revealing the substrate for effent, which you can \nsee better the=\r\nre than on the menuki where there is definatley wear \ninvolved also.  Ezo m=\r\nenuki were fabricated on a positive mould from \nthin copper sheet, then the=\r\n gold was applied using a mercury \ntechnique (probably heat evaporation), t=\r\nhen burnished with a needle \nto get the effect.  Uttori by definition is at=\r\ntachment of the inly \naround the edges only, although I would imagine there=\r\n is some form of \nburnishing or other form of adhesion involved as well.  A=\r\ns far as the \nwear to the menuki, hell, I hope I look that good when I&#39;m th=\r\nat old!\n\nPete\n\nPS:  I have a feeling they are older than Edo due to the pos=\r\nts both \nbeing open -- possibly Jim would know?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In nihontost=\r\nudy@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Barry Thomas&quot; &lt;warlord@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I have been a=\r\nware for a few years that the deliberate rubbing of \ngold to look\n&gt; worn is=\r\n a well-established part of the metal workers&#39; repetoire.  I \nbelieve it\n&gt; =\r\nis meant to impart an &quot;antique&quot; look, or maybe it&#39;s that &quot;wabi-\nsabi&quot; serpe=\r\nnt\n&gt; rearing its ugly head again.  Either way, if an item looks to be of \ng=\r\nood quality\n&gt; and in good condition AND the gold looks worn, then it is mor=\r\ne \nlikely to be a\n&gt; deliberate effect and original and NOT a &quot;condition pro=\r\nblem&quot;.  I \nwould sure like\n&gt; to know more about this.\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; \n&gt; Ba=\r\nrry Thomas.\n&gt; \n&gt; ----- Original Message -----\n&gt; From: &quot;bungotakadasword&quot; &lt;M=\r\nuramasaIII@...&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Tuesday, May 3=\r\n0, 2006 10:21 AM\n&gt; Subject: [nihontostudy] Re: Post dated Post Update (LOL)=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com, &quot;klepet33319&quot; &lt;Ppeterdds@&gt;\n&gt; =\r\nwrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; http://www.aoi-art.com/fittings/menuki/itaku04.html\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&quot; the color was toned with the technique called Suri-hagashi, \ncovered\n&gt; go=\r\nld was deliberately rubbed off. &quot;........\n&gt; \n&gt; this is interesting, sure it=\r\n&#39;s not &quot; condition problem &quot; ?
