I can envision perhaps a dozen examples of zogan \n&gt;tsuba, representative of where it began to be used through to the more \n&gt;common Kyo-zogan work of mid-Edo. It seems Jim, Alan Harvie and Bob Haynes \n&gt;did this at one of the SF shows two or three years ago. Perhaps such a \n&gt;&quot;comparison&quot; or &quot;evolution of the technique&quot; has already been put together? \n&gt;If so, it would be a wonderful article to see in print for sharing. \n&gt;Comments?\n&gt;\n&gt;Ron\n&gt;STL\n&gt;   ----- Original Message -----\n&gt;   From: Alan Bale\n&gt;   To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;   Sent: Sunday, April 24, 2005 1:58 PM\n&gt;   Subject: Re: [nihontostudy] yoshiro school tsuba?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   Ron, Barry,\n&gt;   When I said Kaga I meant Kaga-zogan and early, I don&#39;t think it is Kaga\n&gt;   Yoshiro, I don&#39;t have the image now so I can&#39;t check my first \n&gt;impression.\n&gt;\n&gt;   Alan\n&gt;\n&gt;   ----- Original Message -----\n&gt;   From: &quot;Ron Hartmann&quot; &lt;swords@...&gt;\n&gt;   To: &lt;nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt;   Sent: Saturday, April 23, 2005 9:15 PM\n&gt;   Subject: Re: [nihontostudy] yoshiro school tsuba?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   &gt;\n&gt;   &gt; Hi Alan -\n&gt;   &gt;\n&gt;   &gt; Sorry. When I said Kaga and the Yoshiro, I meant Kaga Yoshiro and the\n&gt;   Yoshiro of Kyoto area. (I think that&#39;s right, right?)\n&gt;   &gt;\n&gt;   &gt; When thinking Kaga Yoshiro, I&#39;ve had the impression that more often \n&gt;they\n&gt;   would have squarish-type hitsuana; these are conventional shape with the\n&gt;   kogai histsu being very &quot;rounded/drilled-like&quot; as you see on many of the\n&gt;   Kyo-sukashi tsuba. That was my thinking here. Not sure why, but I also\n&gt;   thought Kaga Yoshiro tsuba were more of a thinner plate than the others, \n&gt;but\n&gt;   I&#39;m not sure where that idea came from.\n&gt;   &gt;\n&gt;   &gt; Ron\n&gt;   &gt; STL\n&gt;   &gt;\n&gt;   &gt;   ----- Original Message -----\n&gt;   &gt;   From: Alan Bale\n&gt;   &gt;   To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;   &gt;   Sent: Saturday, April 23, 2005 3:04 PM\n&gt;   &gt;   Subject: Re: [nihontostudy] yoshiro school tsuba?\n&gt;   &gt;\n&gt;   &gt;\n&gt;   &gt;   It looks like Kaga to me, don&#39;t forget that you also divide Yoshiro \n&gt;into\n&gt;   &gt;   &#39;Kaga Yoshiro&#39; and &#39;Bizen Yoshiro&#39;.\n&gt;   &gt;\n&gt;   &gt;   Alan\n&gt;   &gt;\n&gt;   &gt;   ----- Original Message -----\n&gt;   &gt;   From: &quot;dirk marshall&quot; &lt;dirkmarshall@...&gt;\n&gt;   &gt;   To: &lt;nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt;   &gt;   Sent: Saturday, April 23, 2005 7:56 PM\n&gt;   &gt;   Subject: [nihontostudy] yoshiro school tsuba?\n&gt;   &gt;\n&gt;   &gt;\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt;\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt; I bought this with the other and got a good deal as they were \n&gt;rusty.\n&gt;   I\n&gt;   &gt;   was wondering if this could be a yoshino or kaga tsuba.
