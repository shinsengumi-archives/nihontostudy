I&#39;ve been trying to do \nresearch=\r\n on it and I&#39;m a little puzzled. The Tsuba has 4 or 5 \nswastikas (can&#39;t rem=\r\nember how many exactly) carved into the Tsuba. I \nfound out that swastikas =\r\nare buddhist symbols as well as what Hitler \nused them for. There are desig=\r\nns of painted fish on the scabbard as \nwell as the handle. Which are also b=\r\nuddhist symbols. Has anyone else \never seen Katanas decorated with swastika=\r\ns? I was just wondering if \nsomeone might have any background info. Any hel=\r\np would be great. \nPlease e-mail me back with any info.\n\n\n\n\n"
