Did swordsmiths, that made tsuba, sign any differently compared \nto their sword mei ?. Did that have different designations ?, or use \nalternate titles ?, and are there any records, i.e. references or books \nshowing Tosho tsuba mei ?.\n\nI have seen various mei on tsuba by Masahide, Naotsuna, Naokatasu and \nthey are close, though the papered Naokatsu I have seen show some \ndifferences. I have also recently come into possession of tsuba signed \nYasutsugu and Daido. I am looking at buying a Naokatsu tsuba when I am \nin Japan next month.\n\nSome of the greatest mid/late Edo sword smiths had a hand at making \ntsuba and it appears that they, for the most part, did an excellent job. \nI would be interested in any material, references and articles on this \nsubject. I have Roberts Haynes&#39; information in the Tsuba, an Aesthetic \nguide and Nihonto Koza but would also like to read anything else that \nmight be about the place.\n\nCheers\n\nRichard Turner\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
