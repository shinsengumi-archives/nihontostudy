On the =\r\nother hand, my\nmemory may just be faulty. We can also go back to Oda Nobuna=\r\nga for the\n=93foreign dress=94 thing. He is said to have had a Namban-gusok=\r\nu and his\nstandard was a Portuguese hat. He also affected foreign wear. Non=\r\netheless, I\nstill suspect that the importation of steel came after the Dutc=\r\nh were set up\nin Dejima, the country was pacified and smiths were largely e=\r\nstablished in\nlarge urban centers. That would put the use back past 1615 an=\r\nd the fall of\nOsaka castle. \n\n \n\nIt is interesting that Yasutsugu should be=\r\n negatively compared to Umetada\nMyoju in terms of blade making. Myoju left =\r\nscant numbers of swords and is\nreally not considered much of a sword-smith.=\r\n Horikawa Kunihiro is largely\ncredited with starting the Shinto tradition d=\r\nue to the large number of\nswords he produced and the size of his school, wh=\r\nich included the founders\nof the Osaka Shinto. Yasutsugu at his best is exc=\r\nellent, but he seems to\nhave produced a lot of so-so stuff.\n\n \n\nGordon\n\n \n\n=\r\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com [mailto:nihon=\r\ntostudy@yahoogroups.com] On\nBehalf Of Barry Thomas\nSent: Friday, February 2=\r\n3, 2007 9:50 AM\nTo: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: Re: [nihontostudy=\r\n] Re: NAMBAN TETSU\n\n \n\nJohn alerted us to the nihonto.com Yasutsugu article=\r\n, which stated:\n\n&gt; About this time, non oriental foreigners made \n&gt; their p=\r\nresence felt in Japan for the first time.

About this time \nYasutsugu was given the privilege of using the character=\r\n &quot;Yasu&quot; from \nTokugawa Ieyasu&#39;s name. Thus he changed his name to Yasutsugu=\r\n from \nthat point on. About the same time ( some feel it was a few years \nl=\r\nater) he was given the additional privilege of carving the Hollyhock \ncrest=\r\n ( Aoi mon) on his blades. These privileges were given in \nperpetuity to Ya=\r\nsutsugu and his descendents. Thus the Yasutsugu \nswordsmiths became the kaj=\r\ni of the Tokugawa Family.\n\nEarlier I raised the question of what made Yasut=\r\nsugu&#39;s fame and \nfortune seem to spread disproportionately to his skill whe=\r\nn we \ncompare him to some of his contemporary smiths such as Umetada Myoju =\r\n\nand Horikawa Kunihiro. About this time, non oriental foreigners made \nthei=\r\nr presence felt in Japan for the first time. Things from \nthe &quot;West&quot; were n=\r\new, exciting, strange, and highly sought after. \nYasutsugu was one of the f=\r\nirst advocates of using namban tetsu \n(foreign steel) in his swords. He pro=\r\nudly incised this fact on the \nnakago of his later works. It was new, it wa=\r\ns exciting, and there is \nno doubt that this use of foreign steel helped sp=\r\nread his fameis is \nfrom an article on nihonto.com\n\n--- In nihontostudy@ &lt;m=\r\nailto:nihontostudy%40yahoogroups.com&gt;\nyahoogroups.com, &quot;Alan Bale&quot; &lt;abale@.=\r\n..&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; To All,\n&gt; Yasutsugu 1st inscribed &#39;Nanban tetsu wo motte&#39; on=\r\n some of his \nswords, according to the Meikan his dated blades range from 1=\r\n613 to \n1621\n&gt; Alan\n. \n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been remov=\r\ned]\n\n \n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
