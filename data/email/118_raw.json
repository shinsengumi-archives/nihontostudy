I got to see one\nof those Hong Kong Crappers up close and personal. I had a new\nacquaintance make a 5 hour drive up from the southern part of the state\ntoday to meet and greet and share his new sword with me. A young man in\nhis late teens. He was lucky in the sense that he didn&#39;t pay for this\nsword, it was a gift, but someone bought it for him, mores the pity for\nthem. \nIt was decked out in what appeared to be standard gunto mount&#39;s that\nturned out to be very poorly made indeed. The blade really isn&#39;t worthy\nof mention, very poorly acid etched hamon, cheap old iron that had been\nground into shape. The mei looked like it was scratched out with a nail\nor something. It was so badly made I couldn&#39;t believe it. Still, he\nhangs it on his wall and enjoys it for what it is at the moment. \n\nHe want&#39;s to come to one of the local auctions later in the year. I\ndidn&#39;t have anything to show him as we met at my office but I said when\nhe sees something that is properly made he will understand more, for now\nhis cheap and nasty HKC can hang on his wall and he can dream of betters\nthings ahead. \n\nMaybe with luck, in a few month&#39;s time we will have another convert in\nour midst. \n\ncheers all \n\nRich T\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\nYahoo!
