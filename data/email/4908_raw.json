Thou=\r\nght I&#39;d ask if anyone knows of any factual articles \n  &gt; or simply some bac=\r\nkground information on those miniature &quot;Boys swords&quot; \n  &gt; that we sometimes=\r\n see from time to time. Some of these appear pretty \n  &gt; low-end quality wh=\r\nile on occasion, some real workmanship shows up.\n  &gt;\n  &gt; Personally, I&#39;ve n=\r\never had much interest in these but recently, a very \n  &gt; nice quality one =\r\nwas brought to me here in St. Louis by an antique \n  &gt; appraiser friend. No=\r\nw I own it. What impressed me was the nice quality \n  &gt; of the fittings, th=\r\ne baleen wrapping and a very handsome, well forged \n  &gt; blade. The blade ap=\r\npears to be signed Bizen Osafune Morimitsu and is \n  &gt; dated Oei 5 but more=\r\n likely, from what I&#39;ve gathered, it is more \n  &gt; likely a shinshinto creat=\r\nion made as a Morimitsu. Hamon is a narrow \n  &gt; suguha with ko-nei with a b=\r\noshi swept in ko-nie (hakikake). Bo hi and \n  &gt; an extended kissaki, male/f=\r\nemale mekugi with &quot;mellon&quot; crest. Quite a \n  &gt; nice &quot;package&quot; as we say.\n  =\r\n&gt;\n  &gt; I&#39;ve been told some of these were for export, but others were indeed =\r\n\n  &gt; made for presentation during coming-of-age. It would seem that \n  &gt; so=\r\nmebody would know more detail about these swords or perhaps know of \n  &gt; an=\r\n authoritative article on them somewhere.\n  &gt;\n  &gt; Ron\n  &gt; STL\n  &gt;\n  &gt; [Non-=\r\ntext portions of this message have been removed]\n  &gt;\n  &gt; \n\n  [Non-text port=\r\nions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n   \n\n[Non-text portions of this =\r\nmessage have been removed]\n\n\n"
