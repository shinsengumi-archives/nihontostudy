Realizing he copied Nobuie and seeing the super quality of this wonderful tsuba, I go along with the Nobuie call for it. (Sorry, Naokatsu san)\n\n  Interesting treatment of the very large/very small-ish hitsu-ana. I would find it interesting to read more comment on that particular feature &quot;in general.&quot; \n\n  Ron\n  STL\n    ----- Original Message ----- \n    From: Gordon Robson \n    To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n    Sent: Thursday, March 16, 2006 11:18 PM\n    Subject: Re: [nihontostudy] Re: tsuba kantei 3\n\n\n    Hi Jim,\n\n    I may have seen this one before, but I will go ahead and give an \n    opinion. The manner in which the tsuba is &quot;dished out&quot; with the plate \n    narrower at the center and then gradually thickening towards the rim is \n    the first strong identification feature. Next, the obvious hammer work, \n    giving the tsuba both a wonderful texture and great strength is another \n    strong feature, along with the beaten over rim. The deep purple, black \n    color and the shallow carvings are also very strong features of this \n    artist&#39;s work. The soft rounding of the work in the surface is also \n    classic for this man. The mokko shape is also typical of this worker. \n    The combination of small and large filled hitsu indicate a fairly early \n    guard -- late Muromachi to Momoyama period. The particularly small \n    kogai hitsu would go well with Ko-Mino kogai, some of which are \n    extremely narrow. Given these attributes and the early date, there is \n    only one possible maker and that is Nobuie. I suspect it has a juyo \n    rating as well. A wonderful piece.\n\n    Gordon\n\n    On 2006/03/17, at 13:58, steven wrote:\n\n    &gt; Nobuiye is my vote...\n    &gt;\n    &gt;\n    &gt;\n    &gt; --- In nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Jim Gilbert&quot; &lt;jggilbert@...&gt; \n    &gt; wrote:\n    &gt;&gt;\n    &gt;&gt; The photos for kantei problem number three can be viewed here:\n    &gt;&gt;\n    &gt;&gt; http://ph.groups.yahoo.com/group/nihontostudy/photos/browse/3108\n    &gt;&gt;\n    &gt;&gt; Jim\n    &gt;&gt;\n    &gt;&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n    &gt;&gt;\n    &gt;\n    &gt;\n    &gt;\n    &gt;\n    &gt;\n    &gt;\n    &gt;\n    &gt;\n    &gt; Yahoo!
