There are 239\n&gt; tsuba lots with a mix similar to what is in the\n&gt; other catalogs.  There are 40 lots of kodogu and\n&gt; some books, armor, etc.  There are about 68 lots of\n&gt; swords, including the Kokuho Iesuke, a Juyo Hasebe\n&gt; katana, a blade with Juyo tachi koshirae formerly\n&gt; owned by the Duke of Windsor, a daisho with gold\n&gt; mounted koshirae and another fancy daisho formerly\n&gt; owned by Admiral Nomura.  There&#39;s even a tanto by\n&gt; Francis Boyd.\n&gt; \n&gt; Number 5 has more of Tsuba Geijutsu-ko including\n&gt; Haruta, Suruga, Kamakura bori and the various brass\n&gt; inlay types.  There are 248 lots of tsuba, again the\n&gt; usual mix.  Also 150 or so kodogu lots plus some\n&gt; books, armor and miscellaneous stuff.  There are\n&gt; inro, netsuke, ogime,etc., and 57 lots of prints.  A\n&gt; little bit of everything.  I vaguely recall\n&gt; something about many of the copies of number 5 being\n&gt; damaged in storage, but it may just be that fewer\n&gt; were printed.     \n&gt; \n&gt; Alan Harvie has been selling new copies of the\n&gt; catalogs for years for a very low price, but he has\n&gt; run out of numbers 1, 5 and 10.\n&gt; Jim\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   Can anyone tell me what&#39;s in vols. 1 & 5 of the\n&gt; Haynes catalogues, and why\n&gt;   it is the 5 is the least common?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been\n&gt; removed]\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
