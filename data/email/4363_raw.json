There were some interesting comments in\none of Kapp&#39;s books about how some of these were made with wrought iron \nfrom train rails.\n\nOne other thing to look for is nie - no nie usually means not \ntraditionally made.\n\nrkg\n(Richard George)\n\nbob griffis wrote:\n\n&gt;I&#39;m asking because I have a blade which has all the hallmarks of a \n&gt;traditionally made blade--Masame hada, a well defined and unusual hamon, \n&gt;an 8.5&quot; nakago with taka no ha yasurime and signature.  It is longer \n&gt;than most WWII blades (ha is 26.75&quot;).  It also has a Showa cherry \n&gt;blossom stamp.  The polisher said it was a folded blade (19 folds), \n&gt;confirmed by CAT scan, and was one of the hardest blades to polish he \n&gt;had come across.  Lacking the Showa stamp, they believed its \n&gt;craftsmanship indicated a pre 1860s blade\n&gt;\n&gt;Its matching saya is also unusual--it is covered in a tan-colored same \n&gt;which is 3 skins expertly applied, but the gunto mount looks hacked in \n&gt;as if retrofitted later.\n&gt;\n&gt;So, absent the Showa stamp, both blade and saya suggest an ancestoral \n&gt;blade that was stamped and refitted as gunto for use in WWII.  What else \n&gt;might I look for to authenticate it?\n&gt;\n&gt;nihontochicken wrote:\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Yes, many ancestral blades were remounted in gunto koshirae and\n&gt;&gt;carried off to the Pacific War. But they were not stamped with the\n&gt;&gt;Showa cherry blossom. A Showa stamp, also the nearly as common Seki\n&gt;&gt;stamp, indicates the blade is not completely traditionally made. In\n&gt;&gt;some better examples that look very traditional, displaying both hada\n&gt;&gt;and water tempered hamon, the stamp indicates it was made with western\n&gt;&gt;style steel instead of the traditional tamahagane.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;NC\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;--- In nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n&gt;&gt;&lt;mailto:nihontostudy%40yahoogroups.com&gt;, &quot;mark sala&quot; \n&gt;&gt;&lt;franzkafka19@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Yes this is true. Old mounts removed and new military mounts as\n&gt;&gt;&gt;      \n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;replacements. Reason for this is to make the sword SHOWA. I have\n&gt;&gt;several, well more than several.
