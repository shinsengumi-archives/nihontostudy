Need better closeup images of the tsuba etc etc to study the finer detail.  Also some carefully chosen closeups of the blade.\n\nWhile I&#39;m here, a couple years back I got a call from a man who had found me through the local Japanese Consul General&#39;s office here in Oz.  He was a collector, had 25 swords, and had been collecting for three years!!  Every one of his swords was a Chinese &quot;creation&quot;.  Disappointing for sure.\n\nBarry Thomas.\n\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: molto10 \n  To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Friday, October 13, 2006 4:11 AM\n  Subject: [nihontostudy] any comments about this sword\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
