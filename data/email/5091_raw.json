(It&#39;s just past midnigh=\r\nt on the East coast, \n&gt; but of\n&gt; course it&#39;s already Friday afternoon in Au=\r\nstralia and Japan, Friday \n&gt; morning\n&gt; in Europe, so to keep it fair let&#39;s =\r\nsay the sale ends midnight 7/7/07\n&gt; wherever you are.) Please do feel free =\r\nto pass this message on to \n&gt; interested\n&gt; collectors who may not be on the=\r\n several email lists (and excuse the\n&gt; cross-posting.)\n&gt;\n&gt; No minimum purch=\r\nase - or maximum. This is your chance to get a great \n&gt; deal on\n&gt; Soshu Den=\r\n Meisaku Shu, Tanobe&#39;s Meihin Katanaezu Shusei, the complete 6\n&gt; volume Kan=\r\nzan Token Koza, complete 10 volume Haynes Auction Catalogs,\n&gt; Fukushi&#39;s Got=\r\no and Machibori books, or the Kokuh=F4 T=F4ken Zufu.\n&gt;\n&gt; All shipping will =\r\nbe done at cost as I always have. Postage rates,\n&gt; especially for overseas =\r\nshipments have changed drastically since May 14th,\n&gt; but I will work with y=\r\nou to get your order to you safely and quickly with\n&gt; the least expense pos=\r\nsible.\n&gt;\n&gt; Regrettably, if you live in Illinois, I have to charge 8.75% sal=\r\nes tax.\n&gt;\n&gt; As always, what is listed on my website is not all of what I ha=\r\nve on hand,\n&gt; though I will make every effort to keep updating. If there&#39;s =\r\nsomething\n&gt; you&#39;ve been looking for, please do ask as I very likely may hav=\r\ne it.\n&gt;\n&gt; Payment by PayPal, or direct credit card charge to your Visa, Mas=\r\nterCard,\n&gt; American Express, or Discover Card, and I will accept wire trans=\r\nfers to\n&gt; accommodate overseas customers.\n&gt;\n&gt; Finally, I am aware that the =\r\nhosting service I use has an expired security\n&gt; certificate, so if you want=\r\n to use a credit card you can call me, fax \n&gt; me, or\n&gt; split the informatio=\r\nn into two or more email messages. Also, there&#39;s a bug\n&gt; in the PayPal orde=\r\nring button - yes, I&#39;m moving to a new hosting \n&gt; service and\n&gt; working wit=\r\nh a new web person to fix these things. It&#39;s probably best to\n&gt; email me di=\r\nrectly in any case as the shipping for each order will be\n&gt; different.\n&gt;\n&gt; =\r\nThanks in advance for your continued support!\n&gt;\n&gt; Craig\n&gt;\n&gt; Craig L.
