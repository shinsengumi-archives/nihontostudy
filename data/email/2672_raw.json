These were then corrected in the later editions.\n \nI&#39;ve searched what archives I have to verify this bit of information kicking\naround my aging and untrustworthy brain without success. Can anyone\ncorroborate or refute this or shed any light on the subject?\n \nAnd before anyone asks, I&#39;m out of stock on the first edition, but you can\nadd your name to the want list. Second edition orders will be filled right\naway!\n \n \nCraig L.
