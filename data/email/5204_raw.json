Is this the avarage value?\n&gt;\n\nIt certainly means someone thought it was,=\r\n but that doesn&#39;t mean much.\n I have seen known repos go for alot.  Most of=\r\n us have (most of us\nhave also been the one to bid high as well at one poin=\r\nt or another) I\ndon&#39;t follow that particular style so pricing isn&#39;t somethi=\r\nng I will\ncomment on.  The one thing I am learning is that there were a lot=\r\n of\n&quot;copies&quot; made in the early 1800&#39;s, so they are old in one respect, but\n=\r\nthey aren&#39;t the real deal.  Then there all the copies made in the late\n1800=\r\n&#39;s that were more for the international/tourist markets. I don&#39;t\nhave a tea=\r\ncher and have been blowing my opportunities to be with other\ncollectors.  I=\r\n was so excited joining the NY token kai with access to\nmany knowledgeable =\r\npeople.  But between my health issues and my kids\nusually visiting me the w=\r\neekend the club meets has put a huge damper\non me being able to go.  I was =\r\npicking up things here and there though\nand it all goes back to the iron or=\r\n base metals used.  You start to\nrecognize the metal from the 1800&#39;s which =\r\nis trying to imitate but\nusually it is a bit overdone.  I wish I could spen=\r\nd more time with\nknowledgeable folks.  I have to make my way back to the to=\r\nken kai. \nPricing by the way is something that I have struggled with since =\r\nthe\nbeginning.  I think it just takes time to get an idea of where a piece\n=\r\nprice range falls into.  This is not an exact science by any means. \nAnd un=\r\nfortunately, the advice I was given on what it&#39;s worth hold\ntrue, &quot; it is w=\r\north whatever someone else is willing to pay for it&quot;. \nNot a lot of practic=\r\nal help.  So much too learn.  Good luck and just\nkeep plugging at it.  As J=\r\nim Gilbert says just keep on looking at\nthem, after feeling and studying ov=\r\ner 10,000 you will start to get an\nidea.  Don&#39;t let that number discourage =\r\nyou, just keep at it.  Best of\n luck and remember the most important thing =\r\nabout collecting sword\nfittings, Send all Praying Mantis themed fittings to=\r\n me. LOL.\nThanks,\nKen aka &quot;the mantis dude&quot;\nhttp://www.freewebs.com/kamakir=\r\niken/index.htm\n\n\n"
