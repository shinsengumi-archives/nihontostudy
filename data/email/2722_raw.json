It is useful to remember that\nwhile sword knowledge and what should be designated as what goes back at\nleast to the time of the first Ashikaga Shogun, knowledge of tosogu,\nparticularly iron tsuba, goes back no early than the late Bakumatsu era,\nparticularly with the writings of Akiyama and \nKawaguchi. The knowledge paradigm is a still expanding one and the\nboundaries are somewhat indistinct and evolving. There can be a great\ndeal of controversy as to what group something falls into and wildly\ndifferent opinions as to age of manufacture, that of course hinging on\nthe date of the adoption and substantial spread of the use of\nuchi-gatana. All one needs to do is to watch the moving time line in the\nwritings of the late Sasano Masayuki.\n My advice would be to be conservative in what you submit unless it is a\npiece about which you have a great deal of curiosity and it being of\ngood workmanship, preservation and aesthetic content. On the other hand\none can not sell short the impact that papers have on the value of\nfittings and the certainty with which they can be sold at a predictable\nprice, if that is of relevance to you.\n Arnold\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; jdz@... 03/20/05 3:17 PM &gt;&gt;&gt;\n\nI&#39;ve never submitted anything for papers, and just to experience the\nprocess I was thinking of submitting one or two tsuba to shinsa.  \n\nBut looking at the costs, and not believing I own any more than\nHozon-level sorts of tsuba, I began to wonder if it made sense to spend\nseveral hundred dollars just to add minimum Hozon papers, or perhaps to\nfail.  \n\nAny wisdom out there on how good a tsuba needs to be to be Hozon or\nTokubetsu Hozon?  Why paper a tsuba at all?  What makes you decide to\nsubmit a particular one?\n\nDZ\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n\n \nYahoo! Groups Links\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n"
