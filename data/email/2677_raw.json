I&#39;ve never seen one like it\n&gt; &gt; before. It&#39;s saya is made of bamboo.  The tsuba is gold or brass \nwith\n&gt; &gt; what look like narcissus flowers and pods.  The blade is forged \nbut\n&gt; &gt; doesn&#39;t appear to be high-quality steel (hamon is midare).  The\n&gt; &gt; kojiri of the saya is flared.  The kissaki is O and the mune is\n&gt; &gt; ihori. The boshi is midare-komi on one side and almost Jizo on the\n&gt; &gt; other.  Nakago appears to be tanago. The ji has what looks like \nlong\n&gt; &gt; faint lotus flowers decorating it.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; More strangely, there is no kashira, same, ito, menuki, on the \ntsuka,\n&gt; &gt; which I believe is made of wood, rather than bamboo.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I ran the characters past a Korean and a Chinese woman and neither\n&gt; &gt; could tell me anything. No surprise there, however I couldn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; identify the characters in either the Japanese or Chinese \ncharacter\n&gt; &gt; references on the Web.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; If any of you fine scholars can tell me what Ive gotten myself \ninto,\n&gt; &gt; or where it might actually be from and when, I would appreciate \nit.\n&gt; &gt; Please respond to the group and to my email address:\n&gt; &gt; grandone@c... I&#39;m located in the USA.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Thanks so much for reading all this.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Regards,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Jim\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n\n"
