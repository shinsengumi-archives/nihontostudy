I can tell you it&#39;s \ncured me of showing a Japanese blade (albeit a small one) to people whom \ndon&#39;t understand what there is to appreciate.\n\nMy question relates to protective oil. Obviously I felt a little urgency \nto clean & protect! In NZ we don&#39;t have ready access to choji oil. \nLooking on the web I found several references to using mineral oil (not \nstocked in NZ pharmacies) or gun oil.\n\nAfter a visit to the local gun ship, I walked out with Remington &quot;Rem \nOil Wipes&quot;. But I&#39;m not happy with the results, possibly caused by the \nadditives in the wipes like teflon & who knows what else.\n\nThe polished surface of blade, whilst not exactly dulled, no longer \nshows Takano san&#39;s hada as well as it did. Additionally I now have that \nmulticoloured oily sheen over the surface, but that may be normal?\n\nMineral Oil. References I&#39;ve read refer to it as a laxative and finding \nit in your local pharmacy. Obviously we do things different here in \nlittle ol&#39; New Zealand! But I&#39;m reluctant to purchase anything from the \nhardware store until I know better what it is I&#39;m getting.\n\nCan someone suggest product names or precise details on what mineral oil \nis in the US, so I can find a NZ match.\n\nThanks for the help.\nMatt\n\n"
