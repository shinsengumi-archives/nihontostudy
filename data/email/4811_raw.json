The Higo school is a nice school,\nand did good work. Their style spread and was often\ncopied. I too think the design is of a very stylized\ndragon. It might be what is known as Edo Higo (Higo\nstyle manufactured in Edo). The sharp shape of the\nkashira is uncommon.\n\nOn the sword, I cannot say much. It is unsigned. It\ndoesn&#39;t seem any of us recognize that mark. I was\nhoping someone would.\n   Without a signature and with the sword  blade &quot;out\nof polish&quot; it will be hard for us to say what school\nor person made the blade. Many very old blades (of\nhigh art value) are not signed, but also many 1920s to\n1945 blades (of low art value) were unsigned. Someone\nwith experience in assessing out of polish\n&quot;closet-finds&quot; like yours should take a serious look\nat it. You sword may be a diamond,- or it may be a\ndud. Given that it has some fair fittings of older\norigin (not the military issue of WW2), I would say it\nhas a fair chance at being a decent blade. That is no\nguarantee, -just my gut feeling.\n\nCurran\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--- BECKY WALLACE &lt;SNDE92BW@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; I have posted the requested pictures.  Hope they\n&gt; help.  I also did as a friend of mine at work\n&gt; suggested and performed a rubbing on the tang.  The\n&gt; character that looked like a Y now looks like a Y\n&gt; with a &quot;n&quot; attached to the bottom right side.  I\n&gt; tried to draw it in Power Point - I think I captured\n&gt; the gist of it, but the arms of the Y aren&#39;t crooked\n&gt; like my left side is.  I think I&#39;ve seen this\n&gt; character before.  Later if I have time, I&#39;ll try\n&gt; and scan the rubbing so you can see what I actually\n&gt; see, but for now I have to run.\n&gt;    \n&gt;   Becky\n&gt; \n&gt; Curran Campbell &lt;neobliviscar@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;           Becky,\n&gt; \n&gt; Happy New Year!\n&gt; I&#39;d agree with John, Barry, and Rich. My interest is\n&gt; in fittings, so I agree with Barry in that the fuchi\n&gt; (and probably the kashira too) looks interesting.\n&gt; We&#39;d\n&gt; love to see more photographs, if possible. Just be\n&gt; gentle with the tsuka (handle), but don&#39;t be afraid\n&gt; of\n&gt; it.\n&gt; \n&gt; The nakago (tang) of the sword isn&#39;t signed, but\n&gt; does\n&gt; hold some promise at first glance. If you can take a\n&gt; whole shot of the nakago, it would be most\n&gt; beneficial\n&gt; to the sword guys on the list.\n&gt; Is Harry Watson on this list? Any chance you will\n&gt; be in Dallas this year at the gunshow she mentioned?\n&gt; \n&gt; Curran\n&gt; \n&gt; --- Richard Turner &lt;ikkanshi@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Hi Becky, it would be great to see the whole\n&gt; Nakago\n&gt; &gt; ( tang ) as the \n&gt; &gt; sword looks Suriage, and maybe O Suriage ( greatly\n&gt; &gt; shortened )\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Sorry to ask, but you love hard work :-) can you\n&gt; &gt; supply an image of the \n&gt; &gt; whole tang ?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Cheers\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Rich\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; BECKY WALLACE wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; OK, with your encouragement, I have disassembled\n&gt; &gt; my sword, taken \n&gt; &gt; &gt; pictures and posted them in my folder &quot;Becky&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; Sword&quot;. They are the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; last 5 pictures in the folder. If the sword\n&gt; blade\n&gt; &gt; is signed it appears \n&gt; &gt; &gt; to be with a single character that looks\n&gt; something\n&gt; &gt; like a Y. It isn&#39;t \n&gt; &gt; &gt; very clear and the pictures aren&#39;t very good,\n&gt; but\n&gt; &gt; if anyone can tell \n&gt; &gt; &gt; anything, I&#39;d sure like to know it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Becky\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; bungotakadasword &lt;MuramasaIII@...\n&gt; &gt; &lt;mailto:MuramasaIII%40aol.com&gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;mailto:nihontostudy%40yahoogroups.com&gt;, BECKY\n&gt; &gt; WALLACE &lt;SNDE92BW@...&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Wow, I can&#39;t believe it. The scan you put in\n&gt; my\n&gt; &gt; folder. The one\n&gt; &gt; &gt; top left is identical to mine. Same crickets.\n&gt; And\n&gt; &gt; the signature is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; identical to the one someone posted as a mino.\n&gt; So\n&gt; &gt; now I know about the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; tsuba. So what about the sword? Is the maker of\n&gt; &gt; the sword and the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; tsuba generally completely different people?\n&gt; &gt; schools? are they\n&gt; &gt; &gt; totally disassociated or might there be some\n&gt; &gt; swordsmiths that tended to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; use tsubas from this particular school?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Becky\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; based on your pic # 4........... all you have to\n&gt; &gt; do is remove that wood\n&gt; &gt; &gt; peg ( behind the fuchi ) and the whole &quot; handle\n&gt; &quot;\n&gt; &gt; will come off and you\n&gt; &gt; &gt; can take pics.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I labelled it &quot; mino &quot; because I put it with a\n&gt; &gt; Mino sword.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; milt\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been\n&gt; &gt; removed]\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been\n&gt; &gt; removed]\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; __________________________________________________\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?\n&gt; Tired of spam?
