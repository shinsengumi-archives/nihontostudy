I work as a conservator\n(artwork on paper) by day, so safe storage is one thing we&#39;re concerned about.  I&#39;d avoid using\nany sort of curing latex or Styrofoam product.  Prolonged off-gassing can be a problem.  I&#39;m not\nsure that the vapors will affect metal, but they will definitely affect silk. I&#39;d urge you to\nconsider getting in touch with an objects conservator at a major museum with tsuba in their\ncollection.  Perhaps the Museum of Fine Arts Boston, with which I am familiar.\n\nAs for foam, there is a safe foam on the market called &#39;Ethafoam&#39; made by Dow chemical.  There is\na company called Gaylord  (www.gaylord.com) which sells it but I am sure there are others.  It is\narchivally sound and can be cut with scissors/knife to any shape.\n\n-Doug Sanders\n--- Ron Hartmann &lt;swords@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; Wondered about using thin Styrofoam for this. Guess there would be no chemical reaction problem\n&gt; with Styrofoam? Balsa wood might be as easy to work with and more durable. Guess I&#39;ll have to\n&gt; sit down and experiment with these ideas. \n&gt; \n&gt; Ron\n&gt; STL\n&gt;   ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt;   From: alchemyst \n&gt;   To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n&gt;   Sent: Tuesday, October 19, 2004 3:24 PM\n&gt;   Subject: [nihontostudy] Re: tsuba boxes\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   Ron -\n&gt; \n&gt;   Styrofoam can be simply cut or scooped out to most\n&gt;   any shape. Then covered with silk should do the\n&gt;   job and look good.
