The sayagaki by Homma sensei stated\nexplicitly that the sword was saiba but because of it&#39;s\nextreme importance as reference material was granted Juyo status.\nThe only other extant example being in the\nImperial Household Collection (Gyobutsu).\nIt was sold to a Japanese dealer who understood its importance.\nP.S. It was signed Chikamura Murakami.\nThe Murakami was not added later, but is read as tatematsuru.\n\nRegards,\nCary Condell\n\nCondell & Co., Ltd.\nP.O.

I wanted to inquire, but\n&gt; the discussion moved on, and I didn&#39;t get a chance.  I made a note of the\n&gt; term to look it up, and found Hawley&#39;s definition, which applied to a sword\n&gt; I have at home.\n&gt; :\n&gt; : I think the definition you have provided is more likely what Cary and the\n&gt; gang were talking about, though obviously odd in the case of such an old\n&gt; sword.  Thanks for the information.\n&gt; :\n&gt; :\n&gt; :   ----- Original Message -----\n&gt; :   From: Jim Gilbert\n&gt; :   To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; :   Sent: Monday, June 23, 2003 8:23 PM\n&gt; :   Subject: Re: [nihontostudy] Ubuha\n&gt; :\n&gt; :\n&gt; :   David,\n&gt; :   I don&#39;t think there are different forms... it&#39;s a short section of\n&gt; &quot;unsharpened&quot; edge just above the hamachi.  It&#39;s not unusual with gendaito,\n&gt; but is rather rare in older blades.  It is ground away as the blade is\n&gt; polished over time.\n&gt; :\n&gt; :   Very old and very good saiha swords that are otherwise intact can\n&gt; sometimes get kanteisho.\n&gt; :\n&gt; :   Hopefully someone more knowledgeable about swords can comment.\n&gt; :\n&gt; :   Jim\n&gt; :\n&gt; :\n&gt; :     Can anyone think of any publications featuring illustrations of\n&gt; different\n&gt; :     forms of ubuha?\n&gt; :\n&gt; :     Do retempered swords ever receive papers?\n&gt; :\n&gt; :\n&gt; :\n&gt; :   [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt; :\n&gt; :\n&gt; :         Yahoo!
