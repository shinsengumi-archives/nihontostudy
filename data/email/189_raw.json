I would expect they were altered long before that. You would have to\nlook at the condition of the rust. If the rust is of the type found on\nblades that were made during the same period, then they were altered then.\nOf course, some could have been chemically rusted, but I think that would\nstill be noticable. On the other hand, we are presuming that all Japanese\nsoliders of WWII were sufficiently sensitive to sword culture to not make\nsuch alterations. I am not very convinced that they were then or that the\naverage Japanese is now.\n\nGordon\n  -----Original Message-----\n  From: Richard Turner [mailto:ikkanshi@...]\n  Sent: Tuesday, May 06, 2003 1:08 PM\n  To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com\n  Subject: [nihontostudy] A thought\n\n\n  Hi all, I was thinking about this on the weekend. We see a lot of Swords\nthat have been shortend during the second world war to fit Gunto koshirae\nand many of these swords turn out to be high quality items. It is of course\ndependant on the original swords size as to whether it became Suriage or\nO&#39;suriage but my question is this.\n  What is the opinion of Suriage/O&#39;suriage in Japan.\n\n  I would assume it is the same as ours and maybe things have changed a bit\nin the time since WW2 but If I had a family sword that was know to be of\nquality and by a well known smith, be him Koto or Shinto, I am unsure if I\nwould want to cut the mei off or shorten the nakago by any length to fit\ninto fitting&#39;s to take on the battle field.\n\n  Was it not possible to have a tsuka made to fit the sword ? I know there\nare many Juyo Suriage blade in museums in Japan but they are of course very\nspecial and for the most part, very old. Was it more important to the\nofficer that he carried his family sword into battle, regarless of what that\nrequired, be it shortening or whatever.\n\n  cheers\n\n  Rich T\n\n\n  ---\n  Outgoing mail is certified Virus Free.\n  Checked by AVG anti-virus system (http://www.grisoft.com).\n  Version: 6.0.471 / Virus Database: 269 - Release Date: 10/04/2003\n\n\n\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n        Yahoo!
