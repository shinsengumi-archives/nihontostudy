There was a lot of testing done at the \nexecution g=\r\nrounds and it seems probable that a sword of particularly \nheavy weight and=\r\n special construction would be used to test ones \nabilities in a one handed=\r\n stroke. I would hate to be the prisoner, \nas, the one handed grip has a te=\r\nndency to turn in the cut. Most \nexecutions being done by low ranking bushi=\r\n. I do not think that it \nwould be used because of the rain though. There w=\r\nould be plenty of \nattendants to assist with the restraints, guarding, offi=\r\ncial \nrecorders and their attendants that someone could hold an umbrella or=\r\n \nconstruct cover. The thought of the executioner calling &quot;Bring the \nspeci=\r\nal umbrella holding one handed in the rain sword&quot; is what \nbrought a smile =\r\nto my face.
