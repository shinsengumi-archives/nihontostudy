I&#39;ll look\n  into it. I am a &quot;practitioner&quot;-, although the we=\r\napon I mostly train\n  with is the katana. Nonetheless, I started training w=\r\nith naginata,\n  too, about, oh, 3 years ago. I&#39;m still a rank beginner, but=\r\n I&#39;m very\n  much interested in it as a weapon. I also started training in Y=\r\nari\n  around the same time. But while I practice and learn katana waza\n  we=\r\nekly, or sometimes more often, I do naginata and yari maybe once a month.\n\n=\r\n  Best Regards,\n\n  Andres\n\n  At 07:54 AM 12/8/2006, you wrote:\n  &gt;Hi Andres=\r\n,\n  &gt; Nice to see someone else out there interested in these\n  &gt;wonderful p=\r\nolearms. Knutsen&#39;s book is one of the only ones in english that\n  I\n  &gt;am a=\r\nware of. Are you a &quot;practitioner&quot; of Naginata or simply looking to\n  study\n=\r\n  &gt;them?\n  &gt;Another book you may want to look at is; Naginata - The Definit=\r\nive Guide by\n  &gt;Dr. Alexander Bennett.

Expect a wait of\n  &gt;3-4 months! With that said, the=\r\n book comes with some glowing reviews since\n  &gt;anything on the subject in e=\r\nnglish is so rare. During the historical\n  &gt;developement of Japan, it&#39;s ama=\r\nzing to see that the Katana took a backseat\n  &gt;to the Bow and Naginata.\n  &gt;=\r\n\n  &gt;Mark\n  &gt;\n  &gt;\n  &gt;\n  &gt;-----Original Message-----\n  &gt;From: HYPERLINK\n  &quot;ma=\r\nilto:nihontostudy%40yahoogroups.com&quot;nihontostudy@-yahoogroups.-com\n  [mailt=\r\no: HYPERLINK\n  &quot;mailto:nihontostudy%40yahoogroups.com&quot;nihontostudy@-yahoogr=\r\noups.-com]On\n  &gt;Behalf Of Andres Pedraza\n  &gt;Sent: Thursday, December 07, 20=\r\n06 8:43 PM\n  &gt;To: HYPERLINK &quot;mailto:nihonto%40yahoogroups.com&quot;nihonto@yahoo=\r\ngroups-.com;\n  HYPERLINK\n  &quot;mailto:nihontostudy%40yahoogroups.com&quot;nihontost=\r\nudy@-yahoogroups.-com\n  &gt;Subject: [nihontostudy] Yari and Naginata\n  &gt;\n  &gt;\n=\r\n  &gt;\n  &gt;Nihonto People,\n  &gt;\n  &gt;I haven&#39;t seen a whole lot of books on Yari a=\r\nnd/or Naginata in\n  &gt;English, so even though it was a bit pricy, I purchase=\r\nd Roald and\n  &gt;Susan Knutsen&#39;s book ( HYPERLINK\n  &gt;&quot; HYPERLINK &quot;http://tiny=\r\nurl.com/yxlhuj&quot;http://tinyurl.-com/yxlhuj&quot;\n  HYPERLINK &quot;http://tinyurl.-com=\r\n/yxlhuj&quot;http://tinyurl.--com/yxlhuj).
