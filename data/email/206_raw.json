Bill and one of his\n&gt; students (and I)  published a small paper calling attention to the residual\n&gt; stresses within Japanese swords. Bill&#39;s insights was that strong\n&gt; compressive pressure on the hamon contributed to - indeed, allowed - the\n&gt; martensite of the edge to withstand the abuse of a swung sword. I think\n&gt; this is NOT entirely germane to the point the NC is making, but Bill argued\n&gt; that a factor that contributed to the ability to set up the compressive\n&gt; tension was the fact that nippon-to are in essence composite structures.\n&gt; That is, they are combination of different orders of steel heightens a\n&gt; blade&#39;s ability to hold the cutting edge in compression. That may explain\n&gt; the development of the multi-part cross sections.\n&gt; Peter Bleed\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; nihontostudy-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
