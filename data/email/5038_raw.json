Last year I purchased three swords to get the one, an O-suriage daito in beat-up shirasaya. My &quot;gut&quot; told me it was quite old -- both sides had been &quot;lightly&quot; buffed but the hamon and jigane could still be seen, sort of. I liked the blade but it puzzled me. I saw Yamashiro things going on but also Yamato indicators. It was basically suguha with slight undulations. Jigane was impressively worked itame but with fine masame running along the ha within the hamon. Nie activity was more ko-nie and showing quality. I was puzzled but hopeful that &quot;whatever&quot; it was, it was quite early work. \n\nOnce in Mr. Tanobe&#39;s hands he felt it was &quot;at least&quot; Nambokucho and probably Nio den. It is now polished (but still in Japan awaiting Juyo shinsa) and was papered and attributed to Nio Kiyotsuna which would place it late Kamakura work ca. 1320. \n\nI&#39;ll send you a copy of my record sheet for this sword although some details might change since I based my information on what I could see before polish. There are other indicators that puzzled me which I noted on my record sheet. Mr. Tanobe reassured me that it is a very fine sword and worth &quot;trying&quot; submitting for Juyo. (But I won&#39;t count my chickens...) \n\nInteresting, once I learned it was Nio -- actually, this would place it as &quot;ko-Nio&quot; from what I read -- I discovered in English edition Token Bijutsu,  issue 42, a ko-Nio sword featured in the fold-out section. The description read as if it was describing my sword!!! I was amazed. I&#39;d heard of Nio swords before but only those from much later times (which are not always that good, so I&#39;m told). \n\nCheck out the sugata of your sword and study the jigane. If sugata looks &quot;tachi&quot; with small kissaki and you see the mixed jigane, I&#39;d say you might have something there, Professor. \n\nRon\nSTL\n\n\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: Peter A Bleed \n  To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Sunday, May 27, 2007 8:04 PM\n  Subject: [nihontostudy] Nio School\n\n\n\n  Dear List,\n  For the obvious reasons, . . . I am suddenly curious about blades of the\n  Nio School. It is listed as an example of the Yamato-den, but it seems like\n  an isolated group. Can any one give any guidance on its relative\n  importance. Likewise, it seems to have had a long history. Are there rules\n  of thumb for telling the difference between very old (Kamakura) blade from\n  those of - say - Nambokucho ago, or even newer.\n  Thanking you in advance,\n  Peter\n\n  Peter Bleed\n\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n   \n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
