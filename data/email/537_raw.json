Today, I would only submit a tsuba to shinsa if the signature was important enough to make the tsuba &quot;valuable&quot; enough to justify the costs. One tsuba here that I&#39;m considering sending to shinsa is mumei but if judged &quot;Akasaka&quot; and perhaps designated to a particular generation, in my eyes, it would justify the cost of shinsa. Bob Benson mentioned awhile back that a lot of people are acquiring only Hozon papers and not bothering with paying for Tokubetsu shinsa, simply to &quot;confirm&quot; the mei. \n\nPersonally, I am an advocate of papers being gotten on &quot;priority&quot; items in my collection. \n\nRon\nSTL\n\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: alchemyst \n  To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Thursday, July 10, 2003 12:24 PM\n  Subject: [nihontostudy] Re: papering tsuba\n\n\n  Ken -\n\n  My feeble thoughts on the topic. I have several papered\n  tsuba; all purchased with papers. Papers aren&#39;t my thing.\n  But I do plan on submitting two or three at the next US\n  shinsa just to get opinions on school and age. IMHO\n  unless it is a matter of verifying a mei of a famous\n  maker; getting info is the main reason for submitting for\n  papers. I agree that at the current rates, especially for\n  the NBTHK, it is not feasible to submit anything but very\n  high grade fittings. The cost of the shinsa is more than\n  the fittings (even with papers) would be worth in most cases.\n  Just my humble $0.03 worth (to allow for inflation)\n\n  Rich\n\n\n\n        Yahoo!
