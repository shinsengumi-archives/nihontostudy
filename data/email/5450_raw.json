Yes I think this is =\r\na Repo also, but maybe late 20th \n  century as a guess. It&#39;s a copy, I beli=\r\neve of a K=F4 Sh=F4ami tsuba that was \n  originally done in a soft metal (Y=\r\namagane from memory) in the Momoyama \n  period, or perhaps a bit earlier.\n\n=\r\n  Anyway. as I said, I think this is a very modern repo, just my opinioon \n=\r\n  nayway.\n\n  Cheers\n\n  Richard\n\n  darpa_ems wrote:\n  &gt;\n  &gt; I&#39;ve had this ts=\r\nuba for well over 20 years, & have wondered what info\n  &gt; there might be on=\r\n it... It&#39;s a rabbit & waves design, with no ID marks.\n  &gt; It&#39;s iron, about=\r\n 8cm x 8.5cm x 4mm. I believe it&#39;s a early 20th\n  &gt; cent. repro, at least I=\r\n kind of hope it is, as it&#39;s been on several of\n  &gt; my practice swords over=\r\n the years... When I got it it had a nice solid\n  &gt; brown patina, but enoug=\r\nh rust scaling to need cleaning with a wirewheel.\n  &gt;\n  &gt; Pics are here-\n  =\r\n&gt; http://ph.groups.yahoo.com/group/nihontostudy/photos/browse/e85a \n  &gt; &lt;ht=\r\ntp://ph.groups.yahoo.com/group/nihontostudy/photos/browse/e85a&gt;\n  &gt;\n  &gt; Any=\r\n thoughts would be greatly appreciated. Not looking to sell it,\n  &gt; just in=\r\nfo on period, school, maker, etc... :)\n  &gt;\n  &gt; Thanks!\n  &gt;\n  &gt; A.W.\n  &gt;\n  &gt;=\r\n \n\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n   \n\n[Non-tex=\r\nt portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
