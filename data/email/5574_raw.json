I&#39;ve not clue as to the actual quality of these tsuba but I believe the original collector was into &quot;identifying&quot; everything and also, I seem to recall that one of the main auction houses -- Sotheby or Christies? -- may have go over the collection to I.D. things for the museum. I should look at my earlier correspondence, but I am pretty sure most of these are soft metal tsuba and not so much into good iron. I&#39;d love to drive to Topika myself but would have to find something else to also visit while in the area. I always like to mention...if you find yourself heading east to St. Louis, hollar. Always nice to have a visitor. \n\nRon\nSTL\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: jason kretik \n  To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Friday, June 05, 2009 5:36 AM\n  Subject: Re: [nihontostudy] Tsuba exhibit coming in July...\n\n\n\n\n\n  I want to express my thanks for posting this!

I&#39;ve been in contact with these people regarding the group of tsuba in their collection but I&#39;ve no idea as to their quality or reliable documentation, but it might be worth checking out next month. The display will be at the \n  Mulvane Art Museum, Topeka, Kansas\n  They advised...\n  ------------ ---\n  Opening this Summer at our museum will be a large collection of Tsubas (54), Yatate (39), and over 50 Japanese color woodcut prints in one exhibit. The exhibit will open July 5, 2009 and will be on display through January 17, 2010. \n\n  Mulvane Art Museum\n  17th & Jewell, Topeka, KS\n  785.670.1124\n  mulvane.info@ washburn. ed\n  ------------ ---------\n  Ron\n  STL\n\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n  \n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
