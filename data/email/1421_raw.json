One photo shows the face of the kozuka, the other its profile showing the greatly raised design. Maybe this will explain what you&#39;ve been saying, maybe not. Please, comments welcomed! \n\n  http://tinyurl.com/27m5c\n\n  Ron\n  STL\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: Jim Gilbert \n  To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Thursday, January 08, 2004 5:49 PM\n  Subject: Re: [nihontostudy] Re: (unknown) mino-style tsuba\n\n\n  Matt,\n  The photo still doesn&#39;t do the subject justice, but the most detailed, well exposed image I could find is from the frontispiece of the Gifu City Museum Kinko Mino-bori catalog.  Excuse the &quot;jumble-style&quot; presentation of the photo.  Hopefully the details will help.  The link is to the medium sized file.  A click on that image will take you to a 720k version, which is reccomended if you have the interest and the bandwidth.\n\n  http://tinyurl.com/22kox\n\n  Jim\n  --------------------------------------\n  3. Could someone perhaps do a photo comparison for the list between\n  genuine (16th century?) Mino goto stuff and later rubbish copies? I\n  think that would be extremely educational. Just like what you did at the\n  SF show Jim? \n\n  thanks, Matt \n\n\n\n\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  Yahoo!
