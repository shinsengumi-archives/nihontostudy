I am glad to hear that=\r\n you have bought some fine swords from him. I am about to buy swords from h=\r\nim and did not at all feel anything wrong in our correspondance, only that =\r\nhe seems good and straight as you describe him. But I have been cheeted awf=\r\nul before using the net, even though I had copy of passport and drivers lic=\r\nense. I am also new in collecting and buying on the net. Therefore I am ver=\r\ny carefully to ask peoble with the same interest whether a seller is trustf=\r\nully or not. I am very anxious to learn what I can from others but do not l=\r\nike to spend money for a sword and then don=B4t get it. I wish to be aware =\r\nabout who are the bad guys and who are the good ones. .\n\nHi Steve\nThankyou =\r\nso much for the link. Will love to investigate all the beautyful photos fur=\r\nther.\n\nAppreciate your help\nAll the best\nAllan\n  ----- Original Message ---=\r\n-- \n  From: Michael Vinehout \n  To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: W=\r\nednesday, October 27, 2004 4:42 PM\n  Subject: RE: [nihontostudy] Tokugawa D=\r\naisho\n\n\n  Hi Allan, I know Bill Rannow and have bought several swords from =\r\nhim.  He \n  mainly sells polished and papered swords.  He is a good guy and=\r\n a straight \n  shooter.  I recommend him.  I have not been disappointed in =\r\nthe swords I \n  have bought from him.

I bought the Daisho set first and then the\n  &gt;owner =\r\nhad seen it on the net and then provided the tanto for sale. I\n  &gt;believe t=\r\nhat it is great that all 3 pieces are together now. Maybe\n  &gt;that they some=\r\n day may come back to The Tokugawa Museum ? Have been\n  &gt;looking at many we=\r\nbsites and hae besides NihontoAntiques, as I\n  &gt;received very good recommen=\r\ndation about, - thankyou, also seen www.\n  &gt;artswords.com owned by Bill Ran=\r\nnow who have many fine things on his\n  &gt;site, swords as well as fittings. D=\r\noes anybody know him or have\n  &gt;bought something from him. It looks very go=\r\nod to me?.\n  &gt;Regarding the Tokugawa, I need a little help to translate the=\r\n\n  &gt;correct mei on the shoto which I translate as Kunifusa.\n  &gt;Unfortunatel=\r\ny I can not differ from Hawleys Kun 34 - 39. I have\n  &gt;tried to take some g=\r\nood photos of the mei but have not succeeded yet\n  &gt;and will return for hel=\r\np when I have some good photos.\n  &gt;I learn a lot from all off you so please=\r\n continue the lessons,\n  &gt;thankyou.\n  &gt;All the best\n  &gt;Allan\n  &gt;\n  &gt;\n  &gt;\n\n =\r\n _________________________________________________________________\n  Expres=\r\ns yourself instantly with MSN Messenger!
