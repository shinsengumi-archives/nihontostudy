Groups could and did work in popular styles that were not traditionally their own.  (Although Kinai people did of course do nunome on iron sukashi, I agree that the design and execution are typical Shoami.)  It can be easy to assign a piece to a &quot;type&quot; but knowing who really made it without a signature can be difficult to impossible.  The examples can be more confounding than this one.\n\nObviously lesser makers frequently copied more famous types, but sometimes there are guards signed by skilled makers working in a different style that would never be attributed to that maker if left unsigned.  Occasionally there will be several examples of an uncommon style of guard looking very much alike but signed by makers from groups with no known connection.  \n\nA lot of it was probably purely market driven, doing whatever is in fashion and selling well, or what a customer specifically commissioned.  In some cases it may have been technical/artistic curiosity to try working in another style for those who had the freedom and income to experiment.  Who knows?\n\nJim\n\nanyway, without looking at the mei und assuming it&#39;s mumei, I would \nswear this is a typical Shoami work.\n\nmilt\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
