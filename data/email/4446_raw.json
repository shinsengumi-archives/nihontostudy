This blade is suriage and the Mei that is present \nis &#39;Bizen (no) Kuni =\r\nJu Osafune&#39;(cut). This blade has paper from \nInami Hakusui. He papered it t=\r\no a Shinto Sukesada. From my studies \nand the opinion of others, only Koto =\r\nblades were signed as above \n(Bizen Kuni Ju Osafune (name)). \n\nMoses and I =\r\ndecided to submit it to the NY NTHK Shinsa to learn \ntheir opinion. I haven=\r\n&#39;t heard from Moses yet but am very curious. \nDid they even give it paper? =\r\nAs soon as I hear, I will let you know \nthe out come.\n\n\n\n\n--- In nihontostu=\r\ndy@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Mark Conneran&quot; &lt;conneranm@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; For what it=\r\n&#39;s worth, as a potential &quot;new-bee&quot;, I thought I&#39;d be \npresumptuous \n&gt; enoug=\r\nh to make a few observations regarding the Jersey City show. \nI came up \n&gt; =\r\nto the show with a friend, hoping to take in a lecture or two. \nObviously a=\r\n \n&gt; lot of work went into it. A few thoughts, for what it&#39;s worth, as \n&gt; co=\r\nnstructive criticism. We went to the taikai and skipped the \nshinsa \n&gt; thin=\r\nking that the latter would only be for those submitting swords \nto be \n&gt; ev=\r\naluated. The taikai was worthwhile for the budo demonstrations \nalone. The =\r\n\n&gt; swords in the sword display, however, were not labeled and we \nwere, of =\r\n\n&gt; course, curious to know what it was we were viewing. \n&gt;  \n&gt; We are both =\r\nmembers of JSS/US but haven&#39;t attended any of the NY \nclub \n&gt; meetings and =\r\nreally have little sword knowledge. As such I&#39;m \nenormously \n&gt; impressed by=\r\n the knowledge of the members of this list. But from \nthe \n&gt; comments I&#39;ve =\r\nseen here earlier discussing the need to \nattract &quot;new blood&quot;, \n&gt; I think a=\r\nctivities such as the &quot;introduction to sword handling&quot; \nlecture \n&gt; might pe=\r\nrhaps be expanded and publicized.

This list and a shinsa  \n&gt; should=\r\n be a serious opportunity for learning. I hope that people \ncan  \n&gt; learn f=\r\nrom a shinsa. I also encourage everyone to ask questions.  \n&gt; There were to=\r\no few people who picked up their pieces and did not \nask  \n&gt; for an explana=\r\ntion. Next time, if there is one for you, ask the \nguy  \n&gt; taking your mone=\r\ny to call me over. I will be happy, or not, to  \n&gt; explain anything you wan=\r\nt to know. That is why we are doing a \nshinsa.  \n&gt; Not to make you feel bad=\r\n, but to try and share some knowledge \nwith  \n&gt; you. If I was hard on Ted, =\r\nI am sorry. If Ted would like to \ncontact  \n&gt; me off line, I would be happy=\r\n to help him understand his results. \nWe  \n&gt; are doing another shinsa in Ch=\r\nicago next April. Please use this  \n&gt; opportunity to learn. Also, if anyone=\r\n would like to volunteer to \nhelp  \n&gt; out along with Milt, let me know and =\r\nyou can share in the process.\n&gt; \n&gt; Gordon\n&gt; \n&gt; On Sep 7, 2006, at 11:46 AM,=\r\n nihontochicken wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Ron Har=\r\ntmann&quot; &lt;swords@&gt;  \n&gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Anyone got anything to report on the sw=\r\nord show and shinsa \nthat took\n&gt; &gt; &gt; place this past weekend???\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Yea=\r\nh, the judges were entirely unreasonable and were pinking juyo\n&gt; &gt; quality =\r\nswords.
