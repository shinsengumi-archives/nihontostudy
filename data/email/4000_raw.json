One was iron of very nice work with gold inlay in\nsnowflake patterns, but the colour of the iron was odd.  It just didn&#39;t &quot;look\nright&quot;.  It was sort of greyish.  I commented on this and the fellow freely\nadmitted he had cleaned and restored the tsuba with gun blue... GONG...  I kept\nthe tanto.  I just want to highlight Jim&#39;s advice that colour is probably the\nmost difficult kantei datum.  This also applies to shakudo.  I won&#39;t buy\nanything in soft metal unless the colour is right, as there were so many grades\nof quality - 15, if I recall correctly, for shakudo alone...\n\nSo for me it is a combination of the art level of a piece (quality of work) and\ncolour and condition of the metal.  I offer for your inspection a pair of menuki\nI have of Nio.  Now, I know these are almost identical to repro menuki sold by\nFred Lohman, and I got a real shock to see these in his catalogue.  However,\nmine are real as I have an NBTHK old green paper attributing them to Mito kuni.\nI sent them to the first USA NBTHK Shinsa way back when.  Here is the link:\n\nhttp://ph.groups.yahoo.com/group/nihontostudy/photos/browse/301b?c\n\nI&#39;ve put a couple of other menuki there as well.  A pair of Yanagawa tigers\n(papered) and a pair of Goto shishi (not papered - my guess as to school)\n\nThe NIO menuki I found in a sword that was otherwise a crapper in every respect.\nThe wakizashi blade had a humungously bad dragon carved to hide a flaw (it\ndidn&#39;t!!).  The tsuba was a rank, and I mean RANK, very ordinaire piece of scrap\nmetal (but old, mates, old...).  The fuchigashira were crudely made plain brass,\nand the saya was a leather over wood WW2 &#39;creation&#39;.  But I could easily see\nthese menuki were SUPERB.  I could never understand why and how they came to be\nthere amongst the dross...\n\nThe Yanagawa tiger menuki were likewise in an otherwise very ordinary wakizashi\nin gunto &quot;civilian&quot; koshirae.\n\nI bought a katana just to get the Goto shishi menuki.  The blade was signed\nNOBUKUNI and dated to 1400-something.  BUT - the hamon dropped off the cutting\nedge and the nakago was savagely rusted.  This was a severely tired old blade.\nThe tsuba was a Shonai iron piece with Shoki the demon queller.  All the\npatinated metal on the tsuba had been polished back to bright copper.  Now, some\n30 years later, it is looking quite decent.  The shishi menuki, however, were\nmint apart from some &quot;lashings&quot; of a solvent glue used to hold the tsukaito\ntogether.\n\nBest regards,\n\nBarry Thomas\n(Melbourne, Australia)\n\n==============================================\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &quot;Jim Gilbert&quot; &lt;jggilbert@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Thursday, March 16, 2006 3:33 PM\nSubject: Re: [nihontostudy] color of Momoyama Kanayama tsuba\n\n\nSteven,\nColor is probably the most difficult kantei datum.  The color of iron tsuba has\noften been changed (passively or actively), it depends on the light used to view\nor photograph and depends very much on the perception of the observer.  I would\nsuggest concentrating on everything else in dating Kanayama tsuba before\nconsidering color.\n\nWith that caution, I think that early Kanayama do not tend to show a reddish\ntone.  Not all Momoyama ones are reddish in my experience, but some are.  So,\nthe observation is valid, but it is not definitive in my opinion.\n\nIf you do try to evaluate iron color use direct but not dazzling sunlight.\n\nJim\n\n"
