Apps such as Photoshop \n&gt;   excel a=\r\nt this and also XnView which is free is a very good option. I \n&gt;   work in =\r\nFilm and Television so this is something I am quite experienced \n&gt;   in (as=\r\n is Jim G our fearless leader)\n&gt; \n&gt;   I think there would be a good interes=\r\nt in the US and a lesser \n&gt;   international interest though selling any for=\r\nm of book to the younger \n&gt;   generation seems a daunting task.

One thing I woul=\r\nd \n&gt;   &gt; suggest is\n&gt;   &gt; &gt; getting a little smarter with your photos as th=\r\ne page takes a long time\n&gt;   &gt; &gt; to load. I down loaded one photo and it is=\r\n 2.3 meg.
