It&#39;s hard to see much of the character of the plate itself.  Silver fukurin aren&#39;t common on older pieces, but this one doesn&#39;t look so new.  There are some early tachi koshirae with silver fittings.  The size and shape seem OK for mounting on a nagamaki, but I haven&#39;t seen many old nagamaki koshirae for comparison.  The namako sukashi (now filled) make me wonder if it was previously mounted on a sword, and if so that would further confuse the time period.  On the other hand I wonder if the sukashi was made with the intention of adding lead fillings to increase the mass of the guard (lead is about 1.46x as dense as iron).\n\nSeeing it in person would help.  Might still be a puzzler.\n\nJim\n\n\n  Yeah, the yamagane tsuba is massive. I will have to measure it when I get a\n  chance. Your tsuba does look early to me. I think Jim would be the best\n  judge of that, however,\n\n  Gordon\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
