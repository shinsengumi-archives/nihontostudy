If it is not possible or practical\nto take a picture, you might consider taking it to a\nsword club near you.\n\nGiven the size and curvature of the blade, it is\nprobably a wakizashi or a naginata-naoshi (a halberd\nlike weapon that has been cut down to make an oversize\ntanto. &quot;O-tanto&quot; basically is a large or oversized\ntanto). The mounts sound fine to me. Many of these\ncame back as souevinirs with WW2 veterans. As they\nplayed with them over the years, parts &lt;handles,\nseppas, etc&gt; got mixed and matched.\n\nDon&#39;t mess with the blade using any cleaning\nchemicals. Despite the polish being gone and the edge\ndestroyed, there may be some life left to it.\n\nPlease share in what state or country you live, and we\nwill try to point you to a nearby sword society or\nclub.\n\nCurran\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--- bh325 &lt;bh325@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; Hello all,\n&gt; \n&gt; I am a new member, I am looking for information on a\n&gt; Japanese edged\n&gt; weapon that was gifted to me rather unexpectedly. I\n&gt; would like to find\n&gt; out as much information as I can about it, I suspect\n&gt; it may be a WWII\n&gt; era officer&#39;s weapon or it may be older than that.\n&gt; The blade polish\n&gt; has been completely destroyed, and the edge has been\n&gt; dulled. The tsuba\n&gt; is tarnished and much of the silver/gold decoration\n&gt; is missing. What I\n&gt; know about it:\n&gt; \n&gt; The blade is between 16-17 inches from end of tang\n&gt; to tip. It is\n&gt; curved, but the handle is nearly straight. The\n&gt; handle itself has been\n&gt; re-wrapped and re-covered with rayskin, and two\n&gt; spacers have been\n&gt; added between the Habaki and the tsuba, and the\n&gt; tsuba and the handle\n&gt; collar. These are not original, they look like they\n&gt; were taken from a\n&gt; much larger weapon. There is no idication of a\n&gt; hamon. The Habaki looks\n&gt; original and is copper, polished on top with\n&gt; diagonal file marks at\n&gt; the bottom and on the sides. \n&gt; \n&gt; The handle collar is copper and is marked with three\n&gt; symbols, two\n&gt; characters and a &quot;flower&quot; that is composed of a\n&gt; central circle and\n&gt; three semi-circular lobes. The handle cap is horn,\n&gt; and is original by\n&gt; my information. \n&gt; \n&gt; There are characters chisled into the tang, I\n&gt; attempted to take a\n&gt; rubbing but it wasn&#39;t successful. They are only one\n&gt; one side, but the\n&gt; reverse side has two small triangular notches near\n&gt; the top of the tang.\n&gt; \n&gt; I realize that no one would be able to tell much\n&gt; from the words, but\n&gt; maybe someone can inform me on how to best record\n&gt; and display the\n&gt; needed markings/information that would allow\n&gt; identification or any\n&gt; other information to be determined. \n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks in advance.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?
