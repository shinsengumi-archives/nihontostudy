Prices are a\nlittle different but I am getting them here in Japan\nwhile you have to ship them from here to the UK. I can\nbeat your shipping prices to the U.S. as I ship USPS\nbut for those who live in and around Europe you\nprobably have me beat on shipping not to mention\ndelivery time. So I&#39;m going to suggest that anyone\nthat lives in Europe that requests books from me I&#39;ll\nsend them to you first if you can&#39;t get it then I&#39;ll\nsee if I can fill their orders from here in Japan. So\nthis goes out to all you folks that buy books: Please\nif you live in Europe save yourself shipping costs and\ntime waiting and go through Alan you&#39;ll get a much\nbetter price that way not to mention you won&#39;t have to\nwait nearly as long to receive your order. As far as\nwhat books in my inventory that both Alan and I share\nand prices go here&#39;s what I&#39;ve got:\n\nMASAMUNE Sano Museum Exhibition  Catalogue 2002,\n8.75&quot;x11.5&quot; paper covers, 169pp illustrates 59 blades\nby both b&w plates and superb oshigata. The book\ncovers the Soshu trad- ition from Kunitsuna through\nMasamune to shinto makers like Shinkai and Kiyomaro.\nThere is a brief English index to the plates.       \nGBP32 = USD $53.70 \n\nMy Price: $50 USD + $10 USD shipping to the U.S.\n\nNIHON NO BIJUTSU #431 Swords From the Fujisawa\nCollection, by Hiroi, 7.25&quot;x9&quot; paper  covers, 106pp \nof which  are plates illustrating blades and mountings\ndonated to the NBTHK by Fujisawa Otoyasu.        \nGBP19 = USD $31.88\n\nMy Price: $35 USD + $4 USD for shipping to the U.S.\n(Might have to lower my price to compete on this one)\n\nSOSOKI NO NIHONTO Early curved Japanese Swords. Sano\nMuseum Exhibition Catalogue 2003. 8.75&quot;x11.5&quot; soft\ncovers. 139pp illustrating 59 very early blades\nincluding rare Mogusa smiths, Hoki Yasutsuna, Bungo\nYukihira and Sadahide, Choen, Kuninaga & Kanenaga.\nExplores and explains the origins of curved blades\nfrom the Heian to the early Kamakura period. English\nindex for the plates.\nGBP32 = USD $53.70\n\nMy Price: $50 USD + $10 USD shipping to the U.S.\n(This one&#39;s not listed on my site but I have it)\n\nSATSUMA KOSHIRAE by Zusho, 62x8.5&quot;, 129pp of which 38\nare plates (16 in colour) illustrating the various\ntypes of sword mountings po[pular in Satsuma, plus\n16pp of illustrations from the Satsuma auction sale\ncatalogue of 1928.\nGBP31 = USD $52.02\n\nMy Price: $55 USD + $4 USD shipping to the U.S.\n(Might have to lower my price to compete on this one) \n\nI&#39;m hoping that after the holidays or during my off\ntime during the holiday break I&#39;ll get a chance to\nupdate my site. But if anyone has any questions please\ndrop me an email and ask.\n\nBob R\n\n=====\nCheck out &quot;Cowboy&quot; Bob&#39;s Books & Things at:\nhttp://asia.geocities.com/gentleman9/index.html\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nProtect your identity with Yahoo!
