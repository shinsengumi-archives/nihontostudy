I don&#39;t know much about jade, but your example looks much better than those.  The Metropolitan Museum of art in NY has a somewhat similar Chinese sword on display with a polished, undecorated (but very colorful) agate guard.  Some of the early Chinese swords found in Japan have similarly shaped metal guards, although without carved decoration.  \n\nI have one of these metal guards that a friend gave me years ago.  Pictures here:\nhttp://tinyurl.com/g9hw\n\nFWIW,\nJim\n\n\n\n  http://www.kaikodo.com/cgi/salonobject.cgi?id=5\n  &lt;http://www.kaikodo.com/cgi/salonobject.cgi?id=5&detail=off&type=co&gt;\n  &detail=off&type=co\n\n  I know it is not japanese sword related, but still thought some of you\n  might find this interesting. I have been interested in Chinese art for\n  over 10 years and have never seen one of these before !\n\n  Jade tsuba ?? Hmmmmm \n\n  In any case if it does not belong here, please delete the post.\n\n  - Matt \n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
