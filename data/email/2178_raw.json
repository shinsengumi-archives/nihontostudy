The\n  protectors are beaten, patinated, lacquered =\r\nand adorned with golden\n  figures from famous Japanese war stories. The wor=\r\nkmanship makes\n  Faberg=E9 look almost amateur.\n\n  The sword fittings are f=\r\nrom the collection of Alexander G. Mosl=E9, a\n  German businessman who work=\r\ned in Japan from 1884 to 1907. As the\n  representative of the Gruson Compan=\r\ny, a subsidiary of Krupp Steel,\n  Mosl=E9 was able to persuade the Japanese=\r\n government to switch from\n  French to German arms just as Japan was assert=\r\ning itself as a\n  military power. (The first Sino-Japanese War was in 1894-=\r\n95 and the\n  Russo-Japanese War in 1904-05.)\n\n  The arms trade made Mosl=E9=\r\n wealthy; at one point he had 2,249\n  Japanese swords, armor, more than 1,6=\r\n00 sword fittings, Japanese\n  paintings, prints, sculptures, ceramics, lacq=\r\nuer and textiles. Mosl=E9\n  retired in 1907 and returned to Germany, workin=\r\ng with scholars and\n  dealers to learn more about his collection. In 1909 h=\r\ne exhibited it\n  at the K=F6nigliches Kunstgewerbe Museum in Berlin. It was=\r\n published\n  in two catalogs in 1914, which are still considered important\n=\r\n  reference works.\n\n  In the late 1920&#39;s, Mosl=E9 traveled to the United St=\r\nates to try to\n  sell his collection to public institutions. He did sell so=\r\nme prints\n  to the Art Institute of Chicago and some lacquers to the Freer\n=\r\n  Gallery of Art in Washington, but, apparently, little more. He was\n  in t=\r\nhe United States in 1941, when America went to war, and was\n  stranded here=\r\n. Sometime before his death in 1949, he entered a\n  mental institution.\n\n  =\r\nHis bank organized a sale of his Japanese works at Parke-Bernet in\n  New Yo=\r\nrk in 1948, including the fittings in this sale. These 170\n  works have bee=\r\nn in private hands since that earlier sale. They\n  include simple designs m=\r\nade of iron and ceremonial sets embellished\n  with gold, silver and copper.=\r\n They range in price from a few\n  thousand to a few hundred thousand dollar=\r\ns apiece.\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
