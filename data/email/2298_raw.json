It turns out that it is a haiku peom written by \nBaishitsu (1769-1852), and it means reads &quot;Various impressions are \ngiven to me every time the scenery of the season where the plum tree \nblooms is seen&quot;. \n\nThere is also asignature which I am told is the engraver of the \nhaiku poem, &quot;Yoshitame&quot;.  Does anyone know who this person was or \nwhat school he engraved for?\n\nDoes anyone have information on this tsuba?\n\nHere is the link:\n\nhttp://www.japaneseswordcollector.com/tsuba.jpg\n\nThanks in advance.\n\nRegards,\n\nLouis \n\n\n\n\n"
