I \nthought it was Yoshi something to begin with.\n\nFor our tsuba experts here, In Tsuba, an Aesthetic guide it states that \nthe first Umetada smiths signed with a different characture for Ume. \nThey used ?. Then a little later on they changed to ?, the same i think \nas is on my mei. Then a little later on again, they changed back to ? or \nused a plum rebus instead of a kanji in the place of Ume. The book does \nnot give the dates for these changes but I assume it was in the late \nKoto/early Edo period, around the time of the First or second \ngenerations. The other thing is that it may be is Ko-Umetada but I am \nlooking further into that.\n\nany thought&#39;s on this ??\n\nRich\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
