I take photos of Greek \nand Roman coins up close.  I shouldn&#39;t have too much problems.  I will \nprobably take a White sheet of paper to set the item on.  I use \nPhotoShop LE for cropping, sizing, and Adjusting.  I will double check \nthe photos when I&#39;m there and at least I have Sunday to go back and take \nmore photos.  Tuesday is when it will go up for Auction.\n\nThank you all,\nKim\n\nBarry Thomas wrote:\n\n&gt;Kim,\n&gt;Hope you don&#39;t mind a tip or ten!!  This advice is based on the assumption that\n&gt;you are going to use a digital camera.\n&gt;- Use the highest resolution your camera is capable of.\n&gt;- Study the User Manual for a CLOSEUP option use if your camera has the\n&gt;function.\n&gt;- Get AS MUCH of the object you want in the image (LCDscreen or viewfinder)\n&gt;before taking the pic.  This gives you more pixels on what you want people to\n&gt;see.\n&gt;- Take as many pics as you can from different angles and distances.  It is no\n&gt;joy to get home and find all your images (or the otherwise best ones) are out of\n&gt;focus or have reflections off a glass case (the camera always sees what the eye\n&gt;does not!!).\n&gt;- Find out how to increase the exposure of your camera if it has the function.\n&gt;Take extra images at +0.5, +1.0 or even +1.5 if the lighting is not bright\n&gt;enough.\n&gt;- Unload and carefully view all images with an image view application.  I use a\n&gt;rather simple program called Microsoft PhotoEditor.  It is basic but allows\n&gt;viewing at up to 400x but I hardly use any more than 150x - if your image is\n&gt;beginning to pixellate at 125x then it doesn&#39;t have enough resolution.\n&gt;- PhotoEditor allows one to rotate and crop images for best presentation and\n&gt;viewing so people can concentrate on what you want them to see.\n&gt;- Preserve the original images by renaming any image you manipulate with a\n&gt;meaningful name. Resave at the highest resolution possible - the jpeg save\n&gt;option in PhotoEditor, for example, should be at 100% to preserve image quality.\n&gt;- I&#39;m a rank amatuer, but if you&#39;re a professional photographer I apologise for\n&gt;the imposition...\n&gt;\n&gt;Finally, don&#39;t post large file sizes to the list.  Put them on a hosting site\n&gt;somewhere.\n&gt;\n&gt;Reply off-line if I can be of further assistance.\n&gt;\n&gt;Best regards,\n&gt;\n&gt;Barry Thomas.\n&gt;\n&gt;----- Original Message -----\n&gt;From: &quot;Kim Ghobrial&quot; &lt;imports@...&gt;\n&gt;To: &lt;nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt;Sent: Saturday, July 09, 2005 11:53 AM\n&gt;Subject: Re: [nihontostudy] RE: Question....\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Hi Barry,\n&gt;Thank you, I&#39;ll take some photos tomorrow and post them for everyone to see.\n&gt;\n&gt;Kim\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;Yahoo!
