Seems that with\nage gunk gets in all the textures of them. I&#39;m not\nsure that I won&#39;t get flamed for this but I found that\na wooden toothpick to pick out the big stuff and then\na very soft-headed toothbrush and some water helps to\nbreak up and get rid of the rest of it. I&#39;m not sure\nif this is a good or sanctioned way to do it but it\nworked for me.\n\nBob R\n\n--- Ron Hartmann &lt;swords@...&gt; wrote:\n\nLooking closer, I suspect the nanako has\n&gt; become smooth in places not from wear, but from\n&gt; clogging caused by oily dirt.  I&#39;m curious if any of\n&gt; you have found a &quot;safe&quot; way to remove this oily dirt\n&gt; buildup.   \n\n=====\nCheck out &quot;Cowboy&quot; Bob&#39;s Books & Things at:\nhttp://asia.geocities.com/gentleman9/index.html\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nThe New Yahoo!
