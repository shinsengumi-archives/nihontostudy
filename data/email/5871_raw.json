As it can be expensive to deliver single articles by shipping them Sea Freight, some over-long items are not prudent to send abroad. Pole arms can, however, have the shaft cut in half and very simply re-affixed at the destination [either personally, by the buyer, or by a basic carpenter]. This has been the accepted method of transporting pole arms for many, many, years and is perfectly suitable and effective.\n\nThis is from The Lanes Armoury in Brighton, UK, I have never heard of this before but then I don&#39;t ship yari.\n\nAlan\n\n--\nI am using the free version of SPAMfighter.\nWe are a community of 7 million users fighting spam.\nSPAMfighter has removed 9 of my spam emails to date.\nGet the free SPAMfighter here: http://www.spamfighter.com/len\n\nThe Professional version does not have this message\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
