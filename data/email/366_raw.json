Searching on google.com I find this shrine is in Kasama north of Tokyo.  \n\nMy question is this.  Having this name carved on the blade as it is, would this indicate the sword had some association with this shrine or perhaps that the Owner had some association with this shrine?  I realize there might not be a positive answer to this question but I&#39;d be interested to read your comments and opinions either way.  (The other side of the sword has a particularly beautiful &quot;dragon/ken&quot; carved within a very wide, short bo hi.  The dragon is noticably &quot;tightly wrapped&quot; around the ken, an obvious characteristic [style/representation/form?] I have yet to fine illustrated elsewhere.)  The mumei, short (25&quot;) ubu katana was given 78 pts. and attributed to Bizen Heiuezaimon Tadamitsu, Eisho (ca. 1504) during the September 2001 shinsa hosted by Chris Bowen.  \n\nComments?\n\nRon\nSTL\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
