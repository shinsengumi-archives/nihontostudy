I put them up at:\n&gt;\n&gt; http://tinyurl.com/d2ee\n&gt;\n&gt; His description:\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Attached are the pix of that leather nagamaki tsuba I was telling you\nabout.  It is 3.5  inches in diameter and .25 inches thick.  It is made from\ntwo pieces of leather and it appears that there may be a fabric covering\nunder the lacquer..you can see a weave looking design on the edges where the\nlacquer is cracked away.  This particular tsuba fit on the pole about a foot\nbehind the blade.  There is a four pointed iron guard device that goes in\nfront of it.  I don&#39;t have the whole pole, but I do have all the forward\nparts.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Jim\n&gt;\n\n\n"
