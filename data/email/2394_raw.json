The story about special\npresentation fittings is most likely bs too - if you want an opinion\nit&#39;s possible if you provide some pictures.\n\nIf there is a swastika on the scabbard - it&#39;s a chinese fake. If you\ncan find a sword on e-bay that looks 100% like yours - it&#39;s a chinese\nfake.\n\n\n&gt; No problem, I dont know what I have it wasnt what I bought in the \n&gt; auction ... lol .. and everyone here abouts has his own opinion, but \n&gt; I rather get the opinions of true collector, that why the post.\n&gt; Ran\n\n\n\n\n\n"
