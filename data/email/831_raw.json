We don&#39;t see these types of mounts very often - if ever \nreally.  The carving work is very intricate, and this is a pretty \nold set.  The blade is very old with 4 holes in the nakago, it is \nsigned Yoshimitsu, but the signature has been welded on.  It also \nhas a few openings on the surface.\n\nI will have a more detailed description on ebay.  If you have any \nquestions please feel free to ask, I also have many pictures of it.\n\nHere is a link to some pictures:\n\nhttp://members.rogers.com/rskeboa170/efu/index.html\n\nRegards,\n\nLouis \n\n\n"
