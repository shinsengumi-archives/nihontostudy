Not to say it&#39;s the same type, but it reminds me a bit of the early type of tsuba with a dragon carved down into a plain plate like the 3rd (last) guard here:\nhttp://home.earthlink.net/~jggilbert/kamakura.htm\n\nSome sources call that kind of guard the beginning of the Kamakura-bori style, others see it as an elaboration of the Tosho or Katchushi style.  Both may be correct, in that a one-off experiment could grow into a &quot;school.&quot;  Or both may be wrong and the pieces were made by someone or a group that had no actual connection with the makers of what look to us as likely pre or post styles.  \n\nAlan mentioned Hizen -- was that because of the style of the dragon?\n\nJim\n\n\n  Jim -\n\n  Thanks. The dragon, etc could just be very, very low \n  relief carving. I really can&#39;t tell. If it&#39;s not Saotome,\n  what other schools might it be? \n\n  Rich\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
