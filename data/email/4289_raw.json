It is a beautiful Mino\n  &gt; Shakudo Tsuba. I believe the kogai ana is filled\n  &gt; with\n  &gt; copper. It has nice nanako. The edge is completely\n  &gt; filled with leaves and flowers,etc. The only really\n  &gt; weird thing is that the seppa-dai must have be put\n  &gt; on\n  &gt; a pole weapon or something. It has notches put in\n  &gt; and\n  &gt; the nakaga ana has been widened. Questions, where\n  &gt; would you classify this? I was thinking mid-edo, \n  &gt; but\n  &gt; what would you look for in ko-mino work? I have\n  &gt; been\n  &gt; looking for a piece like this for a long time and I\n  &gt; think I did well on the purchase.
