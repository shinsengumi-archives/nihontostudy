It&#39;s a kind of shiiremono that\ncopied Mino/Goto style.  These fittings are often marketed as &quot;Mino Goto,&quot;\nbut the quality of the materials and workmanship is not at that level of\nwork.\n\nThe problem is not that they have been cleaned, but that they are not made\nout of shakudo.  This type of fitting is often coated with a thin black wash\nto simulate shakudo, but that is often worn away from the seppa dai.  The\nnanako is more coarse than would be seen in genuine Mino or Goto work.\nRather than using gold inlay/overlay a thin gold wash is used.  Where this\nis rubbed on the high spots the underlying copper shows through.  The\nquality of the carving is not at the level Mino or Goto work.\n\nAs Ron says there is a continuum of this type of material ranging from very\npoor to pretty good.  The distinction between lower quality Mino-bori and\nhigher quality Nagoya-mono can be pretty fuzzy.\n\nI doubt that the fuchigashira and tsuba are by the same person.  The details\nof the carving of the peony  are quite different.  They are the same type of\nwork though.  They&#39;re probably from the late Edo period.  There are quite a\nfew wakizashi mounted with this style of tosogu.\n\nJim\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Ron and readers,\n&gt;\n&gt; It seems like your impression has its followers. Someone on Rich Turners\n&gt; message board agreed on Mino Goto, and they are probably made from the\n&gt; same hand. However he also said the set had been cleaned and should be\n&gt; repatinated by an expert. I donï¿½t see the damage but what do I know.:)\n&gt; I decided to take photos of the menukis as well. However they do not\n&gt; seem to match the rest of the fittings. What is your opinion on them?\n&gt;\n&gt; Here is the menukis.\n&gt; http://hem.bredband.net/odrike/Menuki2.htm\n&gt;\n&gt; Here is the rest of the fittings again.\n&gt; http://hem.bredband.net/odrike/Tosogu1.htm\n&gt;\n&gt; Fredrik\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Ron Hartmann wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;Fredrik -\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Not having the pictures in front of me at this moment, my impression\nearlier was that they were the work of Mino Goto, same period. Maybe Jim\nGilbert is watching and can elaborate on this for you.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Ron\n\n\n"
