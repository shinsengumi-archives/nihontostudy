Lovely little piece but I was particularly struck by the koshirae. I am guessing Goto,  I was discussing this with Barry Thomas and his guess was Mino Goto. Maybe Jim G could shed some light on it.\n\nI was also curious about the papers, would they be Seikeido&#39;s own kantei papers ?.\n\nhttp://www.seikeido.com/seikeido/1kanezumi.htm\n\nThe have some excellent tsuba and some wonderful swords.
