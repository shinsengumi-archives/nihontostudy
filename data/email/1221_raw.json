A lot of the old European collections had big, \nheavily wrapped Shingen tsuba.  Whoever was making them seems to have \ncreated a market.\n&gt; \n&gt; Jim\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   Hi Rich;\n&gt; \n&gt;   Offhand Shingen is the only one that comes to mind.  This one \nseems a bit unusual, as they mostly covered the whole sukashi plate \nin wire.  Some of the tsuba they used were very good sukashi tsuba.\n&gt; \n&gt;   John\n&gt;     \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;     cheers John, I have seen them with the usual rail/nail type of \npattern but not like this, was wire used as a decoration often ?.\n&gt; \n&gt;     Rich\n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
