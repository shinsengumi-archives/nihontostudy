The Chicago show if \n&gt; upon us this coming weekend. Anybody bringing anything particularly \n&gt; exciting for sale or just show-and-tell??? I do know the \n&gt; NBTHK-American branch will have an exciting Horikawa school display \n&gt; for our fondling pleasure. My contribution will be a large and \n&gt; exciting naginata by Horikawa Kunimichi with horimono. Bob Benson has \n&gt; been busy rounding up a number of great examples of the school&#39;s \n&gt; works, so it should be both an educational and visually pleasing display.\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m not sure just yet what I&#39;ll bring for sharing. That depends on my \n&gt; level of energy, but most likely I&#39;ll have a couple of Juyo daito \n&gt; along and maybe a recently polished gendai naginata, a rarity. So stop \n&gt; by and say hello and don&#39;t be bashful about asking to see these \n&gt; beautiful treasures! They&#39;re what it&#39;s all about! Nothing very &quot;fresh&quot; \n&gt; for my table, but nice things irregardless, and all &quot;open for offers&quot; \n&gt; if at all possible. I&#39;ll have our latest KTK 2009 publication \n&gt; available and maybe a number of excellent (an somewhat pricey) tosogu \n&gt; and sword related books, too.\n&gt;\n&gt; Any signed/dated Jirotaro swords or tsuba coming??? Remember me.\n&gt;\n&gt; Ron\n&gt; STL\n&gt;\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n&gt; \n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
