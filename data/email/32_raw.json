I studdied for about 3 years before my back and knees go the better of me, I was always taught to be careful fitting new tsuba to my sword as the slightest change in the swords balance can effect the cut. I also think that an unbalaced sword would be hard on the arms after say 100 or more cuts. A Katana is fairly hard work with one hand and I would think the lighter the better.\n\nDoes anyone know if Big Tom is on board or knows about this list ?\n\ncheers all\n\nRich\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: Jim Gilbert \n  To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Thursday, April 24, 2003 3:33 AM\n  Subject: Re: [nihontostudy] tsuba balance\n\n\n  Rich,\n  It sounds plausible.  I&#39;m not a sword user and I&#39;m not sure who here is or\n  isn&#39;t, but I wonder how much influence the weight of a tsuba right next to\n  the hand has on the feel or balance of the sword.  Does anyone have\n  practical experience with how varying the weight of the guard affects the\n  feel or function of a given sword?\n  Jim\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
