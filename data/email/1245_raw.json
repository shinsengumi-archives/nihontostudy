(Mine begin with 1984, wouldn&#39;t you know.)\n\nMr. Yoshikawa held an NTHK shinsa in Chicago as part of the Token Study Group/JSSUS joint-effort, Token Kai 1979. Often, the NTHK would publish a report on their U.S.A. shinsa and feature a few interesting items for publication. I am interested in finding out if in ther report on this 1979 shinsa, if by chance they published oshigata of any Yokoyama Bizen Sukenaga swords. \n\nIn the Chicago Token Study Group report (listing of results) that was distrubuted in 1981, three shinshin-to Yokoyama Bizen Sukenaga went through shinsa. One, a katana with kiku mon, reached 78 points and the other two, a katana and wakizashi, reached 75 points. I&#39;m interested to see oshigata of the two 75 point swords although if any were illustrated, it would likely be the 78 pointer. \n\nProbably a hopeless quest for information but...   Contact me privately if you wish: swords@...      Thanks!\n\nRon\nSTL \n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
