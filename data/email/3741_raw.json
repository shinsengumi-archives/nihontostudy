I had a look in Toso Kodogu Meiji Taikan and \nWakayama shows one example there. The kanji for both Guro and Mori are \nquite different. The Guro is well separated in all the strokes on John&#39;s \nexample and the the published mei is quite compact and tight.. The mori \nis also think and tight in Wakayama&#39;s but on John&#39;s piece, quite wide. \nAlso the Kao looks a bit different as well.\n\nSo, after all that, not sure. Some of these guys changed their mei as \nthey aged, or matured.\n\nCheers\n\nRich\n\n\n\nCraig Harris wrote:\n&gt; John,\n&gt;\n&gt; Haynes lists two Ishiguro Masamori that signed with these kanji, H\n&gt; 04225.0 and H 04227.0 - the first said to be a student of the first\n&gt; Ishiguro Masatsune (H 04751.0)  but an independent artist, but the\n&gt; name was also used by the second Ishiguro Masatsune H 04752.0. The\n&gt; second Masamori listing appears to be for a student of the second\n&gt; Ishiguro Mastasune who died ca. 1800.\n&gt;\n&gt; The photos are a bit blurry - or maybe it&#39;s my eyes - and I&#39;m no\n&gt; authority on the signature. There should be examples in Wakayama that\n&gt; someone can look up, my copies are in the warehouse.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --\n&gt; Craig Harris\n&gt; Books from and about Asia\n&gt; www.bridgeofdreams.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; On 1/18/06, excelsiorilluminati &lt;excelsiorilluminati@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;   \n&gt;&gt; Hi All, Could someone tell me more about Masamori of Ishiguro school.\n&gt;&gt; I&#39;m told there were three.
