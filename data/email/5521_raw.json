Many years ago, Hal K. used to\nfrequent the sword shows. Some may rem=\r\nember him.\n10 or more years ago he sold a Heianjo tsuba (Large round solid =\r\nplate\nwith mixed soft metal flowers) to a guy either at the Chicago or\nFlor=\r\nida show. In cleaning up his stuff, he has come across the papers\nfor that =\r\ntsuba, and would love to unite them with the owner now.\nSo if anyone thinks=\r\n they may have it, pop into\nhttp://www.militaria.co.za/nmb/viewtopic.php?f=\r\n=3D9&t=3D4551 for a pic and\nsee if you can get your origami 10 years later =\r\n:-)\n\nBrian\n\n\n"
