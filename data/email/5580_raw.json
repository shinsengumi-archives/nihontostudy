These iny=F4kon posts continued until\n  the late Muromachi per=\r\niod into the Momoyama period. They are also seen on\n  generally high class =\r\nworks for the mid to late Edo period; however, they no\n  longer went all th=\r\ne way through the tsuka and basically worked as the newer\n  chikara-gane do=\r\n. As noted, strength and metal is the literal translation,\n  but more accur=\r\nately I would call them reinforced/strengthened tabs of\n  typically copper.=\r\n On an added note, at least the first three generations of\n  the main line =\r\nGoto masters are said to have only used iny=F4kon posts and\n  menuki withou=\r\nt them will typically be attributed to Ko-Goto rather than one\n  of the mai=\r\nn guys. I expect we will be catching up with many on the list in\n  San Fran=\r\ncisco next month. I am certainly looking forward to it.\n\n  Gordon\n\n  _____ =\r\n\n\n  From: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com [mailto:nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com=\r\n] On\n  Behalf Of Ron Hartmann\n  Sent: Thursday, July 09, 2009 3:28 AM\n  To:=\r\n TOKEN; nihonto@yahoogroups.com; nihontostudy\n  Subject: [nihontostudy] Fw:=\r\n Sword term meaning...\n\n  Okay, I jumped too soon on this question.
