With the \nexception of the =\r\nGoto there doesn&#39;t seem to be too much of a record.  \nNow there was a recor=\r\nd of the sword smiths.  This is why I question \nthe &#39;relative&#39; value of the=\r\n tsubako before Edo.  After the civil war \nperiod artistic merit became mor=\r\ne important and all of a sudden we \nsee records of the tsubako.  It may be =\r\npossible that we are \ndogmatizing the whole iron tsuba field, in other word=\r\ns making it more \nimportant than it was ever viewed by the people of those =\r\ntimes.  Now \nit is also important to remember that there is nothing wrong w=\r\nith \nrecognizing artistic beauty where it was not appreciated before.  I \nj=\r\nust have to wonder if sometimes we are overdoing it, that&#39;s all.  \nThe &#39;bea=\r\nutiful&#39; tekotsu bumplies on the mimi were just not worth the \ntime or effor=\r\nt to smooth off, and the &#39;surface texturing&#39; was done to \nhide the irregula=\r\nrities in the metal.  \n\n\n\n\n\n--- In nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com, &quot;bungotaka=\r\ndasword&quot; \n&lt;MuramasaIII@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com,=\r\n &quot;klepet33319&quot; &lt;Ppeterdds@&gt; \n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; OK -- now this is heresy, bla=\r\nsphemy, and possibly a bit of \nidolitry \n&gt; &gt; throwm in for good measure.  I=\r\ns it possible that the tekotsu we \nsee \n&gt; in \n&gt; &gt; the early guards is from =\r\ntheir being made from scraps of steel \nleft \n&gt; &gt; over from swordmaking or o=\r\nther purposes and the admixture of \n&gt; different \n&gt; &gt; pieces led to the incl=\r\nussions of differing densities and \n&gt; furthermore \n&gt; &gt; that the relative un=\r\nimportance of the guard to the sword made the \n&gt; bumps \n&gt; &gt; around the ede =\r\na moot issue?  It seems that later on when the \n&gt; &gt; craftsmanship went up t=\r\nhe tekotsu went away.  Oh boy, I&#39;m going \nto \n&gt; get \n&gt; &gt; it from this one!\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; Pete,\n&gt; I think you have some valid ideas there......... we jaw break=\r\ners \nfall \n&gt; into rank , don&#39;t we ??!!\n&gt; Consider the hardness of the OLD g=\r\nuards eg. Onin etc., we don&#39;t see \n&gt; that type of iron in mid/late Edo days=\r\n ( till the revival days of \n&gt; shinshinto ).\n&gt; \n&gt; milt\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n"
