The first give away=\r\n is that it is being sold from china, the other give aways include the tang=\r\n, signature, shape of the blade and kissaki, fake fittings etc.\n \nSince you=\r\n are new to collecting, I suggest going to Rich Stein, and Rich Turners web=\r\n sites and looking under the &quot;fake sword&quot; sections, they are every informat=\r\nive and will save you alot of money.\n \nPlease buy from a reputable dealer o=\r\nr someone you know.  If buying from ebay check feedback and stay away from =\r\nany auctions out of china,  99.99 percent of them are junk and outright lia=\r\nrs.\n \nGood luck,\n \nLouis\n\njock1307 &lt;jock1307@...&gt; wrote:\nHi,\n\nsince I=\r\n am new to this forum ( and new to collecting japanese \nswords ;-) ) first =\r\nof all I=B4d like to send my greetings to you\nfrom Germany (Trier) and than=\r\nk everybody for many valuable infos \nposted on this board.\n\nI=B4ve seen a t=\r\nanto on ebay \n\nhttp://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?\nViewItem&category=3D43=\r\n338&item=3D2263805803\n\nthe koshirae look quite interresting to me and espec=\r\nially on the \npicture showing the kissaki there is some hada and a faint ha=\r\nmon \nvisible though a possible yokote (i=B4m not sure if a yokote is\nbeing =\r\nplaced on tantos) seems to be ground away due to improper \npolishing.\n\nPlea=\r\nse excuse if what I presume is complete nonsense - it is as I \nwrote - I=B4=\r\nm a newbie...\n\nbye and thanx\n\nC.
