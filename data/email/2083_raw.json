As far as my memory can be trusted, I think that it&#39;s a mid to late Edo period thing.  I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve seen it on Goto work, only machibori.  Those machibori examples have been by fairly to very big names.  I don&#39;t know of any school pattern or lineage behind it, but there could well be one (or maybe it was just a fashion).  I have the sense that it&#39;s often seen along with tanzaku mei (the signatures done on small plaques), but I don&#39;t know of any reason for that.  I don&#39;t think that I&#39;ve seen the star piece soldered down like a true root.  It seems more like it is there to cover up the joint between the post and the back of the menuki.  (&quot;Rootless&quot; posts were also popular with machibori kinko during this time.)  Maybe it is soldered down but the solder is kept away from the edges.  If someone was out to create a forgery from scratch it&#39;d be pretty easy to add these to enhance the fake if appropriate.  If just putting on a gimei or inserting a gimei tanzaku I don&#39;t know if the faker would bother with it.\n\nThat&#39;s all I can think of right now and without doing research on it.  Does anyone know of any specific examples contradicting the above or of an existing analysis that explains what they&#39;re all about?\n\nAnd yes, Shozui is the usual romanization.  With a long o.\nJim\n\n\n\n\n  Jim - \n\n  A pair on Nio menuki here--purchased by my wife years ago from Bill Shapland, as a surprise--have a star-shaped roots for their pegs. I also have a large pair of &quot;running boar&quot; menuki signed Shozui which have the same star-shape roots. Not holding out that these are correct as signed, but I have seen this thing on at least one pair of menuki by Shozui (am I spelling this right?). Any comment on the use of this star-shape roots? Characteristic of any era or maker? Just curious. \n\n  Ron\n  STL\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
