I seem to remember one of \nthem being rathe=\r\nr good. They may have just been Koshirae, the grey \nmatter is fading :-)\n\nR=\r\nich\n\n\n\nRon Hartmann wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi all -\n&gt;\n&gt; Quiet weekend. Thought I&#39;d ask =\r\nif anyone knows of any factual articles \n&gt; or simply some background inform=\r\nation on those miniature &quot;Boys swords&quot; \n&gt; that we sometimes see from time t=\r\no time. Some of these appear pretty \n&gt; low-end quality while on occasion, s=\r\nome real workmanship shows up.\n&gt;\n&gt; Personally, I&#39;ve never had much interest=\r\n in these but recently, a very \n&gt; nice quality one was brought to me here i=\r\nn St. Louis by an antique \n&gt; appraiser friend. Now I own it. What impressed=\r\n me was the nice quality \n&gt; of the fittings, the baleen wrapping and a very=\r\n handsome, well forged \n&gt; blade. The blade appears to be signed Bizen Osafu=\r\nne Morimitsu and is \n&gt; dated Oei 5 but more likely, from what I&#39;ve gathered=\r\n, it is more \n&gt; likely a shinshinto creation made as a Morimitsu. Hamon is =\r\na narrow \n&gt; suguha with ko-nei with a boshi swept in ko-nie (hakikake). Bo =\r\nhi and \n&gt; an extended kissaki, male/female mekugi with &quot;mellon&quot; crest. Quit=\r\ne a \n&gt; nice &quot;package&quot; as we say.\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;ve been told some of these were for =\r\nexport, but others were indeed \n&gt; made for presentation during coming-of-ag=\r\ne. It would seem that \n&gt; somebody would know more detail about these swords=\r\n or perhaps know of \n&gt; an authoritative article on them somewhere.\n&gt;\n&gt; Ron\n=\r\n&gt; STL\n&gt;\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n\n\n[No=\r\nn-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
