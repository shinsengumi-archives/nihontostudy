Ita plate tsuba with extensive sukashi work are usually attributed to Katchushi, and that&#39;s why I placed the guard on that page.  The iron is more like Owari than any of the above, though.  It&#39;s a strange combination, but each &quot;component&quot; is consistent with ca. late Muromachi.\n\nYour guard has a wider seppa dai, wider kozuka ana, thicker sukashi walls and a thicker plate.  It has a lot of rust and pitting that make it hard to see the surface but the unrusted areas look very flat and sharp.  Nothing about it points to an early origin, despite using the same design.  Without seeing it in person it&#39;s hard to say if it is a modern repro that has been intentionally rusted or an Edo period guard in poor condition.  I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if it&#39;s modern.  Thanks for posting your tsuba and thanks for the great responses.\n\nJim\n\n\n\n  Hi all,\n  This post is mainly directed to Mr Gilbert but I thought that maybe if \n  someone else would like to comment that would be great.\n  I was browsing your lovely tsuba site and have a question regarding the \n  last tsuba on page two of the Early Iron tsuba link.\n  http://home.earthlink.net/%7Ejggilbert/oldiron2.htm\n  You are writing that it&#39;s an unusual guard, does this mean its hard to \n  kantei? How confident are you about it being a late Muromachi tsuba? \n  Have you or someone else seen this type of tsuba before, maybe in books \n  as for reference?\n  The thing is that I have a very similar tsuba, almost identical, and i \n  would like to have as much information about it as possible. Do you \n  think it may be from the same era as yours or would mine be a later copy?\n  The measurements on my tsuba are almost the same as yours, mine is \n  slightly thicker.\n  8.0 cm H x 8.0 cm W x 0.4 cm T\n\n  Please take a look at it on\n  http://hem.bredband.net/odrike/Tsuba1.htm\n\n  Regards\n  Fredrik\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
