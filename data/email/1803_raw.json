Hoyle&quot; &lt;matthewhoyle@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Sunday, April 04, 2004 8:03 AM\nSubject: [nihontostudy] Shakudo Short Sword Hilts?\n\n\n\nGang, although not entirely Japanese Sword Related, I still thought it\nmight be interesting to bring this up. It seems that tsuba makers also\nmade shakudo hilts for Rapiers and Short Swords for the Dutch in the\nearly 18th cent. I have included an excerpt below from the book I am\nreading at the moment:\n\n[On the topic of Short Swords]\n\n&#39;The Dutch also traded with Japan and as a result a variety of wares\nmade by Japanese craftsmen were carried back to the West. These included\nhilts makde of shakudo, a mixture of copper and gold, and patinated to a\nrich blue colour to contrast with the gilded panels of relief\ndecorations set at intervals on the guard, knucklebow and pommel. As\nwith the ivory hilts from Ceylon, contemporary Dutch hilts were the\nprototypes for these exotic pieces. The craftsmen who made them were\nspecialists in tsuba, Japanese sword guards, and came from the area\naround Nagasaki. The majority of these exotic hilts echo standard\nsmallsword or hunting sword hilts of the 1700&#39;s but hilt forms of the\n1750&#39;s were also copied.&#39;\n\nThe author then goes on to illustrate such a Japanese shakudo hilt. It\nactually kind of looks a tiny bit like Mino work. Very remarkable. Now\nhas anyone ever seen any of these items first hand? Is this phenomenon\ndocumented? Do we know which tsuba makers got involved in this new\nbusiness?\n\nAnd since the Dutch were ordering them back in the 18th cent, I might\nwant to keep my eyes peeled other here, to see if any turn up at auction\nor a local antiquefair (I am in The Netherlands). I would be so lucky\nhahahahaha..\n\nRegards, Matthew\n\n\n\n    Z Recruiting Services\n    �Zurich Toren� Muzenstraat 89\n    2511 WB Den Haag\n    T: +31 70 4262273\n    F: +31 70 4262111\n    W: zrecruiting.com\n    E: info@...\n    Kijk ook op monsterboard.nl, jobbingmall.nl en\n    nationalevacaturebank.nl voor actuele vacatures!\n\n---\nOutgoing mail is certified Virus Free.\nChecked by AVG anti-virus system (http://www.grisoft.com).\nVersion: 6.0.648 / Virus Database: 415 - Release Date: 31-3-2004\n\n\n\n\n\nYahoo!
