Evidence exists in Japan of the extensive use of both \nthe &#39;clos=\r\ned form&#39; and the &#39;lost form&#39; methods of casting - the former \nbeing known i=\r\nn China as early as the Zhou dynasty (1122-249 BC) and the \nlatter being in=\r\ntroduced there &#39;relatively late&#39;. \n\nMany Japanese artefacts could only have=\r\n been produced by the use of \nthis tecnique, and kagami are but one example=\r\n of this. The detail of \nmany cast objects, especially in bronze, could not=\r\n have been acheived \nany other way.\n\nThus my belif in the casting of Namban=\r\n tsuba presumes the use of \na &#39;lost form&#39; method.  The naked-eye evidence o=\r\nf casting; the knowledge \nthat this form as casting was widely known in Jap=\r\nan; and the acceptance \nthat no other contemporanerous method of casting co=\r\nuld have produced \nthese artefacts seem to support this presumption. \n\nI wo=\r\nuld be interested to hear your further comments.\n\nRegards, John L.\n\n--- In =\r\nnihontostudy@yahoogroups.com, &quot;nihontochicken&quot; &lt;rick@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In=\r\n nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Dr John P Lissenden&quot;\n&gt; &lt;docliss@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; I am personally convinced that the vast majority of Namban\n&gt; &gt; tsuba are =\r\ncast and the poor quality of many of these makes this very\n&gt; &gt; easy to dete=\r\nct with the use, simply, of a bright light and x30\n&gt; &gt; magnification. \n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n While the &quot;straight through&quot; pierced tsuba may have been made via a\n&gt; two =\r\npiece mold, the 3-D &quot;crossover vine&quot; type Namban tsuba, if cast,\n&gt; could on=\r\nly have been done so by a lost wax or similar method, not by a\n&gt; &quot;take apar=\r\nt&quot; mold.  Is there evidence that the Japanese used something\n&gt; like the los=\r\nt wax method for casting Namban tsuba?\n&gt; \n&gt; NC\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"
