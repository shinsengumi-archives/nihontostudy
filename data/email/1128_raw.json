I think that your idea is really good, though.  Anyone who can point new eBay bidders toward the lists and clubs will probably do more good than us 40 year old types sitting around as moderators and presidents.  Everyone go to it!  Bottom up efforts are usually better than the top down ones anyhow.  I&#39;m going to start trying it.\n\nCollecting as a sickness -- read Werner Muensterberger&#39;s &quot;Collecting, an Unruly Passion&quot; some time.  It&#39;s right on.\n\nJim\n\n\n\n  One way to start recruiting people that are obviously into the hobby is to \n  e-mail new user IDs on ebay that are bidding on swords and fittings.  I&#39;ve had a \n  few contact me about auctions, etc., and I always refer them to the lists for \n  more information.  I&#39;m not sure if any of them ever join but it is worth the \n  shot.\n  The real problem of this hobby is the expense.  You have to have a good \n  income and a good deal of time to learn.  Most young people don&#39;t have the money or \n  care to spend the time to learn (and I&#39;m not some old man bashing young \n  people, I&#39;m only 26).  Collecting is a sickness, and while many people are infected \n  only a limited number enjoy Japanese swords and fittings, etc.  Ebay is a \n  world wide community and there are people buying swords and tsuba everyday.  I&#39;m \n  sure that 20% don&#39;t even know about this list (my guess comes from no data \n  what so ever).  I think there is potential to recruit from the ranks of ebay.  My \n  2 cents.\n\n  Lou\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
