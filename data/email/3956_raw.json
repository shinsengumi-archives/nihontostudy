Just like in\nswords, making your own steel stopped.  You may have\nheard of &quot;factory plate&quot;.  Basically, you could buy\nthe steel to make the tsuba, and many schools/artists\ngot away from the plate and focused more on the\ndecoration.  From my reading, the truly outstanding\nsmiths were able to do both: have a great plate while\nhaving a superb design.  As a student of tsuba you\nneed to concentrate on the plate and not get\nsidetracked by fancy stuff (poorly paraphrazing some\nsensei)\nKen\n\n--- klepet33319 &lt;Ppeterdds@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; OK -- now this is heresy, blasphemy, and possibly a\n&gt; bit of idolitry \n&gt; throwm in for good measure.  Is it possible that the\n&gt; tekotsu we see in \n&gt; the early guards is from their being made from\n&gt; scraps of steel left \n&gt; over from swordmaking or other purposes and the\n&gt; admixture of different \n&gt; pieces led to the inclussions of differing densities\n&gt; and furthermore \n&gt; that the relative unimportance of the guard to the\n&gt; sword made the bumps \n&gt; around the ede a moot issue?  It seems that later on\n&gt; when the \n&gt; craftsmanship went up the tekotsu went away.  Oh\n&gt; boy, I&#39;m going to get \n&gt; it from this one!\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?  Yahoo!
