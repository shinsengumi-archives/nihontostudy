A lot of these tsuba are fairly small, so the seppa dai will look comparatively large.  Of course if Rich tells us it&#39;s 8 cm in diameter, then I agree that there is something strange.  Based on what I can see in the photo it looks like a legitimate Edo period piece.\nJim\n\n\n\n  Jim & Rich,\n\n  By coincedence I was reading up on the Bushu schools\n  this morning as I tried to confirm a mei on a Bushu\n  tsuba smith. I&#39;m not having much luck, so may beg\n  Jim&#39;s help later.\n\n  I looked at your tsuba and thought Bushu Ito. I wanted\n  to see if I could find similar example in some of the\n  books I had out. It has some of that richness of 3-D\n  carving(?) that always makes me wonder &#39;Umetada&#39;.\n\n  But this one looks so clean and the metal so dark &\n  smooth with no gold loss, and a large seppa dai. No\n  chance its modern or at least post-Edo? Very clean\n  piece.\n     \n  Curran\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
