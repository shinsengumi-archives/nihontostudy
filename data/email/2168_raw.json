When I first saw it back in 1976, I was reluctant to read it, thinking it was simply Paul&#39;s neverending ramblings on. Once I got into it, I was captivated by his observations and thinking with regards to swords as art, and understanding what makes them considered fine art (and why we collect them). Years later, I talked to Paul about this article being reprinted in the JSS/US Newsletter, but he wanted to rewrite it first. As things go, the rewrite never happened. I highly recommend reading this lengthy article, especially the newcomers into this strange field of study we have chosen. If memory serves, Yamanaka called Paul, his &quot;best student&quot; back in those early days. \n\nAs to the importance of understanding jitetsu, a wonderful late-night (in the bar) conversation with one of our well-known German collectors drove home the importance this key &quot;point&quot; of kantei. He said initially, he thought he knew everything about the sword, but when taken under the wing of a true authority in Japan (I forget who), and was shown how to look at the jitetsu and then go on from there, that he realized he knew little to nothing up to that point. It was a great conversation and a great lesson in how to approach kantei. \n\nRon\nSTL\n\n\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: David Zincavage \n  To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com ; token_kenkyu_kai@... ; mastersword53777@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Tuesday, September 21, 2004 1:00 PM\n  Subject: Re: [nihontostudy] Jitetsu\n\n\n  Tom, and other correspondents,\n\n  I was reading yesterday an old collection of lectures (TOKEN TAIKAI) given\n  at the NCJSC show in 1976, which I picked up at this year&#39;s SF show. It\n  contained a rather long article by Paul R. Allman, titled  &quot;Visions within\n  Visions: The Nature of Aesthetics and the Japanese Sword as Fine Art.&quot;\n  Mr. Allman advances a long and complicated set of theories about art in\n  general, and the Japanese sword as art in particular which need not detain\n  us, but he also reminiscences a good deal about personal experiences of his\n  own in the study and appreciation of Nihonto.\n\n  Allman writes (p.52):\n\n  &quot;Albert Yamanaka used to stress to me that that the Honami tradition\n  considered the jitetsu as the ultimate &#39;point&#39; in appraisal.  He told me\n  that it was most difficult to learn.  It took many years and was nearly\n  impossible for a Westerner to learn because we did not get access to swords\n  from each school to compare.  But, he added, the actual iron that was used\n  at each place during each era was the one thing that could not be\n  counterfeited.  First, the counterfeiter couldn&#39;t get the same kind of iron,\n  and second, iron changes as it ages, and there is no way to fake the aging.&quot;\n\n  I believe the &quot;point&quot; in question would be the precise color of the iron in\n  the ji.  I was aware that the steel of Koto blades tends to look blue, while\n  Shinto steel is more yellow, but I had not realised that discernable\n  differences in jitetsu between schools generally existed, apart from a few\n  cases.\n\n  I was wondering if (a) anyone in Japan had done colored jitetsu photos, or\n  if (b) there was a substantial textual discussion of jitetsu differences to\n  be found.\n\n  David\n\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: &quot;Tom Helm&quot; &lt;junkmail@...&gt;\n  To: &lt;nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n  Sent: Monday, September 20, 2004 8:57 PM\n  Subject: Re: [nihontostudy] Jitetsu\n\n\n  Yes,\n  The Nihonto Kantei Dokuhon, otherwise known as the Connoisseur&#39;s guide\n  to the Japanese Sword, and many more for that matter...\n  -t\n\n  On Sep 20, 2004, at 4:46 PM, David Zincavage wrote:\n\n  &gt; Has any book ever been published in Japan illustrating specifically\n  &gt; the differing jitetsu of the Gokaden?\n  &gt;\n  &gt;  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n  &gt;\n  &gt;\n  &gt;\n  &gt;\n  &gt; Yahoo!
