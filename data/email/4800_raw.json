It may simply be an imaginative, random pattern, but your pieces sort of look similar...\n\nRegards,\n\nBarry Thomas\n(Australia)\n\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: BECKY WALLACE \n  To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Tuesday, January 02, 2007 1:11 PM\n  Subject: Re: [nihontostudy] Re: Fwd: Can anyone ID this tsuba?\n\n  OK, with your encouragement, I have disassembled my sword, taken pictures and posted them in my folder &quot;Becky&#39;s Sword&quot;. They are the last 5 pictures in the folder. If the sword blade is signed it appears to be with a single character that looks something like a Y. It isn&#39;t very clear and the pictures aren&#39;t very good, but if anyone can tell anything, I&#39;d sure like to know it.\n\n  Thanks,\n\n  Becky\n\n  bungotakadasword &lt;MuramasaIII@...&gt; wrote:\n  --- In nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com, BECKY WALLACE &lt;SNDE92BW@...&gt; wrote:\n  &gt;\n  &gt; Wow, I can&#39;t believe it. The scan you put in my folder. The one \n  top left is identical to mine. Same crickets. And the signature is \n  identical to the one someone posted as a mino. So now I know about the \n  tsuba. So what about the sword? Is the maker of the sword and the \n  tsuba generally completely different people? schools? are they \n  totally disassociated or might there be some swordsmiths that tended to \n  use tsubas from this particular school?\n  &gt; \n  &gt; Becky\n  . \n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
