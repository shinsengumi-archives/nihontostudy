Next month in San \nFran, Sept \n&gt; there is one in the Chicago area, and Feb down in Florida.  Check \nRich&#39;s web \n&gt; site on reputable dealer links to thier websites.\n&gt; Mike\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;From: &quot;alnsash&quot; &lt;alnsash@y...&gt;\n&gt; &gt;Reply-To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt;To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt;Subject: [nihontostudy] newbie\n&gt; &gt;Date: Wed, 21 Jul 2004 04:55:57 -0000\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Hello all!\n&gt; &gt;I am new to collecting, but have been interested ever since I was\n&gt; &gt;little. I have picked up several books (and yes, read them) and \ncame\n&gt; &gt;to the realization that the only way to start expanding my\n&gt; &gt;understanding from this point is to start making some purchases. \nThe\n&gt; &gt;question I pose to all here is this:\n&gt; &gt;Is there any one thing that a new collector should look for above \nall\n&gt; &gt;else when making a buy?\n&gt; &gt;Now, I know this is a very generalized question, but I need to \nstart\n&gt; &gt;somewhere.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Thanks all!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Alex Bivin\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;BTW - Would like to thank Mr. Stein for his excellent website! It \nwas\n&gt; &gt;largely thanks to you that I understand what little I do!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; _________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Overwhelmed by debt?
