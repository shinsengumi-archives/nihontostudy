These =\r\nkanji are out of norm for me. Some of these \nfittings seem \n&gt;   to be late =\r\nEdo generic stuff and not attributable except when the \nmei \n&gt;   indicates =\r\nthe maker. The minefield of tsuba is tough enough with \n&gt;   excellent copie=\r\ns of copies confusing research, like the Aizu \nShoami and \n&gt;   Mito Kinko. =\r\nMajor schools are not too bad but all those small \nmakers \n&gt;   are hard to =\r\npeg.
