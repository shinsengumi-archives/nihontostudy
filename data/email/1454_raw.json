I haven&#39;t seen it on any older Ko-Kinko, etc., but expect that it could have existed.  It&#39;s quite common in the Goto school on gold.  I have seen illustrations of a couple of Goto examples with shakudo backs with this treatment, but it is rather unusual and might not have been original.  You&#39;ll note that when the Goto used shakudo and gold together in the decorative patterns you mention, the gold will be filed and the shakudo will be polished.  \n\nMy guess is that this technique was a way to put a uniform matte finish on the gold so that it wasn&#39;t too showy.  I doubt that it was for friction, since if it was why not treat the shakudo pieces the same way?  Maybe it also helps to make small scratches and dings in the gold surface from wear less obvious.  Other ideas?\n\nLots of machibori (non-Goto) kinko also used this technique on a wide variety of metals, but even there it&#39;s most commonly seen on gold.  I don&#39;t think that it can be used as a definitive kantei point, but it is certainly something to observe and consider.  The machibori groups also used those decorative patterns of gold and other metals.  Of course some late kinko makers also made some fittings of polished gold, and yes, they are showy indeed.\nJim\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Talking about surface finishes, I was wondering about the &#39;cat scratch&#39;\n  finish we often see on the back of kozuka and kogai. What purpose does\n  this serve and when did this practice begin? Is it at all related to\n  &#39;cat scratch habaki&#39; that have that texture not only for the beauty of\n  it, but also because it secures the sword in the saya a tiny bit more?\n  Also we often see this motif in combination with a polished shakudo or\n  other ground, sometimes in the form of two triangles, sometimes simply\n  two rectangles next to each other. Is there any reason for this, a\n  kantei point perhaps?\n\n  - Matt \n\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
