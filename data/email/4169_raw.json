To \n  &gt;   find a stiffer\n  &gt;   &gt;   deer one would have to go to the tundra...\n  &gt;   &gt; \n  &gt;   &gt;   I recall well a tsuba that I found many years ago.  It was a \n  &gt;   small, copper\n  &gt;   &gt;   sanmai awase (if I correctly remember a phrase I haven&#39;t \n  uttered \n  &gt;   for 15 or more\n  &gt;   &gt;   years!) with a touch of silver (tin??) showing stylised \n  &gt;   (stamped?) waves with a\n  &gt;   &gt;   creature on it that I always thought was an &quot;over-endowed \n  &gt;   rabbit&quot;, but Bob\n  &gt;   &gt;   Haynes told me was a fox!!  I wrote to Bob when I saw a \n  similar \n  &gt;   tsuba in one of\n  &gt;   &gt;   his catalogues.  I was amazed when he said this was a very \n  early \n  &gt;   style of tsuba\n  &gt;   &gt;   ca 1300 - 1400.  I had it for years, often looking at it and \n  &gt;   saying &quot;Do I like\n  &gt;   &gt;   it, or do I not??&quot;  Same thing with this deer kinko.  I have \n  &gt;   gazed at Pete\n  &gt;   &gt;   Klein&#39;s image on yahoo (I actually have the Lundren \n  Collection \n  &gt;   book, but it&#39;s\n  &gt;   &gt;   out on loan to a &#39;kinko&#39; mate) for a long time on this \n  sleepless \n  &gt;   night, and I\n  &gt;   &gt;   ask myself the same question all over again.  So David Z, if \n  I \n  &gt;   could ask you a\n  &gt;   &gt;   question, when you say &quot;I don&#39;t collect kinko at all,  but \n  this \n  &gt;   is one of a\n  &gt;   &gt;   small number of cases which, granted a opportunity, would \n  lead me \n  &gt;   to alter my\n  &gt;   &gt;   policy&quot; I have to ask you &quot;WHY??&quot;  Please explain.\n  &gt;   &gt; \n  &gt;   &gt;   If I found this very tsuba I would think it was junk.  I \n  don&#39;t \n  &gt;   have to tell you\n  &gt;   &gt;   why.  Or do I??  The design spilling into the seppadai I have \n  &gt;   only seen on tsuba\n  &gt;   &gt;   I didn&#39;t care for.  The wobbly surface and incredibly bad \n  nanako \n  &gt;   would kill it\n  &gt;   &gt;   for me.  And the stiff deer doesn&#39;t do anything for me at \n  all.  \n  &gt;   However, I would\n  &gt;   &gt;   look at the larger than usual kozuka ana and opine &quot;Hmmm, \n  maybe \n  &gt;   it&#39;s early&quot;.\n  &gt;   &gt;   Back to my question to myself &quot;Do I like it, or do I not&quot;.  \n  If I \n  &gt;   don&#39;t like it,\n  &gt;   &gt;   I don&#39;t collect it, no matter what the aesthetes say.\n  &gt;   &gt; \n  &gt;   &gt;   Now, this puts me into the rustic class, I know, but there is \n  a \n  &gt;   point to this\n  &gt;   &gt;   that is not all derisory or derogatory.  It is this.  It is \n  easy \n  &gt;   to pick\n  &gt;   &gt;   excellent work amongst Edo period tsuba , even in the \n  iron &quot;wabi-\n  &gt;   sabi&quot; class,\n  &gt;   &gt;   but the archaic styles, the transition between (if we might \n  say) \n  &gt;   conceptual\n  &gt;   &gt;   forerunners and the refined later schools is much, much more \n  &gt;   difficult.  Or is\n  &gt;   &gt;   it??  Recall here Milt&#39;s hawk tsuba that lead to the present \n  &gt;   discussion.  And I\n  &gt;   &gt;   can show you a tsuba that a well-educated (tsuba knowledge) \n  mate \n  &gt;   of mine\n  &gt;   &gt;   dismissed as &quot;late, possibly 1920s&quot;.  It is a masterwork of \n  late \n  &gt;   Edo/early Meiji\n  &gt;   &gt;   and belongs to a friend of mine.  If he gives permission I&#39;ll \n  put \n  &gt;   up some images\n  &gt;   &gt;   of it.\n  &gt;   &gt; \n  &gt;   &gt;   So, to bring this to a close, are there any others inhabiting \n  the \n  &gt;   same closet as\n  &gt;   &gt;   I???  I know I&#39;m lacking an ability, an aesthetic if you \n  like, to \n  &gt;   appreciate the\n  &gt;   &gt;   stiff deer kinko in question and it worries me.  It seems \n  without \n  &gt;   thorough study\n  &gt;   &gt;   and training many tsuba in this time frame would indeed be \n  &gt;   considered junk and\n  &gt;   &gt;   sold off, possibly to an ignominious fate.  The other kinko \n  that \n  &gt;   Pete shows in\n  &gt;   &gt;   two images at the same link does &quot;speak to me&quot;.  It is from \n  the \n  &gt;   same time frame\n  &gt;   &gt;   and I find it elegant and refined and would collect it.  I \n  think \n  &gt;   this discussion\n  &gt;   &gt;   parallels the Sue Koto kazuuchimono line of thinking with \n  blades -\n  &gt;   I don&#39;t\n  &gt;   &gt;   collect those either...\n  &gt;   &gt; \n  &gt;   &gt;   Barry Thomas\n  &gt;   &gt;   (Melbourne, Australia)\n  &gt;   &gt; \n  &gt;   &gt;   ----- Original Message -----\n  &gt;   &gt;   From: &quot;klepet33319&quot; &lt;Ppeterdds@&gt;\n  &gt;   &gt;   To: &lt;nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n  &gt;   &gt;   Sent: Monday, April 17, 2006 5:50 AM\n  &gt;   &gt;   Subject: [nihontostudy] Re: in defense of the ugly bird or \n  &gt;   seeking more &quot;\n  &gt;   &gt;   punishment &quot;\n  &gt;   &gt; \n  &gt;   &gt; \n  &gt;   &gt;   Link to scan &#39;deer&#39; tsuba from Lundgren collection:\n  &gt;   &gt; \n  &gt;   &gt;   \n  http://ph.groups.yahoo.com/group/nihontostudy/photos/view/7936?b=3\n  &gt;   &gt; \n  &gt;   &gt; \n  &gt;   &gt;   SPONSORED LINKS Buy fine art  Japanese translation  Japanese \n  &gt;   incense  \n  &gt;   &gt;         Fine art inkjet paper  Fine art printing  Fine art \n  &gt;   appraisal  \n  &gt;   &gt; \n  &gt;   &gt; \n  &gt;   &gt; ----------------------------------------------------------------\n  ----\n  &gt;   ----------\n  &gt;   &gt;   YAHOO!
