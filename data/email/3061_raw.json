Put another way, is it \nreasonable to assume that all kodogu adjudged, for example, as \nTokubetsu Hozon might be of roughly the same quality,irrespective of \nthe maker, or might such an artefact by an artist considered as Meijin \npossibly be superior to one, graded as Tokubetsu Kicho, by a lesser \nartist?\n\nHave I made clear that rather complicated question?\n\nRegards, JPL.\n\n\n\n\n"
