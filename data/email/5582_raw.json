The famous set of Asuka period =\r\nbronze statues of\n  Yakushi nyorai and Gakko and Nikko at Yakushi-ji in Nar=\r\na have an early\n  example of the grape motif on the base of the Yakushi nyo=\r\nrai statue, so we\n  are talking middle 500s or so. Squirrels may be include=\r\nd in the motif, but I\n  can&#39;t recall right off hand. Thus, there is a defin=\r\nite Buddhist connection.\n  The motif shows up in sword fittings rather earl=\r\ny and I believe there are\n  pieces by Joshin or at least around that time w=\r\nith the motif. Ko-Kinko\n  workers produced it, and there are also some Ko-M=\r\nino examples, if memory\n  serves. As you move into the Edo period, it seems=\r\n to me that the motif was\n  not as popular. Certainly from the mid to late =\r\nEdo period you do not see it\n  very much. If I can remember, I will see wha=\r\nt some of my other sources have\n  to say. I did see your earlier message ab=\r\nout this, but just didn&#39;t jump at\n  it.\n\n  Sorry we will miss you in SF, bu=\r\nt we can catch up at the Daitoken-ishi.\n\n  Gordon\n\n  _____ \n\n  From: nihont=\r\nostudy@yahoogroups.com [mailto:nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com] On\n  Behalf Of=\r\n Ron Hartmann\n  Sent: Thursday, July 09, 2009 10:28 AM\n  To: nihontostudy@y=\r\nahoogroups.com\n  Subject: Re: [nihontostudy] Fw: Sword term meaning...\n\n  T=\r\nhanks for the reply, Gordon.

Thes=\r\ne iny=F4kon posts continued until\n  the late Muromachi period into the Momo=\r\nyama period. They are also seen on\n  generally high class works for the mid=\r\n to late Edo period; however, they no\n  longer went all the way through the=\r\n tsuka and basically worked as the newer\n  chikara-gane do. As noted, stren=\r\ngth and metal is the literal translation,\n  but more accurately I would cal=\r\nl them reinforced/strengthened tabs of\n  typically copper. On an added note=\r\n, at least the first three generations of\n  the main line Goto masters are =\r\nsaid to have only used iny=F4kon posts and\n  menuki without them will typic=\r\nally be attributed to Ko-Goto rather than one\n  of the main guys. I expect =\r\nwe will be catching up with many on the list in\n  San Francisco next month.=\r\n I am certainly looking forward to it.\n\n  Gordon\n\n  _____ \n\n  From: nihonto=\r\nstudy@ &lt;mailto:nihontostudy%40yahoogroups.com&gt; yahoogroups.com\n  [mailto:ni=\r\nhontostudy@ &lt;mailto:nihontostudy%40yahoogroups.com&gt;\n  yahoogroups.com] On\n =\r\n Behalf Of Ron Hartmann\n  Sent: Thursday, July 09, 2009 3:28 AM\n  To: TOKEN=\r\n; nihonto@yahoogroups &lt;mailto:nihonto%40yahoogroups.com&gt; .com;\n  nihontostu=\r\ndy\n  Subject: [nihontostudy] Fw: Sword term meaning...\n\n  Okay, I jumped to=\r\no soon on this question.
