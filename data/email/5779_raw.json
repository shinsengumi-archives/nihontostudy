So how much  sori is too \nmuch?? \n \nI mean it is quite pleasing to the eye, very appealing in fact but it sorta \n looks like a caricature of a sword. \n \nThe sori is tori-sori nice and even the length of the blade, so in keeping  \nwith that I went ahead and curved the nakago to match the sori in the blade \nto  stay with the &quot;lines&quot; of the sword...\n \nIt is in mid polish right now and once I get it mounted I will post some  \npics... I am amazed that the thing held together in the quench as it was \nmoaning  and groaning and dancing around while it was in the tank but I didn&#39;t \nhear one  &quot;Tink&quot;  or &quot;Toink&quot;  and no cracks are coming up and I am at 800 \ngrit  on the polish (I don&#39;t use stones..I am doing this for book IV and am \nusing  available abrasives that just about anyone can get...and I must say I am \ngetting  some really nice results on the blades I am making...)\n \nSo did I make an abomination with 1 1 /2&quot; of sori??? This should cut really \n well with that much curve but I dunno...\n \nThanks all!!\n \nJPH\n \n \nDr JP  Hrisoulas, COL NANG (Ret)\nBladesmith.\nAuthor: The Complete  Bladesmith\nThe Master Bladesmith\nThe Pattern Welded Blade\nhttp: _www.atar.com_ (http://www.atar.com/) \n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
