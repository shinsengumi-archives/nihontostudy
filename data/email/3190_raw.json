As such it is an auspicious symbol.  Perhaps the bamboo is split open  to demonstrate that it is empty (in the positive Taoist/Buddhist sense) at its core, as a samurai opens his belly to disclose his sincerity.  \n\nDavid Zincavage\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: Richard Turner \n  To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Wednesday, July 27, 2005 5:58 PM\n  Subject: Re: [nihontostudy] Pin holes ?????\n\n\n  thanks Jim, so weight&#39;s and split bamboo ??, any particular theme there ?.\n\n  Also, Is Owari close for a kantei ?, I have seen similar examples in \n  some of my books, though of course theme&#39;s were borrowed heavily.  I \n  thought Kyo Shoami was another possibility.\n\n  Many thanks as usual.\n\n  Rich\n\n  Jim Gilbert wrote:\n\n  &gt; Strange Rich.  Normally that sort of  punching was done to spread the \n  &gt; metal out laterally (to shrink the nakago-ana), so nothing would be \n  &gt; broken away or gouged out.  This case is pretty extreme and to no \n  &gt; obvious effect, but still, removing iron isn&#39;t difficult and the holes \n  &gt; wouldn&#39;t be much help as far as I can imagine.  Iron is soft and it \n  &gt; looks like the holes were drilled after the punching.  It strikes me \n  &gt; as some later fiddling to mount it on something, but who knows.\n  &gt;\n  &gt; The design is weights, not axe heads, btw (not your idea, I know).  \n  &gt; The Japanese tool for splitting bamboo looks like a broken off sword \n  &gt; (no kisaki).  A friend of mine from Higashi Hiroshima comes from a \n  &gt; farming family and their bamboo knife is in fact a broken Masahide \n  &gt; sword with a nice mei.\n  &gt;\n  &gt; Jim\n  &gt;\n  &gt;\n  &gt;\n  &gt;   All, in this tsuba ( Owari or Kyo Shoami maybe ?? ) in the punch marks\n  &gt;   on the face, are 3 distinct pin holes or drill holes. Are these to\n  &gt;   enable the metal to be broken away easier when punching out the iron ?.\n  &gt;   Seems reasonable.\n  &gt;\n  &gt;   http://www.l-wise.co.jp/sword/sdata43/egk251-02.jpg\n  &gt;\n  &gt;   http://www.l-wise.co.jp/sword/sdata43/egk251-05.jpg\n  &gt;\n  &gt;   http://www.l-wise.co.jp/sword/sdata43/egk251-04.jpg\n  &gt;\n  &gt;   Any thoughts welcome.\n  &gt;\n  &gt;   Cheers\n  &gt;\n  &gt;   rich\n  &gt;\n  &gt;\n  &gt;\n  &gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n  &gt;\n  &gt;\n  &gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  &gt; YAHOO!
