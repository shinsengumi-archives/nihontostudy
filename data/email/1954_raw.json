I&#39;m a little concerned about your point as well.  I asked about any younger people seriously studying fittings a few years ago and the reply was that they&#39;re only interested in clothes, cars and vacations.  Also, that nobody gets interested in antiques until they&#39;re fifty.  Certainly the people you mention got started younger than that.  Anyone have some more up to date information?\nJim \n\n\n\n  All, as an off topic on this, I was talking with a mate the other day on \n  the sad passing of Fujishiro sensei and how these great men are being \n  replaced. Cary Condell speaks very highly of Fujishiro Matsuo&#39;s son, \n  Fujishiro Okisato and I take him on his word on this matter. It is \n  wonderful to know this organization is in good hands. My friend and I \n  were also talking of other more &quot;singular&quot; giants of nihonto such as \n  Shibata Sensei and who his replacement would be in his business. This \n  led me to Hagihara Sensei, does he have a protege ?, who will replace \n  him when he passes on or retires ?. Is there much in the way of up and \n  coming&#39;s in line after the likes of Shibata, Tanobe and other sensei ?.\n\n  Rich Turner\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
