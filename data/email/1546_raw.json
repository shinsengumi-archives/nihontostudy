The distinctive motifs would place second (or is that third).\nNot all Kanayama guards have wide seppa dai.  Earthlink has told me that\nmy site has already exceeded its bandwidth allotment (it&#39;s happening\nearlier and earlier in the month), but it hasn&#39;t been shut down yet, so\nquickly check:\n\nhttp://home.earthlink.net/~jggilbert/kanayama.htm\n\nSome of them have rather narrow seppa dai.\n\nYou&#39;re following the right process.  \nJim\n\n\n\n  I think that they went out of fashion is indeed a much more plausible\n  explanation....... however it is always fun to think about what might\n  have been. Continuing the subject of Kanayama tsuba, would you say\nthat\n  the &#39;quite large seppa dai in proportion to the rest of the guard&#39;\n  feature on this type of tsuba is a kantei point? For some reason they\n  all seem to have a larger seppa dai in relation to the rest of the\n  design than most other tsuba. \n\n  Other kantei points would be the type of steel, the color, the\ntekkotsu,\n  the designs used (often hard to figure out what they represent) etc. \n\n  Am I missing any here?\n\n  I seem to be getting the knack of distinguishing what is what with all\n  these different tsuba :- / but that is only because I have spent ages\n  and ages looking at all kinds of stuff and remembering what such and\n  such looked like an what school it was. Now I am trying to pinpoint\n  specific features to help attribute guards more correctly and date\nthem.\n  Much like you would do with porcleain with decorative motives and the\n  paste of the porcelain. \n\n  Matt.  \n\n\n\n\n      Z Recruiting Services\n      &quot;Zurich Toren&quot; Muzenstraat 89\n      2511 WB Den Haag\n      T: +31 70 4262273\n      F: +31 70 4262111\n      W: zrecruiting.com\n      E: info@...\n      Kijk ook op monsterboard.nl, jobbingmall.nl en \n      nationalevacaturebank.nl voor actuele vacatures!\n\n\n  -----Oorspronkelijk bericht-----\n  Van: Jim Gilbert [mailto:jggilbert@...] \n  Verzonden: maandag 19 januari 2004 21:37\n  Aan: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com\n  Onderwerp: Re: [nihontostudy] Kanayama tsuba?\n\n\n  Matt,\n  The short answer is that I don&#39;t know.  \n\n  But, I tend to doubt it.  The Norisuke working in the 19th C produced\n  tekkotsu at will and in their copies sometimes exaggerated them beyond\n  what was in the originals.  Good Kanayama work is still more\nattractive,\n  but how much of that is because of raw material vs. technique vs.\n  intent?\n\n  It&#39;s quite possible that Kanayama guards simply went out of style.\nThe\n  aesthetic trend in the Edo period moved away from the tastes of the\n  Muromachi and Momoyama in paintings, ceramics, etc., as well as sword\n  fittings. \n  Jim\n\n\n\n    Gang, how much truth is there to the theory that the Kanayama tsuba\n    makers used a &#39;special secret iron ore known only the them and\n  probably\n    close to where they worked&#39; that produced the wonderful tekkotsu\n  effects\n    in their tsuba? And that when the when they ran out of this\nparticular\n    iron ore the school ceased to exist?\n\n    Matt\n\n\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n    _____  \n\n  Yahoo!
