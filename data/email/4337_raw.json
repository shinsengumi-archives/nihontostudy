I have a book entirely on Norisuke which I&#39;ll take a look at, soon. I&#39;m in the middle of photographing stuff in prep for our stein club meeting which I&#39;m hosting this weekend. )Yes, too many &quot;interests!&quot;) Anyway, I&#39;ll have a look in the book. No english but photos are pretty good. Once owned a mumei tsuba which was probably Norisuke work; Alan Harvie ended up with it. \n\nRon\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: Curran Campbell \n  To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Tuesday, July 11, 2006 10:58 AM\n  Subject: Re: [nihontostudy] Followup on Owari Kinko Tsuba and Norisuke\n\n\n  Alan,\n\n  The tsuba is very thick and rich shakudo. It is very\n  heavy. The gold wire used is also very heavy guage,\n  set extremely deep into channels. It has retained\n  about 99.9% of the inlay, but there is a small spot on\n  the mimi where I can see how deep the channels run and\n  the gold wire extends all the way into it.\n\n  According to Haynes and one or two other sources, the\n  Norisuke line did work in Kinko sometimes.\n\n  I am not saying with 100% certainty that this is a\n  Norisuke, but there is a similar tsuba out there by\n  Norisuke and the more that I look at other tsuba by\n  the Norisuke family, the more I see the same design\n  elements over and over again. Leaf shape. Flower petal\n  engraving. Flower engraving. General composition. Very\n  much like a painting, the great number of details\n  evident in a soft metal heavily carved piece like this\n  seem to me a signature. There is some variation, like\n  there is a very similar 1st gen Norisuke example with\n  near identical leaves, but the main vein of the leaf\n  is done in a single track of gold vs the double vein I\n  have on this leaf.\n  I like to figure things out before I submit them to\n  shinsa, and sometimes if I am happy enough with an\n  answer and intend to keep a piece- I don&#39;t submit to\n  shinsa. I&#39;d be surprised if I actually got a\n  &#39;Norisuke&#39; call on this, but as a newbie-intermediate\n  having something like this seem to click into place\n  has been very satisfying. Yet I may be absolutely\n  wrong! So if I can stand on someone&#39;s shoulder and see\n  further into this.... I welcome the view.\n\n  If you want to take a crack at the other tsuba that\n  has been a challenge for me, I will dig that photo out\n  too and post it. This &#39;Norisuke&#39; has been the more\n  interesting piece and horribly difficult to photograph\n  given the highly reflective shakudo and gold.\n  Photography is not a strong skill for me, yet the\n  devil of a good identification is also in the detail\n  of the other one.\n\n  Curran\n\n  --- Alan Bale &lt;abale@...&gt; wrote:\n\n  &gt; Is the tsuba iron or shakudo?
