These may or may not be real (in the &quot;family&quot; sense) but =\r\n\nI won&#39;t talk\n&gt; about that now.  They are fairly often found and usually re=\r\ngarded \nas a &quot;good\n&gt; sign&quot; of a better class blade in the mounting.  Yours =\r\nis one of the \nso-called\n&gt; Genji mon, I believe, a symbol from history - pe=\r\nrhaps someone knows \nmore about\n&gt; them.  Hawley produced a sheet of all the=\r\n symbols and I&#39;ve probably \nstill got\n&gt; mine around somewhere (40 years of =\r\ndetrtitus hanging around my \nneck!!!)\n&gt; \n&gt; The writing on the wooden part o=\r\nf the tsuka is I believe the \nsignature of the\n&gt; man who made the handle.  =\r\nWhilst unusual such signatures are \nsometimes found.\n&gt; To me they indicate =\r\na custom-made tsuka by an artisan and not a \nregular &quot;factory\n&gt; job&quot;.  Your=\r\n signature has all the appearances of being &quot;enhanced&quot; \nby someone\n&gt; with a=\r\n felt pen, which is a real pity.  Some of these signatures I \nhave found\n&gt; =\r\nare of excellent calligraphy.  I believe there were a few families \nof note=\r\n who\n&gt; were handle binders by profession and were involved in creating \nbet=\r\nter class\n&gt; gunto koshirae.  Your tsuka is one of the best-looking and best=\r\n \ncondition tsuka\n&gt; I have ever seen.  Like new - the silk still has a shee=\r\nn. You are \nfortunate, so\n&gt; help to preserve it by only handling the tsuka =\r\nwith cotton gloves \nto avoid\n&gt; soiling the silk.\n&gt; \n&gt; The scratchy signatur=\r\nes on the metal parts are probably those of \nthe owner and I\n&gt; never pay th=\r\nem any attention as without other documentation it is \nnear\n&gt; impossible to=\r\n find who the owner was..\n&gt; \n&gt; The wooden blade indicates either (a) that a=\r\n former owner polished \nthe blade and\n&gt; put it into shirasaya and had a tsu=\r\nnagi (wooden blade) made for the \nkoshirae.  I\n&gt; have done this for a Tadah=\r\niro II katana I had polished.  Or (b) \nthat a previous\n&gt; owner made his own=\r\n tsunagi and simply sold off the blade...\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; \n&gt; Barry Tho=\r\nmas\n&gt; (Melbourne, Australia)\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ----- Original Message -----\n&gt; From: &quot;=\r\nPatrik Danielsson&quot; &lt;patrik.danielsson@e...&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;nihontostudy@yahoogroups=\r\n.com&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Saturday, January 28, 2006 11:25 PM\n&gt; Subject: [nihontostudy]=\r\n Q:About Gunto mounting whith &quot;signs&quot; on all \nof the\n&gt; parts.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Hello=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; (Not a &quot;real&quot; nihonto quest , but i try anyway.)\n&gt; \n&gt; I bought this p=\r\nieces from a guy that bought this at EBAY for a \ncouple of years\n&gt; ago, he =\r\npaid alot for it, he didnt notice that it had a &quot;wooden&quot; \nblade in\n&gt; it....=\r\n..he thought that it was a complete sword....but anyway i \nbought it from\n&gt;=\r\n him for a couple of $ now.\n&gt; \n&gt; My question is, what are the &quot;marking&quot; on =\r\nthe top of the Tsuka?? \nand all of the\n&gt; parts has the same &quot;sign&quot; on them,=\r\n can someone translate them?, and \nWHY are they\n&gt; sign??? On my other Gunto=\r\n mountings there is no signs on any of the \nkosihrae\n&gt; parts.\n&gt; \n&gt; (i tried=\r\n to fill in the signs on one of the photos)\n&gt; \n&gt; http://photobucket.com/alb=\r\nums/b196/swedeman/mounting/\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Best Regards\n&gt; \n&gt; Patrik\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n"
