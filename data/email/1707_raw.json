But I&#39;ll try and further discussion on it.\nThose with more knowledge ___PLEASE___correct me.\n\nVery -off the cuff- impression is it was later Shinto\nor Shinshinto shortened to fit WW II mounts. Little\nguess as to school. I have much to learn about\nShinShinto.\n  I don&#39;t know much either about WWII mounts, so not\nsure how much that would trim. Would move the machi up\nconsiderably and leave a bright nakago mune behind?\nDoes seem to my eye to have tobiyaki, so I thought\nthat was a good sign.\n   I wondered about the geometry on the kissaki and\nwould like to see the sugata/shape of the whole sword.\n\n\nCurran\n\n--- Robert Gilmore &lt;rgilmore82@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Does anyone have any comments on Verne&#39;s sword? \n&gt; Admittedly it is \n&gt; difficult to see the hamon in his photos, but he is\n&gt; describing \n&gt; Tobiyaki.  Also, it is interesting to see how the\n&gt; nakago mune is shiny \n&gt; near the machi.  I haven&#39;t seen this before.  Would\n&gt; this indicate a \n&gt; recent  machi repair, or a tight habaki that is\n&gt; burnishing the nakago?\n&gt; \n&gt; Bob\n&gt; Verne wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;Hello for Florida, Just joined and am fairly new to\n&gt; japanese sword \n&gt; &gt;collecting. I have created an album under Verne and\n&gt; they are pics of \n&gt; &gt;a sword I just found at an antique shop.Would like\n&gt; some opinons, not \n&gt; &gt;signed. Could be a shorted katana bordering on\n&gt; wakasashi length. The \n&gt; &gt;sword had just been brought in by a WW2 vet&#39;s widow\n&gt; of which he will \n&gt; &gt;give me her name to verify the story.I need help on\n&gt; identifying the \n&gt; &gt;hamo, it is active and on both side there are a\n&gt; couple of pea shaped \n&gt; &gt;temper spots floating over the main temper.\n&gt; &gt;Thanks\n&gt; &gt;Verne\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; -- \n&gt; Robert J.
