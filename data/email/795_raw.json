Usually it is more a matter of lacking attributes that would normally be found on earlier mainline Akasaka or Higo piece.  With Akasaka or Higo guards of the same period there is very little if any difference between the best Tosa Myochin work and the originals.  Even with lesser work, there are pieces that are a toss up between later followers of the original groups or the lesser Tosa Myochin.  \n\nIn general it can be very difficult to determine the maker of unsigned mid to lower level work in the mid to late Edo periods.  People could and did make whatever the customer wanted.  Sometimes you&#39;ll run across the signature of a maker that would not have even made your best guess list if the piece was mumei.  \n\nI&#39;ll have to take a closer look at the signed Tosa Myochin pieces in the future to see if I can pick up any clues.\n\nJim\n\n\n\n  Rich,\n\n  Very nice tsuba. I would have thought later generation\n  Akasaka or side branch Akasaka if it weren&#39;t signed.\n  Circa 1750 to 1800.\n\n  Yet just saw Jim&#39;s answer of c. 1800.\n     Jim- anything other than the signature to\n  distiquish these? Anything about the iron that might\n  be a clue?\n\n  Good looking tsuba.\n\n  Curran\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
