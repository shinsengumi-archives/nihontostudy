As a newbie \nin tsuba study and collecting, it would be SO helpful to actually \nSEE pictures of such primping (wax, lacquer, etc...), as well as to \nsee some before and after pictures of tsuba with rust issues \nand then &quot;post- rust issues&quot;...  If a folder could be opened in the \n&quot;photos&quot; section of the group here, I think it would be really \nbeneficial, especially to rookies like me!  Just a thought...\n\nSteve\n\n\n"
