In those cases my sellers have \ndone all that with no=\r\n extra charge. Of course they are already \nmaking a nice profit and why gil=\r\nd a goose. Most sellers seem to bend \nover backwards to accommodate repeat =\r\ntrade.

I had made a suggestion that\n&gt; the JSS/US=\r\n could make a deal with one of these\n&gt; services for cheaper rates/caps for =\r\nthe membership.  I\n&gt; assume that won&#39;t happen though.\n&gt; \n&gt; Rates are simila=\r\nr some 10%, 12%, some have\n&gt; protection, some only charge 500 yen for shipp=\r\ning (or\n&gt; actual cost if higher), each is a little different so\n&gt; you have =\r\nto look at them all and how they operate to\n&gt; truly compare.  The 8% seems =\r\nto be the lowest.\n&gt; \n&gt; You also have to understand that banks in japan char=\r\nge\n&gt; high fees and don&#39;t have free checking like in the US.\n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; I agre=\r\ne expensive at times, but likely cheaper than\n&gt; getting it here in the US a=\r\nnd/or no availability here\n&gt; in the US.\n&gt; \n&gt; Ken aka Mantis dude\n&gt; \n&gt; --- M=\r\nuramasaIII@... wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; I think checking items &quot; through &quot; their site =\r\nyou\n&gt; &gt; get free  \n&gt; &gt; translation..........at least that&#39;s what I get with=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; that girlie photo  auction.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Milt\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; [Non-text por=\r\ntions of this message have been\n&gt; &gt; removed]\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ____________=\r\n______________________________________\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?\n&gt; Tired of spam?
