I am strongly starting to \n  think it could be Higo Nishigaki, Jim G, you said to have a good look as \n  it may well be something else ( other than Akasaka ) and I did. I knew \n  right off it didn&#39;t have the normal Akasaka mimi, and the edges are just \n  a little soft for the usual seen in akasaka, and it is probably just a \n  bit too thin in the mimi but that does not automatically rule it out, \n  the depth of the tsuba is also thin for Akasaka but again.......\n\n  I think if not Akasaka then Higo is a good call ????? and maybe in \n  particular, Higo Nishigaki.\n\n  Thought&#39;s, right or wrong ?????\n\n  Rich\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
