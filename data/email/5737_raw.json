Apps such as Photoshop \n  excel at this and also XnView which is free is a very good option. I \n  work in Film and Television so this is something I am quite experienced \n  in (as is Jim G our fearless leader)\n\n  I think there would be a good interest in the US and a lesser \n  international interest though selling any form of book to the younger \n  generation seems a daunting task. What do they need books for, they have \n  the internet.\n\n  Rich\n\n  On 13/09/2010 8:13 AM, Dean wrote:\n  &gt;\n  &gt; Richard,\n  &gt;\n  &gt; I presume you are suggesting downgrading the jpg photos to smaller \n  &gt; sizes. I can do that; however, it does reduce the quality of detail. \n  &gt; Do you not have highspeed internet?\n  &gt;\n  &gt; I am thinking about reproducing the catalog, complete with Dad&#39;s notes \n  &gt; and adding pages of the show pictures. Do you think there is a market \n  &gt; for a paper copy (~$40)?\n  &gt;\n  &gt; Dean\n  &gt;\n  &gt; --- In nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n  &gt; &lt;mailto:nihontostudy%40yahoogroups.com&gt;, Richard Turner &lt;ikkanshi@...&gt; \n  &gt; wrote:\n  &gt; &gt;\n  &gt; &gt;\n  &gt; &gt; Hi Dean, yes I agree, it&#39;s a brilliant job. One thing I would \n  &gt; suggest is\n  &gt; &gt; getting a little smarter with your photos as the page takes a long time\n  &gt; &gt; to load. I down loaded one photo and it is 2.3 meg. Given that there \n  &gt; are\n  &gt; &gt; many images there it will slow down the loading considerably and also\n  &gt; &gt; eat into peoples bandwith depending on their connection speeds.\n  &gt; &gt;\n  &gt; &gt; There are some easy ways to alleviate this and if you would like to\n  &gt; &gt; discuss them please just let me know. I would be happy to help you.\n  &gt; &gt;\n  &gt; &gt; Cheers\n  &gt; &gt;\n  &gt; &gt; Richard Turner\n  &gt; &gt;\n  &gt; &gt;\n  &gt; &gt; On 13/09/2010 3:20 AM, lorrez_d wrote:\n  &gt; &gt; &gt;\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; Amazing work you&#39;re doing there !
