Attached is the itinerary for the upcoming tour from October=\r\n 16th to \nOctober 27th.  It is only 5 months from now so now is a good time=\r\n to do some \nadvance planning. All things considered, the cost of the trip =\r\nis a modest \ninvestment as you will learn, see and experience so much. If y=\r\nou confine \nyourselves to sword shows and museums in the USA, you will NEVE=\r\nR advance \nyour knowledge. I organize and conduct the one and only comprehe=\r\nnsive and \nfocused Japanese swords, fittings and weaponry tour.\nThanks for =\r\nreading,\n\nFred\nSwordSmith Secrets\nEmail: swordsmithsecret@...\n\n____=\r\n_____________________________________________________________\nMore photos, =\r\nmore messages, more storage=97get 2GB with Windows Live Hotmail. \nhttp://im=\r\nagine-windowslive.com/hotmail/?locale=3Den-us&ocid=3DTXT_TAGHM_migration_HM=\r\n_mini_2G_0507\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
