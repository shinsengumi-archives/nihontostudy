Also, please forgive my typos made in haste while  \n&gt; trying save a truly historic dojo, they are being addressed.\n&gt;\n&gt; It is time to fight the man again. Multi million dollar Kodansha  \n&gt; publishing company want to tear down Noma dojo (Tokyo) as it does  \n&gt; not suit them to have a historically important dojo on their  \n&gt; grounds. Before the war, Noma dojo was one of the four great dojo  \n&gt; of the eastern capital. Now it is the only remaining one. It was  \n&gt; the site of the last kendo competition that was attended by the  \n&gt; Emperor, and the dojo of the most famous sensei of the 20th century  \n&gt; Mochida Moriji sensei.\n&gt;\n&gt; Please support our opposition to tearing down such a wonderful dojo  \n&gt; and memorable experience for visiting kendoka. Here is a link for  \n&gt; our petition to save Noma dojo.\n&gt;\n&gt; http://www.petitiononline.com/savenoma/petition.html\n&gt;\n&gt; Best\n&gt;\n&gt; Paul\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"
