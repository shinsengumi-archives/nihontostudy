Each section of gunome is seperated with a slightly larger ashi,\n    which while subtle, does make the straight gunmome hamon appear in\n  &quot;groups&quot;\n    of gunome. Hope that is clear.\n\n    One term I find is called &quot;sugu ashi iri&quot; which I take to mean, &quot;suguha\n    containing ashi.&quot; \n\n    The pattern I&#39;m trying to describe would see (to me) correctly described\n  as\n    something like &quot;sugu kaku (boxed) gunome ashi iri&quot; or am I sounding too\n    midwestern with my Japanese??  Any comments?  If a small sketch (file)\n  would\n    help, I&#39;ll send one out.\n\n    Ron\n    STL\n\n    [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Yahoo!
