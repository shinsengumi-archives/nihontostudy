I&#39;m sure that there is further commentary in Joly=\r\n&#39;s translations of Akiyama republished in the NCJSC newsletters some years =\r\nago, but I don&#39;t have them organized or indexed.\n\nNobuie Tsuba by Nakamura =\r\nis as good a picture sources as any, at least for having large numbers of e=\r\nxamples to compare.  Each mei is attributed to a type in the text of the os=\r\nhigata section.  The attribution is usually at or near the end of the text =\r\n(lower left portion).  \n=E6=94=BE=E3=82=8C=E9=8A=98 hanare-mei, =E5=A4=AA=\r\n=E5=AD=97=E9=8A=98 futoji- mei, =E8=A9=B0=E3=82=8A=E9=8A=98 sumari-mei, =E5=\r\n=B7=A6=E5=82=BE=E9=8A=98 sakei-mei and =E7=94=B2=E8=83=83=E9=8A=98 katchu-m=\r\nei are ones I saw frequently when I flipped through the book.  \n\nIn the pas=\r\nt there were something like 8 or more categories of mei in use.  Most signa=\r\ntures these days are lumped into futoji-mei and hanare-mei.  There&#39;s quite =\r\na bit of variability among accepted examples in each category though, so th=\r\nings are still not simple.  Wakayama shows some details about the different=\r\n signatures in the first volume of his Toso Kodogu Koza.  No doubt there ar=\r\ne other comparisons in the various survey books.\n\nIt&#39;s a difficult area.\n\nJ=\r\nim\n\n\n\n  Would anyone know of a source for explaination/differentiation of t=\r\nhe \n  different mei for Nobuiye?  Akiyama apparently published this but I&#39;v=\r\ne \n  never been able to find the reference in English.\n  Thanks much!\n  Pet=\r\ne\n\n  PS:  Good to see you back Jim!!!\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message=\r\n have been removed]\n\n\n"
