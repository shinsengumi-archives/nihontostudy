The cha=\r\nracter that looked like a Y now looks like a Y with a &quot;n&quot; attached to the b=\r\nottom right side.  I tried to draw it in Power Point - I think I captured t=\r\nhe gist of it, but the arms of the Y aren&#39;t crooked like my left side is.  =\r\nI think I&#39;ve seen this character before.  Later if I have time, I&#39;ll try an=\r\nd scan the rubbing so you can see what I actually see, but for now I have t=\r\no run.\n   \n  Becky\n\nCurran Campbell &lt;neobliviscar@...&gt; wrote:\n       =\r\n   Becky,\n\nHappy New Year!\nI&#39;d agree with John, Barry, and Rich.
