One difference is that submissions for koshirae shinsa, including\ntsuka-only submissions, will have the signatures of the kodogu elements\nnoted where visible, but will not get attributions of maker or time period\nfor any unsigned kodogu elements.  \n\nSo, Milt&#39;s tsuka, if genuine, would be described in detail as to materials,\ncarving and inlay techniques, decorative motifs, and be measured and\nphotographed, but would not receive maker attributions for the menuki or\nfuchigashira.  A date and point value for the koshirae as a unit will be\nprovided, but not for the individual kodogu elements.  \n\nAgreed that a tsuba and tsuka without a saya is not an appropriate\nsubmission for koshirae shinsa.\n\nA customer can submit a complete koshirae for shinsa and then, for example,\nsubmit the mumei tsuba separately as kodogu if an attribution of maker, time\nperiod and point value is desired.  This requires two submissions, though.\n\nAn advantage of overseas shinsa is that we can immediately contact the owner\nof the item if there is a problem with the submission.  For example, if a\ntsuka is submitted for koshirae shinsa and the fuchigashira are genuine but\nthe menuki are reproductions, we will track down the owner and advise him\nthat the item will fail as koshirae due to the menuki, but that if he would\nlike to change the submission (no additional charge) to kodogu shinsa of the\nfuchigashira, it can be certified.  We &quot;saved&quot; a nice Omori Teruhide F/K\nthis way.\n\nJim  \n\n\n\n\n\n  Milt,\n  I cannot speak for the NTHK.\n  Jim will be able to answer the shinsa criteria for fittings.\n\n  My experience with the NBTHK is:\n  You can submit the entire tsuka.\n  If any element is false (gimei FK, cast menuki)it will not pass.\n  If all is proper it will paper as &quot;Tsuka mae&quot;.\n  The mei of the FK will be noted.\n  If there is no mei it will likely be attributed.\n\n  The tsuba will require a separate submission.\n\n  Twofer&#39;s include Daisho Tsuba, Daisho FKs, or Menuki,\n  Futokoro or Mitokoromono, and of course Daisho koshirae.\n\n  Cary Condell\n\n  Condell & Co., Ltd.\n  P.O.
