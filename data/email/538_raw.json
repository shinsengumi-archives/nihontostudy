Today, I would only submit a tsuba to shinsa if the \n&gt; signature was important enough to make the tsuba &quot;valuable&quot; enough to justify the \n&gt; costs. One tsuba here that I&#39;m considering sending to shinsa is mumei but if \n&gt; judged &quot;Akasaka&quot; and perhaps designated to a particular generation, in my \n&gt; eyes, it would justify the cost of shinsa. Bob Benson mentioned awhile back that \n&gt; a lot of people are acquiring only Hozon papers and not bothering with paying \n&gt; for Tokubetsu shinsa, simply to &quot;confirm&quot; the mei. \n&gt; \n&gt; Personally, I am an advocate of papers being gotten on &quot;priority&quot; items in \n&gt; my collection. \n&gt; \n&gt; Ron\n&gt; STL\n&gt; \n\ngang,\nan alternative to sending to NBTHK shinsa ( postage/insurance, agent&#39;s fee, \nshinsa fee etc could run to 400 just for hozon paper) is to wait for the NTHK \nshinsa in LA 2004.\n\nMilt\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
