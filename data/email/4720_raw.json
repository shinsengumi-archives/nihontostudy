If I do put the hi on it will not be for \nwhistling purposes. What makes people think that I would shallowly ruin \nan old blade. I see no reason why the blade cannot be used for Iaido and \nadding a hi on it does not ruin the blade, if done by a proper smith in \nJapan. The blade can still be appreciated. We are obviously looking at \nthis from opposite ends. If done correctly and I presented you with the \nblade for the first time you would probably not know that it was modified.\nEnore\n\nexcelsiorilluminati wrote:\n&gt; Hello Enore, To place bohi to lighten an old sword means the sword is \n&gt; too heavy for you. It was done often with conversion of tachi to \n&gt; uchigatana or katana, to balance the sword. Hearing about the koto \n&gt; being carved makes me shudder. To carve bohi for better whistling \n&gt; sounds is a shallow reason to alter something that can not be undone. \n&gt; You will never use this sword for what it was intended (battle) so \n&gt; use an iaito with any horimono you wish to make whistles and leave \n&gt; historical irreplaceable objects alone.

Don&#39;t \n&gt;&gt;     \n&gt; forget \n&gt;   \n&gt;&gt; though, a sword is made for a reason and I don&#39;t believe its for \n&gt;&gt; appreciation of its beauty. First and foremost it was made to be \n&gt;&gt;     \n&gt; used. I \n&gt;   \n&gt;&gt; see nothing wrong with practicing with it. I intend to take very \n&gt;&gt;     \n&gt; good \n&gt;   \n&gt;&gt; care of it.......... I consider myself  very lucky to own such a \n&gt;&gt;     \n&gt; piece.\n&gt;   \n&gt;&gt; Enore\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Peter A Bleed wrote:\n&gt;&gt;     \n&gt;&gt;&gt; Enore,\n&gt;&gt;&gt; I want to second Gordon&#39;s advice. I would urge you not to alter \n&gt;&gt;&gt;       \n&gt; your  sword\n&gt;   \n&gt;&gt;&gt; in the way you are describing. If you want a grooved blade order \n&gt;&gt;&gt;       \n&gt; one or\n&gt;   \n&gt;&gt;&gt; find one. At the very least you should not do anything until you \n&gt;&gt;&gt;       \n&gt; have had\n&gt;   \n&gt;&gt;&gt; your blade well shinsa&#39;d.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Still, your question does point up a basic feature of the world of\n&gt;&gt;&gt; nippon-to. The values and standards of the various people \n&gt;&gt;&gt;       \n&gt; involved in\n&gt;   \n&gt;&gt;&gt; Japanese swords are diverse. What is absolutely &quot;wrong&quot; to some \n&gt;&gt;&gt;       \n&gt; is &quot;just\n&gt;   \n&gt;&gt;&gt; fine&quot; to others. Most of us base our actions on our views of \n&gt;&gt;&gt;       \n&gt; aesthetics and\n&gt;   \n&gt;&gt;&gt; a sense of historical preservation. There are other values out \n&gt;&gt;&gt;       \n&gt; there and\n&gt;   \n&gt;&gt;&gt; knowing that helps to understand some of the things we see about \n&gt;&gt;&gt;       \n&gt; swords.\n&gt;   \n&gt;&gt;&gt; When I was first in Japan I happened to meet a number of sword \n&gt;&gt;&gt;       \n&gt; craftsmen\n&gt;   \n&gt;&gt;&gt; rather than collectors. Of course this was interesting (heck, it \n&gt;&gt;&gt;       \n&gt; was\n&gt;   \n&gt;&gt;&gt; wonderful), but it may have given me a skewed view.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; 1. The first &quot;smith&quot; I met ( and he was an important artist-and a\n&gt;&gt;&gt; wonderful person) was re-tempering some old swords when I visited \n&gt;&gt;&gt;       \n&gt; his\n&gt;   \n&gt;&gt;&gt; forge.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; 2.  An important kinko proudly showed me his portfolio that \n&gt;&gt;&gt;       \n&gt; included some\n&gt;   \n&gt;&gt;&gt; very excellent &quot;umegane&quot; work he had done. He assured me that &quot;no \n&gt;&gt;&gt;       \n&gt; one could\n&gt;   \n&gt;&gt;&gt; see&quot; the fillings he had put into some seriously flawed blades.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; 3. During a road trip with a fellow who had recently completed his\n&gt;&gt;&gt; polishing apprenticeship, we took a long extra trip to let his \n&gt;&gt;&gt;       \n&gt; teacher see\n&gt;   \n&gt;&gt;&gt; the grooves he was carving on a tanto. He was proud of his work \n&gt;&gt;&gt;       \n&gt; and his\n&gt;   \n&gt;&gt;&gt; master approved. When I asked why he was doing it, he said &quot;the \n&gt;&gt;&gt;       \n&gt; smith\n&gt;   \n&gt;&gt;&gt; should have put the grooves in.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; These men are not crooks or villains. Indeed, I think they are \n&gt;&gt;&gt;       \n&gt; great\n&gt;   \n&gt;&gt;&gt; artists and skilled students, but they operate with a different \n&gt;&gt;&gt;       \n&gt; set of\n&gt;   \n&gt;&gt;&gt; values.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; You certainly can find craftsmen who will do what you ask of \n&gt;&gt;&gt;       \n&gt; them, but one\n&gt;   \n&gt;&gt;&gt; thing is clear. You will only be able to cut grooves in your \n&gt;&gt;&gt;       \n&gt; sword once. I\n&gt;   \n&gt;&gt;&gt; urge you to proceed with caution.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Peter\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Peter Bleed\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Professor of Anthropology\n&gt;&gt;&gt; 810 Oldfather Hall\n&gt;&gt;&gt; University of Nebraska\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Lincoln, NE 68588-0368\n&gt;&gt;&gt; (402) 472-2439\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;       \n&gt;&gt;                                                                     \n&gt;&gt;     \n&gt;        \n&gt;   \n&gt;&gt;&gt;              &quot;Gordon \n&gt;&gt;&gt;       \n&gt; Robson&quot;                                               \n&gt;   \n&gt;&gt;&gt;              \n&gt;&gt;&gt;       \n&gt; &lt;robsongo@...                                             \n&gt;   \n&gt;&gt;&gt;              \n&gt;&gt;&gt;       \n&gt; jp&gt;                                                        To \n&gt;   \n&gt;&gt;&gt;              Sent by:                  \n&gt;&gt;&gt;       \n&gt; &lt;nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com&gt;      \n&gt;   \n&gt;&gt;&gt;              \n&gt;&gt;&gt;       \n&gt; nihontostudy@yaho                                          cc \n&gt;   \n&gt;&gt;&gt;              \n&gt;&gt;&gt;       \n&gt; ogroups.com                                                   \n&gt;   \n&gt;&gt;                                                                    \n&gt;&gt;     \n&gt; Subject \n&gt;   \n&gt;&gt;&gt;                                        RE: [nihontostudy] Bo-\n&gt;&gt;&gt;       \n&gt; hi            \n&gt;   \n&gt;&gt;&gt;              12/05/2006 \n&gt;&gt;&gt;       \n&gt; 05:16                                              \n&gt;   \n&gt;&gt;&gt;              \n&gt;&gt;&gt;       \n&gt; PM                                                            \n&gt;   \n&gt;&gt;                                                                     \n&gt;&gt;     \n&gt;        \n&gt;   \n&gt;&gt;                                                                     \n&gt;&gt;     \n&gt;        \n&gt;   \n&gt;&gt;&gt;              Please respond \n&gt;&gt;&gt;       \n&gt; to                                             \n&gt;   \n&gt;&gt;&gt;              \n&gt;&gt;&gt;       \n&gt; nihontostudy@yaho                                             \n&gt;   \n&gt;&gt;&gt;                 \n&gt;&gt;&gt;       \n&gt; ogroups.com                                                \n&gt;   \n&gt;&gt;                                                                     \n&gt;&gt;     \n&gt;        \n&gt;   \n&gt;&gt;                                                                     \n&gt;&gt;     \n&gt;        \n&gt;   \n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Hi Enore,\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Are you talking about taking an antique sword and cutting a \n&gt;&gt;&gt;       \n&gt; groove in it? I\n&gt;   \n&gt;&gt;&gt; hope not. There is no one I know of in Japan who would do that. \n&gt;&gt;&gt;       \n&gt; And I think\n&gt;   \n&gt;&gt;&gt; you would be hard pressed to find someone who would even do it to \n&gt;&gt;&gt;       \n&gt; a newly\n&gt;   \n&gt;&gt;&gt; made blade. The sword comes as it is and anything added later is \n&gt;&gt;&gt;       \n&gt; typically\n&gt;   \n&gt;&gt;&gt; not seen as a good thing.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Gordon\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt;&gt;&gt; From: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n&gt;&gt;&gt;       \n&gt; [mailto:nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com] On\n&gt;   \n&gt;&gt;&gt; Behalf Of egardonio\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Sent: Wednesday, December 06, 2006 2:28 AM\n&gt;&gt;&gt; To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Subject: [nihontostudy] Bo-hi\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Hello everybody, I&#39;m new to this forum so if I make an error \n&gt;&gt;&gt;       \n&gt; please\n&gt;   \n&gt;&gt;&gt; remember that.
