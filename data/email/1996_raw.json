I have picked up several books (and yes, read them) and came \nto the realization that the only way to start expanding my \nunderstanding from this point is to start making some purchases. The \nquestion I pose to all here is this:\nIs there any one thing that a new collector should look for above all \nelse when making a buy?\nNow, I know this is a very generalized question, but I need to start \nsomewhere.\n\nThanks all!\n\nAlex Bivin\n\nBTW - Would like to thank Mr. Stein for his excellent website! It was \nlargely thanks to you that I understand what little I do!\n\n\n"
