I got to see one\n&gt; of those Hong Kong Crappers up close and personal. I\n&gt; had a new\n&gt; acquaintance make a 5 hour drive up from the\n&gt; southern part of the state\n&gt; today to meet and greet and share his new sword with\n&gt; me. A young man in\n&gt; his late teens. He was lucky in the sense that he\n&gt; didn&#39;t pay for this\n&gt; sword, it was a gift, but someone bought it for him,\n&gt; mores the pity for\n&gt; them. \n&gt; It was decked out in what appeared to be standard\n&gt; gunto mount&#39;s that\n&gt; turned out to be very poorly made indeed. The blade\n&gt; really isn&#39;t worthy\n&gt; of mention, very poorly acid etched hamon, cheap old\n&gt; iron that had been\n&gt; ground into shape. The mei looked like it was\n&gt; scratched out with a nail\n&gt; or something. It was so badly made I couldn&#39;t\n&gt; believe it. Still, he\n&gt; hangs it on his wall and enjoys it for what it is at\n&gt; the moment. \n&gt; \n&gt; He want&#39;s to come to one of the local auctions later\n&gt; in the year. I\n&gt; didn&#39;t have anything to show him as we met at my\n&gt; office but I said when\n&gt; he sees something that is properly made he will\n&gt; understand more, for now\n&gt; his cheap and nasty HKC can hang on his wall and he\n&gt; can dream of betters\n&gt; things ahead. \n&gt; \n&gt; Maybe with luck, in a few month&#39;s time we will have\n&gt; another convert in\n&gt; our midst. \n&gt; \n&gt; cheers all \n&gt; \n&gt; Rich T\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been\n&gt; removed]\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo!
