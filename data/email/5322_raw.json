If present, that would be a recent addition, probably to try to &quot;improve&quot; the surface of a rusty plate and/or to try to hold loose inlay in place.  I doubt that it&#39;s lacquer - it&#39;s probably something modern.  I&#39;d consider it a serious condition problem.  I have seen that occasionally on Onin tsuba, which do tend to have very dry, rusty plates that are very difficult to restore properly.\n\nAgreed that nikuoki is a different term when used around swords.\n\nJim  \n\n\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: MuramasaIII@... \n  To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Thursday, February 28, 2008 9:15 PM\n  Subject: Re: [nihontostudy] Nikuoki\n\n\n  what&#39;s Asahi ?
