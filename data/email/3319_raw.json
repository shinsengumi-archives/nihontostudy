The reverse is of polished shakudo and, \nunfortunately, the mei is too badly rubbed to be easily identified.  \nIt consists of five characters, the fourth of which may be &#39;taka&#39; and \nthe fifth probably a kao.  The first two kangi are NOT Yanagawa!\n\nI fear that the very unsatisfactory photograph is the best possible, \nconsidering the state of the mei but, given a suggested maker, I may \nbe able to marry that name to what remainss of the kangi.\n\nWith thanks in anticipation, John L.\n\n\n\n"
