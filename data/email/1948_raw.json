I was going to call Coleman and ask (which I might still do) but perhaps the question has already been answered. \n\nRon\nSTL\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: arnold frenzel \n  To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Thursday, June 24, 2004 6:08 PM\n  Subject: [nihontostudy] Inquiry\n\n\n  Hi Jim:\n  Can you confirm that Hagihara sensei will still be doing the kodogu at\n  Chicago? It matters a lot to me in terms of what I bring. Thank you.\n  Arnold afrenzel@...\n\n\n\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; jggilbert@... 06/23/04 5:10 PM &gt;&gt;&gt;\n  Rich,\n  At least it is someone interpreting the Kaneie style.  The motif is a\n  memento mori as you say.  Sometimes that motif is tied to Sekigahara,\n  but seems like it could fit any battle.\n\n  Jim\n\n    wrote:\n    &gt; Just picked up this tsuba off ebay. What school?\n    &gt; Maybe Saga Kaneie? I assume (?) the theme refers\n    &gt; to death in battle, shortness of life, etc. with\n    &gt; dog eating/scattering the bones?\n    &gt; \n    &gt; http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&category=73466&item=\n    &gt; 3730529406&rd=1\n    &gt; \n    &gt; \n    &gt; Rich S\n\n    In case the above link doesn&#39;t work.
