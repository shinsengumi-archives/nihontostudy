You would be better off going to Bugei forum or International \nSword Forum and asking. The members here are true conservationists and \nwhat you are suggest is grating on many nerves. This is not something \nthat is offered in this day and age as a rule, as Mr Robson has noted it \nis not really done by the top togi in Japan. Most Hi are polished out \nover time and eventually almost disappear.\n\nDon&#39;t feel you are being attacked personally. it is just that most true \nNihontophiles consider this a blasphemy of sorts.\n\nCheers\n\nRichard\n\nEnore Gardonio wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Its a Shinto blade not Koto. If I do put the hi on it will not be for\n&gt; whistling purposes. What makes people think that I would shallowly ruin\n&gt; an old blade. I see no reason why the blade cannot be used for Iaido and\n&gt; adding a hi on it does not ruin the blade, if done by a proper smith in\n&gt; Japan. The blade can still be appreciated. We are obviously looking at\n&gt; this from opposite ends. If done correctly and I presented you with the\n&gt; blade for the first time you would probably not know that it was modified.\n&gt; Enore\n&gt;\n&gt; Date: 12/6/2006 4:39 PM\n&gt;   \n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
