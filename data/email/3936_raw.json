Great\nstuff and makes it clearer.  If someone had the time,\nit would be great to put these up on your/someone&#39;s\nwebsite.  All these sites devoted to swords, could use\nsome more to tsuba.  Would love to see tekkotsu\nwebsite depicting various schools.\n\nNow for the next question- why so different?  metal\nused? folding techniques?  when forming the mimi what\nsteps would they do (I know big questions)?\n\nThanks- as always you are extremely helpful.\nKen\n\n--- Jim Gilbert &lt;jggilbert@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; Ken,\n&gt; I photographed some Kanayama tekkotsu and posted\n&gt; them here:\n&gt; \n&gt;\nhttp://ph.groups.yahoo.com/group/nihontostudy/photos/browse/d4b0\n&gt; \n&gt; Hopefully it will make things more rather than less\n&gt; clear.  It&#39;s difficult to capture the whole package\n&gt; in a few photos.\n&gt; \n&gt; JIm\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   Jim,\n&gt; \n&gt;   While I am reading kantei #2 and becoming familiar\n&gt;   with the groups people are talking about, you\n&gt; didn&#39;t\n&gt;   give me a chance to ask a question back on #1.  Is\n&gt; it\n&gt;   possible to get picture of the tekkotsu from\n&gt; kanayama\n&gt;   for comparison?  I am visual, there is a dirty\n&gt; joke in\n&gt;   there, and that would really help sink it into the\n&gt;   brain.\n&gt; \n&gt;   Very interesting all of this.  I have lots of\n&gt; books I\n&gt;   just purchased and several months of reading. \n&gt; Just\n&gt;   have to finish the sword section of the boston\n&gt; museum\n&gt;   and I&#39;m into 4 or 5 tsuba books.  Hopefully, I can\n&gt;   start to get a handle on some of this.  So I\n&gt; wouldn&#39;t\n&gt;   even begin to give an answer.  \n&gt; \n&gt;   Thanks again.\n&gt;   Ken\n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been\n&gt; removed]\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?
