There is some question as to whether or not they were\nfor\nwear with the cutting edge down. I don&#39;t know of any illustrations\nshowing\nright handed wear. I might add that to the best of my knowledge there is\nno\nsuch thing as an entirely left-handed person. Left-handed individuals\neither\ndue to nurture or nature seem to do some things with the right-hand and\nothers with the left and sometimes able to use both for the same thing.\n\n\n\nGordon\n\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: John Lissenden [mailto:docliss@...] \nSent: Tuesday, December 21, 2004 12:10 AM\nTo: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: Re: [nihontostudy] Musashi&#39;s sword\n\n\n\nTo inject a slightly more serious note into the smugness of your\n&#39;leftie&#39;\nmembers ... \n\nDo any members KNOW if left-handedness was extant among early Japanese\nswordsmen.  I have never, personally, seen illustrations of samurai\nwearing\ntheir swords on the right side, and it is not inconceivable that they\nwere\ntrained at an early age to use their swords in the conventional manner. \nThe\nonly advantage in being left handed is, surely, its comparative rarity\nand\nstrangeness to a right-handed opponent.\n\nInterestingly, I have in my collection (WAY 386.27.ex Gardiner\ncollection)\nan unsigned,  shakudo fuchi-gashira, attributed to Hirata Harunari  This\nhas\nan ishime surface, with takaramono in a shippo of coloured enamels\nwithin\ngold cloissons.  The ura surface of the fuchi has had an additional\ntakaramono added in gold lacquer, and this may possibly be to facilitate\nits\nwearing on the right side by presenting a more decorative surface.  I\ncan\nthink of no other possible explanation for this modification.\n\nJohn L.\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYahoo!
