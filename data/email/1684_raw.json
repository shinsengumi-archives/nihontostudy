Now what school and period?\n&gt; With the well hammered, &quot;S&quot; folded plate, deep black patina\n&gt; and dark, rich brass zogan, I tend toward early Shoami\n&gt; or maybe Heianjo. The plate almost looks Saotome in quality.\n\nStrange, replying to your own posts :-)\n\nI was wondering since the plate is katchushi style &quot;S&quot; folded\nand well worked as stated above. The brass zogan is well done\nand as good as the kinko work of Nara or Ko-Nara. Could this\nbe a Nara or Ko-Nara piece on a Saotome plate?? (Probably\ntrying to read to much into it :-)\n\nRich S\n\n\n\n"
