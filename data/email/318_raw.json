Were they made by general leather workers that made all sorts of items, or by people who specialized in arms and armor?  My guess is that they weren&#39;t made by the same people who were making metal sword fittings, armor, etc., given the class issues around hide working.  Has anyone researched the pre-industrial leather trade in Japan?\n\nJim\n\n\n\n  Jim & all,\n\n  I see, perhaps it was just a common technique use on different items.
