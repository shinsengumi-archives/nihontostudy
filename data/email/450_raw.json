Looks like mottled gray paper, the usual ink =\r\ncake for the outline... opaque white pigment (gouache?) for the hamon?  Not=\r\n sure how the hada is drawn in other than by lots of sharp pencil work.  In=\r\nteresting way of representing utsuri and antai.  Reality can be marked on p=\r\naper in many different ways.
