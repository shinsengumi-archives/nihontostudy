Bob Elde\n\n--- Mark Conneran &lt;conneranm@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; For what it&#39;s worth, as a potential &quot;new-bee&quot;, I\n&gt; thought I&#39;d be presumptuous \n&gt; enough to make a few observations regarding the\n&gt; Jersey City show. I came up \n&gt; to the show with a friend, hoping to take in a\n&gt; lecture or two. Obviously a \n&gt; lot of work went into it. A few thoughts, for what\n&gt; it&#39;s worth, as \n&gt; constructive criticism. We went to the taikai and\n&gt; skipped the shinsa \n&gt; thinking that the latter would only be for those\n&gt; submitting swords to be \n&gt; evaluated. The taikai was worthwhile for the budo\n&gt; demonstrations alone. The \n&gt; swords in the sword display, however, were not\n&gt; labeled and we were, of \n&gt; course, curious to know what it was we were viewing.\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; We are both members of JSS/US but haven&#39;t attended\n&gt; any of the NY club \n&gt; meetings and really have little sword knowledge. As\n&gt; such I&#39;m enormously \n&gt; impressed by the knowledge of the members of this\n&gt; list. But from the \n&gt; comments I&#39;ve seen here earlier discussing the need\n&gt; to attract &quot;new blood&quot;, \n&gt; I think activities such as the &quot;introduction to\n&gt; sword handling&quot; lecture \n&gt; might perhaps be expanded and publicized. Again, for\n&gt; what it&#39;s worth.\n&gt; \n&gt; Mark Conneran\n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: Gordon Robson &lt;robsongo@...&gt;\n&gt; To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Date: Thu, 7 Sep 2006 14:46:39 +0900\n&gt; Subject: Re: [nihontostudy] Re: Jersey City sword\n&gt; show...\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; It would be funny, if it were not so sad. This list\n&gt; and a shinsa  \n&gt; should be a serious opportunity for learning. I hope\n&gt; that people can  \n&gt; learn from a shinsa. I also encourage everyone to\n&gt; ask questions.  \n&gt; There were too few people who picked up their pieces\n&gt; and did not ask  \n&gt; for an explanation. Next time, if there is one for\n&gt; you, ask the guy  \n&gt; taking your money to call me over. I will be happy,\n&gt; or not, to  \n&gt; explain anything you want to know. That is why we\n&gt; are doing a shinsa.  \n&gt; Not to make you feel bad, but to try and share some\n&gt; knowledge with  \n&gt; you. If I was hard on Ted, I am sorry. If Ted would\n&gt; like to contact  \n&gt; me off line, I would be happy to help him understand\n&gt; his results. We  \n&gt; are doing another shinsa in Chicago next April.\n&gt; Please use this  \n&gt; opportunity to learn. Also, if anyone would like to\n&gt; volunteer to help  \n&gt; out along with Milt, let me know and you can share\n&gt; in the process.\n&gt; \n&gt; Gordon\n&gt; \n&gt; On Sep 7, 2006, at 11:46 AM, nihontochicken wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Ron\n&gt; Hartmann&quot; &lt;swords@...&gt;  \n&gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Anyone got anything to report on the sword show\n&gt; and shinsa that took\n&gt; &gt; &gt; place this past weekend???\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Yeah, the judges were entirely unreasonable and\n&gt; were pinking juyo\n&gt; &gt; quality swords.
