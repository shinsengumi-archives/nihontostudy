I&#39;m not sure that it&#39;s meaningful to talk about a Jingo koshirae, or for that matter a Goto koshirae, even if all of the fittings are by one of those makers.\n\nIf the fuchigashira were submitted for kodogu shinsa (while mounted) I don&#39;t think that there would be any problem getting a Jingo attribution if that&#39;s what they are.  I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve seen the tsuka, but it sounds nice.  If it turned out to be later generation Jingo, it would get a &quot;kodai&quot; qualifier, as with the Yagyu tsuba that Cary mentioned yesterday.\n\nJim\n\n\n\n  Hi Jim - \n\n  As an example, I have a tsuka with nice doe skin wrap and what I believe to be Jingo iron fuchi/kashira and menuki. If this opinion is correct (Jingo), having the fittings &quot;in hand&quot; would show them to be mumei anyway. Do you think a shinsa team would make the call to Jingo in a case like this? I&#39;ve often wondered about submitting this tsuka but that&#39;s yet to be done. (Perhaps you saw this tsuba somewhere over the years.)\n\n  Ron\n  STL\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
