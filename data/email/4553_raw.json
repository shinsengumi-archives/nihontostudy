Given the amount of time it takes to do this kind of  \nwork in=\r\n relation to how much you get paid makes translation a rather  \nthankless t=\r\nask. Getting some strokes every now and then makes it all  \nworth while. So=\r\n thanks for this. Next up is Higo Hirata Hikozo with  \nthe same kind of ver=\r\ny in depth analysis. There is more Mito Kinko on  \nthe way as well.\n\nGordon=\r\n\n\nOn Oct 16, 2006, at 1:41 AM, klepet33319 wrote:\n\n&gt; I received the NBTHK A=\r\nB translations of &#39;Elementary Course in Sword\n&gt; Furniture and Fittings (128=\r\n)&#39; on Mito Kinko by Fukushi Shigeo this\n&gt; morning and I can see where you w=\r\nere coming from in your comments on\n&gt; the translation.
