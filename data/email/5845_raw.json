Fairly classic design and at 81mm x 80mm x 5.5mm it\n&gt; &gt; is a nice size. One of the traits here that I find most interesting is\n&gt; &gt; the mimi, and the obvious fold line that appears in it (it covers about\n&gt; &gt; 30% of the mimi). it is almost like the tsuba was made from a two plate\n&gt; &gt; construction, though I am not suggesting that at all. I assume the\n&gt; &gt; original plate was forged, then folded and forged again before shaping.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I cannot nay that I have seen this so clearly before in an Owari guard\n&gt; &gt; before ( I will also note that I got it to jump out a bit with some\n&gt; &gt; clever lighting etc) and wondered if it was a normal trait in Owari \n&gt; works.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I really love the iron on this guard, its been well forged and is in\n&gt; &gt; really good condition.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6144/5934784209_807a0a2719_b.jpg\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6132/5934784543_7aa87f9b4a_b.jpg\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6144/5935345246_1aa21c6a64_b.jpg\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Cheers\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Rich\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
