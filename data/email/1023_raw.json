Unfortunately, the style of the plate, surface finish, inlay, carving and signature are not consistent with real Kaneie.  It is in nice condition and the hitsu ana are well filled.  It&#39;s probably by someone in Saga following the Kaneie style.  That plate treatment is also seen in later Shoami shiiremono work.\nJim\n\n\n\n    Hi Jim, all - \n\n    Been having problems with receiving messages of late but I think it&#39;s fixed now. Please take a look at the three photos of a very nice tsuba owned by a friend of mine. It has a Kaneiye signature which I realize, is a long-shot, but the work is so &quot;flowing&quot; and the treatment, even with the plugged hitsu-ana with nanako, all looks so nice. I told my friend I&#39;d ask for comments on this for him so here it is:\n\n    http://tinyurl.com/u4tx \n\n    Thanks!\n\n    Ron\n    STL\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
