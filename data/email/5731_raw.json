One thing I would suggest is \ngetting a little smarter with your photos as the page takes a long time \nto load. I down loaded one photo and it is 2.3 meg. Given that there are \nmany images there it will slow down the loading considerably and also \neat into peoples bandwith depending on their connection speeds.\n\nThere are some easy ways to alleviate this and if you would like to \ndiscuss them please just let me know. I would be happy to help you.\n\nCheers\n\nRichard Turner\n\n\nOn 13/09/2010 3:20 AM, lorrez_d wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Amazing work you&#39;re doing there !
