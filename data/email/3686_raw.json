Jim or someone\nelse will comment best on this, but I was reading\nthrough Haynes Catalogs last night and did come upon\nacross a section comparing 3 examples of &#39;Nobuiye\nlongmei&#39;. Basically looks like his ana spacing left\nhim too narrow a space for his normal signature and he\nconsequently squeezed out his signature with one\ncharacter at the top and bottom V of area between the\ntwo openings.\n   I don&#39;t know how much of a variation this was\nconsidered.\n\nCurran\n\n\n--- klepet33319 &lt;Ppeterdds@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; Would anyone know of a source for\n&gt; explaination/differentiation of the \n&gt; different mei for Nobuiye?  Akiyama apparently\n&gt; published this but I&#39;ve \n&gt; never been able to find the reference in English.\n&gt; Thanks much!\n&gt; Pete\n&gt; \n&gt; PS:  Good to see you back Jim!!!\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________________ \nYahoo!
