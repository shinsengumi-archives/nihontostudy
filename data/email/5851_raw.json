Fairly classic design and at 81mm x 80mm x 5.5mm it\n&gt;\n&gt; is a ni=\r\nce size. One of the traits here that I find most interesting is\n&gt;\n&gt; the mim=\r\ni, and the obvious fold line that appears in it (it covers about\n&gt;\n&gt; 30% of=\r\n the mimi). it is almost like the tsuba was made from a two plate\n&gt;\n&gt; const=\r\nruction, though I am not suggesting that at all. I assume the\n&gt;\n&gt; original =\r\nplate was forged, then folded and forged again before shaping.\n&gt;\n&gt; I cannot=\r\n nay that I have seen this so clearly before in an Owari guard\n&gt;\n&gt; before (=\r\n I will also note that I got it to jump out a bit with some\n&gt;\n&gt; clever ligh=\r\nting etc) and wondered if it was a normal trait in Owari works.\n&gt;\n&gt; I reall=\r\ny love the iron on this guard, its been well forged and is in\n&gt;\n&gt; really go=\r\nod condition.\n&gt;\n&gt; http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6144/5934784209_807a0a2719=\r\n_b.jpg\n&gt;\n&gt; http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6132/5934784543_7aa87f9b4a_b.jpg\n=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6144/5935345246_1aa21c6a64_b.jpg\n&gt;\n&gt; Che=\r\ners\n&gt;\n&gt; Rich\n&gt;\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n&gt; =\r\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n&gt; \n\n\n[Non-text port=\r\nions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
