Paperback. We\nrequested Bob Orssman look for it, but he could not\nfind it. It is supposedly a $25 book, and not very\nold.\n   Jim G. purchased it from a book dealer. In it there\nare some outstanding rapier style examples, including\nnear matching western pieces upon which they may have\nbeen based.\n\nI do not recall much in the way of cupped guards.\n  Could you please give your opinion against the\ncupped guards being not attributed to westerd style?\nI&#39;ve heard 2 arguments against it, but not in much\ndepth.\n\nAs i mentioned, many of the tsuba &#39;cup&#39; the wrong way.\nThe one I recently picked up is more of a bowl shape\n(more of an L edge to it, but about 1 cm deep), and\nwould have been worn correctly cupped towards the\nhand.\n\nCurran\n\n\nCurran,\nI sure won&#39;t promise any &quot;depth&quot; on this issue. I also don&#39;t know which\nbook you have in mind, but I happen to have Yoshimura&#39;s &quot;Namban Tsuba:\nAkogare No Dezain&quot; with me here. It shows NO cupped guards at all... which\nmerely means they don&#39;t fit his classification.\nI suppose that cupped guards could be reflective of European designs, but\nit seems to be no more than a very general reference. Furthermore, I have\nbecome convince by John Lissenden that most Namban &quot;rapier&quot; guards date to\nthe 18th century. In John&#39;s view the classic &quot;rapier&quot; tsuba appear to be\ncopies not of rapiers but of the later smallsword form  -  which is a\ndevelopment of the 18th century. Cuphilt rapiers, on the other hand, are\n(supposedly!) Spanish and 17th century. Given how things were in Japan at\nthat time, I wonder how common they could have been in Japan. Maybe, of\ncourse, that could explain how the samurai could have got the cup pointing\nin the wrong direction!\nPeter\n\n_\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
