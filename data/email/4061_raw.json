Please\n&gt; ignore the spots of high red. I&#39;m still experimenting\n&gt; with photography and did not clean these images at\n&gt; all.\n&gt;\n&gt; The shishi tsuba is nice. The nanako is very good and\n&gt; interesting in that it changes pattern on the sections\n&gt; with the shi-shi. My hesitation is that the general\n&gt; work is very good but not Goto grade. How else might\n&gt; this one be attributed?\n&gt;\n&gt; The second tsuba is solid shakudo of excellent color\n&gt; and very heavy. The carving is lush and extremely\n&gt; detailed. Despite the thickness of the piece and the\n&gt; carving, everything has a smooth roundedness to it so\n&gt; that there are no obtruding edges.\n&gt;\n&gt; Any help appreciated. I&#39;d like to figure these out as\n&gt; much as possible before I consider whether to submit\n&gt; to shinsa.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt;\n&gt; Curran\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; __________________________________________________\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?\n&gt; Tired of spam?
