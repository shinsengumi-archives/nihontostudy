Or in all cases?)\n\nGiven that you might destroy your poorly made sword, and a poorly made\nsword is even less likely to survive the process, I would think you&#39;d\njust heat the whole thing, quench, sharpen, and toss in the bundle.\n\nIt doesn&#39;t take that long to heat harden the whole thing, plus will not\ndestroy the sword.\n\nOn the signature stuff... Bishu = worse than Bizen I understand to apply\nonly to Sue Bizen swords. \n\nMy *guess* would be that the amount of effort going into cutting the mei\nindicates the care taken... Bishu Osafune Sukesada/Kiyomitsu is easier\nto carve than Bizen Kuni Osafune Ju Sukesada/Kiyomitsu.\n\nAs well as no date...\n\nBut for these swords that seem to have reasonably good construction, are\nsigned Bishu Osafune XX, and have a hamon showing activity... is it fair\nto call those mass produced swords?\n\nAfter all, the workmanship is showing things not associated with mass\nproduction. It&#39;s only the signature that is saying something. So is it a\n&quot;bad&quot; rule of thumb to judge these exclusively based on signature?\n\nOr are there just different levels to the mass-production. Maybe less\nskilled people/apprentices are given the work of making the Bishu\nOsafune stuff while the talented guys are taking their time with the\nbetter items?\n\n- darcy\n \n\n\n"
