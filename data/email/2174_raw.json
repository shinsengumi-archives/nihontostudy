Just got done\nwatching a Japanese sword take 7 hits from a Browning\nM-2 .50 cal machine gun firing FMJ (Full Metal Jacket)\nrounds. I have to give the blade its dues it took 7\nhits prior to snapping off. This from the same show\nthat fired at a sword with what I believe was a .44\nMagnum could be wrong it was a while back. Just wanted\nto let everyone know to keep an eye out for the clip.\nInteresting to see the blade slice through the rounds\nalthough the copper jacket did a number on the blade\ntaking a chunk of the Ha with each hit until finally\nthe blade just failed. \n\nBob R\n\n=====\nCheck out &quot;Cowboy&quot; Bob&#39;s Books & Things at:\nhttp://asia.geocities.com/gentleman9/index.htm\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
