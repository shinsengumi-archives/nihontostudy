I bought it from S=\r\nkip Holbrook, and that&#39;s where the \nattribution came\n&gt; from, I think becaus=\r\ne of the sahari inlay work reminding one of \nsimilar work\n&gt; by the Kunitomo=\r\n gunsmiths. No one who saw this tsuba, Jim Gilbert, \nBob\n&gt; Haynes, etc. cou=\r\nld think of anything better to call it.

I see no signature so I am assuming it was sold to \n=\r\nyou with\n&gt; &gt; an attribution, or is papered ?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Cheers\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Richard=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Elliott wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi all,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; This is a continuan=\r\nce of my &#39;questions&#39; and some new ones....\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; In my photo album, I=\r\n have added new pictures (#1 and #2) of a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Kunitomo piece.
