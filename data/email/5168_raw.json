I got an email I don&#39;t think it was from you,\nbut I was getting offered a second chance before the\nauction was even over.  That was a big clue!  Always\ngo check your emails from ebay through the My ebay\n-message center area,  if it isn&#39;t there it didn&#39;t go\nthrough their system.  I thought I got a good deal\nwhen I won the auction I wonder if they scared off\nbidders?\n\ngood luck everyone.  Don&#39;t forget to send me any\nmantis items, It was my b-day yesterday and looks like\nI have managed to buy a tsuba, fuchi/kashira, kozuka,\nand I will be bidding on a single mantis menuki\ntoday/tomorrow better look.  So I almost got a\ncomplete  set.  Luckily, family comes through with\nmonetary gifts so the presents I got myself total\nprice tag has been reduced!  I have no control! \nactually it is more like 2 tsuba and maybe 2 F/K.\nwhoops! TO the addicted, I salute you.\nKen Wilson aka &quot;The Mantis Dude&quot; \n--- MuramasaIII@... wrote:\n\n&gt;  \n&gt; In a message dated 9/11/2007 4:16:45 P.M.
