JUYO COMMENT\n\n\n&gt; Matthew Hoyle wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Right and now on to the sword that I have for sale.\n&gt; &gt; This Nambokucho (14th century) sword was\n&gt; &gt; purchased last year from Aoi Arts in Japan...\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I was toying with the idea of submitting it to Juyo Shinsa,\n&gt; &gt; but have so far not got round to it. I don&#39;t know if it\n&gt; &gt; would stand a chance of going Juyo, but I think that it\n&gt; &gt; should be submitted if only just for the experience which\n&gt; &gt; would be very educational in my opinion...\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;...should be submitted if only just for the experience...&quot; - With the\nrecent\n&gt; increases in shinsa costs I believe this experience (of submitting a sword\nto\n&gt; the NBTHK Juyo shinsa) can cost US$3,000 over and above &quot;the education&quot;??\nAnd\n&gt; it must first pass the Tokubetsu Hozon shinsa.  I would think that very,\nvery\n&gt; few swords could go straight from Hozon to the Juyo shinsa.  All in all,\nVERY\n&gt; expensive.  Friends of mine have tried in aggregate FOUR times for Juyo\nshinsa\n&gt; and 3 failed.  Payment is in advance and no refund if your sword doesn&#39;t\n&quot;get\n&gt; up&quot;.\n&gt;\n&gt; A mate of mine was in Japan staying with his polisher.  The togishi was\n&gt; repolishing a sword that was already Juyo - ALREADY JUYO, note.  It was\nbeing\n&gt; repolished because there were features of that particular smith that were\nnot\n&gt; evident in its present state of polish as a Juyo-ranked sword.  The\nrepolish was\n&gt; successful as the sword made Tokubetsu Juyo and the polisher won an annual\nprize\n&gt; for the work.\n&gt;\n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt;\n&gt; Barry Thomas\n&gt; (Melbourne, Australia)\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
