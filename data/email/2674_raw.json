I cannot answer your question directly, but for whatever its\nfailings might or might not be, I understand that the photographs in the\n1st were taken from fittings actually seen rather than being photographs\nof photographs as is common. I am sure that the highest value added\nwould be  from the 1st and translation, along with a list of the gimei\nif known. Arnold \n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; craigharris@... 02/25/05 11:34 PM &gt;&gt;&gt;\n\nI have a question from a customer about the editions of the Kinko\nMeikan.\nThe original edition published in 1974 has four mei photos per page, and\nthere is a wonderfully handy translation published by the NCJSC that was\ndone by John Yumoto and Alan Harvie, which is still available from the\nclub.\n \nObviously the translation makes this edition far more desirable to\nnon-readers of Japanese than the later edition(s) which show six mei\nphotos\nper page, and of course do not match up with the translation at all.\n \nMy question has to do with my recollection - it was perhaps even a\ndiscussion on one of the lists long ago - that the problem with the\nfirst\nedition was the significant number of gimei signatures illustrated, and\nperhaps other errors. These were then corrected in the later editions.\n \nI&#39;ve searched what archives I have to verify this bit of information\nkicking\naround my aging and untrustworthy brain without success. Can anyone\ncorroborate or refute this or shed any light on the subject?\n \nAnd before anyone asks, I&#39;m out of stock on the first edition, but you\ncan\nadd your name to the want list. Second edition orders will be filled\nright\naway!\n \n \nCraig L.
