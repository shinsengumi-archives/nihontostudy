The idea was \nbased on my seeing a need for a more comprehensive and \nmonitored/moderated source of Nihonto information on the world wide \nweb that would be easily accessible to anyone seeking or having \ninformation on our favorite subject.\n\nPlease browse to http://www.nihontopedia.org/ or \nhttp://www.nihontopedia.com/ and take a look. You will need to create \na user id before it will let you publish anything. At this point in \ntime, I am the only sysop/admin. As you and the rest of the \nenthusiasts post articles, this will surely overwhelm me, especially \nsince I am by no means an expert yet. Let me know if you&#39;re \ninterested in sharing the sysop role with me and I&#39;ll consider all \nrespondents on a case by case basis.\n\nI&#39;m footing the bill for this, both from an administrative as well as \na server/bandwidth perspective, so please bear with me while I work \nout some of the kinks, technically and operationally. Also, please \nsend me your thoughts, ideas, concerns and anything else related to \nthis little project of mine.\n\nThe wiki is 100% empty now, I was going to write a few articles but \nit&#39;s the end of the week and I only just now finished setting it up \nto where I think it&#39;s stable. Which reminds me, any bugs you notice, \nlet me know.\n\nIf you like the idea, and I know there are a lot of extremely \nknowledgeable nihonto experts here, please start posting some \narticles. Also, please send the url out to your contacts not on the \ntwo lists I&#39;m posting this to, Nihonto and NihontoStudy on Yahoo Groups.\n\nThanks for reading, and I hope you like it!\n\nBest Regards,\n\nAndres Pedraza\n\n\n"
