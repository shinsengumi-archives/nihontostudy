I\ncertainly have. By sticking my neck out and giving an\nopinion here, I&#39;ve probably just ticked off a dealer\nwho now is going to send evil thoughts my way.\n\nThere are a lot of dealers out there who are very\nhonest and take small profit for their pains. Do them\ncredit.\n   Lordy knows it pains me to go through the process\nof selling anything. Absolutely hate to even try! This\npast year I picked up 2 lots of exceptionally good\ntsuba and am only going to keep about 40% of them. I&#39;m\nin the process of papering them (slow process)and\ndeciding which to keep. I planned to let an auction\nhouse sell them, but learned the auction houses get\ntheir pound of flesh! Unless I give them over $100,000\nof items... they take a greater % than any dealer I\nknow.\n    As the tsuba come back from Japan, I&#39;ll just put\nthem out at Tampa sword show and possibly Chicago--\nbut ultimately a few of them will probably end up with\na dealer.\n\nSo go easy on the dealers. Many are good people who\nprovide a service to buyers and sellers. There are 2\nor 3 I call friend.\n\nCurran\n\nPs. The &#39;Saotome&#39; have a shakudo edge?\n\n\n\n\n--- Elliott &lt;elliott@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; Curran,\n&gt; \n&gt; Thank you! And it only hurts a little.\n&gt; \n&gt; I bought this tsuba and another from one of the many\n&gt; &#39;dealers&#39; who \n&gt; spout their so-called knowledge of Nihonto but don&#39;t\n&gt; know their ass \n&gt; from a hole-in-the-ground (and who will remain\n&gt; nameless). I learned \n&gt; a very good lesson..........Be very careful about\n&gt; what you are being \n&gt; sold and how much money your spending. Since they\n&gt; didn&#39;t cost me \n&gt; alot, this lesson was worth the money. \n&gt; \n&gt; As soon as I take some pictures of the other, I will\n&gt; submit them for \n&gt; a consult.\n&gt; \n&gt; The Saotome piece I have in my album is fabulous. I\n&gt; should hope to \n&gt; never sell it. \n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; \n&gt; Elliott\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com, Curran Campbell\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;neobliviscar@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Elliott,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The good:\n&gt; &gt; There are some nice tsuba in your in your folder.\n&gt; I\n&gt; &gt; like the Sukeyoshi and the one labeled Saotome.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The bad:\n&gt; &gt; Photos #19 & #20 are of a shiiremono (mass\n&gt; produced)\n&gt; &gt; tsuba.
