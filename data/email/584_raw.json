It wouldn&#39;t be reasonable (or polite) to pester you to make custom boxes for them all. \n\nI think there must be tsuba bags.  I&#39;ll keep an eye out at the upcoming shows.\n\nDavid\n\n \n\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: Bob Rossman \n  To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Saturday, July 19, 2003 5:31 AM\n  Subject: [nihontostudy] tsuba boxes\n\n\n  David, \n\n  Do me a favor, if you have access to a photocopier\n  take a photocopy of the Tsuba you want a new box for\n  and mail it to me, I&#39;ll see if I can make you one that\n  will hold up a bit better and be a custom fit. Though\n  it will probably be made of Oak, Cherry, or Mahogany.\n  I haven&#39;t made any boxes for a while and it seems like\n  such a waste for that woodshop to go unused by me lol.\n  Only thing is you&#39;ll probably have to use the pillows\n  from an old box because I don&#39;t have a sewing machine\n  to make them. (yea I know how to sew big deal)\n\n  Bob R\n\n  =====\n  Check out &quot;Cowboy&quot; Bob&#39;s Books & Things at:\n  http://asia.geocities.com/gentleman9/index.html\n\n  __________________________________\n  Do you Yahoo!?\n  SBC Yahoo!
