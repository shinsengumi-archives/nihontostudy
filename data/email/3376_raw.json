The text version of those\n&gt; kanji in Wakayama match the ones in Haynes.  The carved versions of\n&gt; the kanji do look quite different from the printed ones, hence your\n&gt; confusion.\n&gt;\n&gt; The modern text version of the first kanji is so different from the\n&gt; carved one that I wouldn&#39;t recognize it on my own.  The second kanji\n&gt; is a shorthand version of the printed example, but would be very\n&gt; difficult to recognize without textual context.  I&#39;d be interested in\n&gt; knowing the orthographic history of the first kanji -- it doesn&#39;t look\n&gt; like a post-war simplification.  Does anyone know?\n&gt;\n&gt; Jim\n\n"
