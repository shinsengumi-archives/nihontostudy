While not always to my personal taste, there\nwere a number of Mito lines producing very high quality fittings.  Several\nof these Mito lineage founders were students of leading kinko artists.  No\ndoubt the Mito Tokugawa branch family (with 350,000 koku revenue) and their\nretainers were responsible for supporting these many skilled workers.\n\n  The standardized plates, designs taken from copy books, large scale\nproduction and relatively poor quality are characteristics of the Mito\nShoami.  Aizu Shoami workers did a lot of the same.\n\n  There are some rather poor quality, unsigned Mito tsuba as well.  It&#39;s\nprobably possible to find a group of better than average Mito Shoami work\nthat exceeds the quality of the bottom of Mito production.  These lesser\npieces are probably the source of the confusion between Mito and Mito\nShoami.  I have seen some fairly insipid mumei tsuba with kanteisho to Mito.\n\n  It&#39;s true that better Mito workers did copy Nara, Hamano and others, but\ntheir copy work is nothing like the Mito Shoami stuff after the Nara style.\nIf anything the workmanship of the Mito copies is a bit over the top\ncompared with the originals.  It&#39;s also usually signed by the maker.\n\n  There was a book on published 5-10 years ago on Mito swords and tosogu.\nMine is out on loan and I don&#39;t remember the title or author&#39;s name.  Does\nanyone have one handy?  In any event, that&#39;s a good book to look through to\nget a feel for the better Mito work.\n\n  Jim\n\n\n\n    Rich,\n    I think you are mistaken in your appraisal of Mito work, the Mito Shoami\n    never achieved much prominence but the Mito Kinko are among the best\nartists\n    who ever made fittings, particularly in the late Edo/Meiji periods with\n    artists like Hagiya Katsuhei and Unno Shomin. They were also very able\n    copyists, I remember Mr Ono some years ago showed me a well known Somin\n    kozuka of a horse (seen from the rear) in takazogan, I asked him how to\ntell\n    the real thing from a Mito copy, he said the only difference was that in\nthe\n    copy the horse stood more proud, or was it the other way around?\n    Alan\n\n\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n        Yahoo!
