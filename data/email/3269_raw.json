Sword books and \n&gt; kodogu references tend to follow simple rules and if you learn to \n&gt; recognize a handful of &quot;signpost&quot; kanji you&#39;ll be able to navigate \n&gt; them and glean much of the info.\n&gt; With sword signatures saku or tsukuru are usually preceeded \n&gt; by the two characters of the smiths name (you&#39;ll need O&#39;neill). \n&gt; Kuni,ju and (no)Kami are preceeded by place names, usually two \n&gt; characters (in the Nelson indecies). The character shu is usually \n&gt; part of the &quot;Chinese&quot; name of a province (also found in the Nelson \n&gt; indecies). nen, tsuki,hi(jitsu) and dai are usually preceeded by \n&gt; numbers, the year, month, day and generation respectively. Of course \n&gt; nen can follow a zodaiacal character like year of the rat, year of \n&gt; the tiger, (these characters are also found in the indecies).\n&gt; Most descriptions follow sugata, jigane, hamon, nakago and \n&gt; background. It is in the background that one can get lost as these \n&gt; are usually given in regular Japanese, not &quot;swordspeak.&quot; Even then if \n&gt; you can learn to recognize dai, jidai, nen, kuni, den, (ryu)ha, \n&gt; deshi, and mon, you can get a lot out of what seem undecipherable \n&gt; paragraphs. Mon by the way means gate, Masatsune mon would translate \n&gt; &quot;Masatsune school&quot;, as in &quot;he studied within the gate of Masatsune&quot; \n&gt; or &quot;in the Masatsune school&quot;. Often rendered as &quot;student of&quot; it can \n&gt; mean that he may not have been a direct student but was a product of \n&gt; that group, if it was a large school or the relationship isn&#39;t clear.\n&gt; For tsuba the signatures follow similar rules though one \n&gt; encounters a wider use of GO or art names. Regular dictionaries don&#39;t \n&gt; really help there, I suggest Haynes or the Kinko Meikan. The \n&gt; descriptions usually follow Subject, shape, plate, engraving and \n&gt; inlay. So look for zu,sugata,ita,hori and zogan, knowing the terms \n&gt; from glossaries you&#39;ll quickly start to recognize the kanji as they \n&gt; are repeated in many listings.\n&gt; In general I think reading swordspeak, learning to read \n&gt; swordspeak is easy, learn the hiragana and a handful of kanji and you \n&gt; can get a lot out of those books. Please bear in mind I type all this \n&gt; not for you as I am sure you know much of this already, rather it is \n&gt; intended for those the list that might be having similar troubles...\n&gt; -t\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n"
