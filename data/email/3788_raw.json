But I think cart before the horse. As the \nearly swo=\r\nrdsmiths made their own tsuba with sword to hand and could \nbe fitted in si=\r\ntu the use of shims of any form would be unnecessary. \nAs swords are forged=\r\n by a particular smith the general dimensions \nwould have been consistent a=\r\nnd the nakago-ana would have been made \nconsistent to these dimensions. As =\r\nthe fabrication of tsuba became a \ncottage industry, dependent on the sword=\r\nsmith hence the close \nproximity of them, the tsuba-ko had to fit their tsu=\r\nba not knowing \nwhat measurements they may see and the sekigane shims devel=\r\noped. The \neffect that had on the ability to absorb shock or reduce wear wo=\r\nuld \nhave been a subsequent discovery. Also may I suggest that sekigane \nma=\r\ny have been added to some tsuba later that had worn loose to \ntighten the t=\r\nsuka as well as adding seppa.The rattle of a loose \ntsuba is extremely anno=\r\nying. These are just my take on the possible \ndevelopment of such. \nJohn   =\r\n                                                              \n--- In nihon=\r\ntostudy@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Jim Gilbert&quot; &lt;jggilbert@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m up t=\r\no date on email...not.  Interesting idea Pete.  Bushu \nKunihiro used the sa=\r\nme type of sekigane.  Akasaka Tadashige made \nthem some of the time as well=\r\n.  The Toryusai group used a smaller, \ndifferent form, but still standardiz=\r\ned inlaid sekigane.  Anyway, the \nSuruga, et al, style of sekigane is often=\r\n seen quite beaten down and \nit may well have been originally done with the=\r\n intention of saving \nthe iron plate from abuse.  I don&#39;t know whether it w=\r\nould have \naffected wear of the nakago.\n&gt; \n&gt; Jim   \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   Good day t=\r\no all.  I was looking at a Bizen Suruga tsuba and \nreading up \n&gt;   on the s=\r\nchool in comparison to Bizen Shoami when it occured to \nme that \n&gt;   the pl=\r\nacement of the kuchi beni (sekigane) by the tsubako as \npart of \n&gt;   the de=\r\nsign may have been a purposeful endeavor to reduce wear to \nthe \n&gt;   nakago=\r\n or possible shock-related fracture to the tsuba as well \nas for \n&gt;   the f=\r\nitting of the blade.  It just hit me that the use of a more \n&gt;   plastic me=\r\ntal would result in a two-fold benefit of helping to \nprevent \n&gt;   these na=\r\nmed problems and also in fascilitating the fitting and \nlater \n&gt;   tighteni=\r\nng of the tsuba to it&#39;s sword.  That this practice \noccured in \n&gt;   Bizen c=\r\nould make sense in that they had a long history of sword \n&gt;   manufacture a=\r\nnd when the Haruta family moved to Bizen and began \ntsuba \n&gt;   fabrication =\r\n(Tsuba An Aesthetic Study pg. 31)they looked for \nadvice \n&gt;   from the loca=\r\nl smiths and began placement of the copper shims on \ntheir \n&gt;   observation=\r\ns/advice.  Just a bit of conjecture but as I have \nseen \n&gt;   swords with co=\r\nnsiderable wear to the nakago from ill-fitting \n&gt;   (assumption) tsuba it m=\r\nay be a plausible assumption.  The \nplacement at \n&gt;   the top and bottom wo=\r\nuld also seem to make sense as the primary \naxis of \n&gt;   shock-force delive=\r\nry would occur on this plane from \nstrike/rebound \n&gt;   energy and would hel=\r\np explain why circumfirential placement was \nnot \n&gt;   utilized.  Interestin=\r\ng.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n\n\n=\r\n\n\n\n\n"
