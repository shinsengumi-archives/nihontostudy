The one I made has continued to dry and is now pretty difficult to flex.  Mine is a three layer, which is the simplest construction I&#39;ve seen.  Most are 4 or 5 layer and I&#39;ve seen one six layer guard.  I think that crossing the grain makes sense.  I couldn&#39;t detect a  consistent grain in the rawhide I used, so I don&#39;t know if the layers are optimally arranged. \n\nThe lacquered examples I&#39;ve seen didn&#39;t show signs of lacquering between the layers.  Many of the early ones at Oyamazumi have delaminated, so whatever the glue was, it failed at some point over the last 800 years.  Many of those guards show no trace of lacquer at all, while the saya and tsuka of the same koshirae are still intact.  I don&#39;t know if the tsuba were not lacquered originally, or if the lacquer was not as stable on the leather as it is on wood.  Maybe the leather expands and contracts more with changes in temperature and/or humidity causing the lacquer to flake off.\n\nThe Nanbokucho era nerikawa tsuba were in better shape.  I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s because of lesser age or an improvement in manufacturing technique or something else.\nJim\n\n\n\n  I think also we forget that dried, lacquered leather can\n  be as hard a rock and not very flexible. I have a lacquered\n  leather jingasa that is totally rigid and hard. \n\n  Also, perhaps (?) the way the leather is laid down in layers\n  has something to do with the rigidity and hardness. If\n  the grain is laid down at 90 degrees in the different\n  layers, it may (?) make a difference. Also the type of\n  glue used could effect it although I suspect that rice\n  glue was what was commonly used. Does lacquer itself\n  have &quot;glue&quot; properties? Maybe the layers were lacquered\n  together to greater strength as well as having a lacquer\n  coat for weather proofing.\n\n  Just more thinking/speculating out loud. Interesting\n  thread. I&#39;ll have to try my hand at making a leather\n  tsuba too :-)\n\n  rich\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
