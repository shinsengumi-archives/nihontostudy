Practically straight out of the\nSatsuma koshirae book.\n\nThe tsuba didn&#39;t knock my socks off, but was a good\ntsuba a bit afield from what I collect. Interesting\npiece.\n   I realized then that either I have overlooked any\nnicer Satsuma tsuba on the market, or maybe they\nsimply don&#39;t come to market that often? Anyone able to\npoint me at some Satsuma tsuba in Japan or give me a\nfair ballpark what sort of value they carry in Japan?\nI&#39;d love to see other examples, if anyone has photos.\nI haven&#39;t much looked for them before, but now am a\nlittle more curious to learn about them.\n\nCurran\n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?
