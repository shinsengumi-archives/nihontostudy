While hardly a scientific sample, what I did \nwas to go\n&gt; through the Tokyo National Museum Uchigatana Koshirae book and \nrecord the\n&gt; tsuba diameter, saya length and tsuka length for each illustrated \nkatana or\n&gt; wakizashi koshirae.  It&#39;s somewhat interesting to play with.\n&gt; \n&gt; It turns out that correlation between saya length (a proxy for \nblade length)\n&gt; and tsuba diameter is fairly weak.  The correlation between tsuka \nlength and\n&gt; tsuba size is actually better.  The correlation between saya length \nand\n&gt; tsuka length is very good.\n&gt; \n&gt; The average katana tsuba is 8.03 cm in diameter, but the range is \n5.85-10.80\n&gt; cm.\n&gt; The average wakizashi tsuba is 6.59 cm in diameter, with a range of \n4.90 to\n&gt; 8.60 cm.\n&gt; \n&gt; So, making definite statements about katana-size or wakizashi-sized \ntsuba on\n&gt; size alone is pretty difficult.  There are no dates given for most \nof the\n&gt; koshirae in the book, so that is not included in the spreadsheet.  \nThere&#39;s\n&gt; more work to do here.\n&gt; \n&gt; Jim\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Jim G. actually created a database from the uchigatana book, but \nI&#39;m not\n&gt; &gt; sure he put the dates in so I can&#39;t xref to that.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; rkg\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Richard Turner wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;This is an interesting topic, I have just been lent The Picture \nBook of\n&gt; Old Tsuba by Robert Burawoy to read and enjoy and there are several \nof these\n&gt; &gt; &gt;very tsuba in this book. I remember reading that the tsuba size \nchanged\n&gt; when fighting went from one handed mounted to two handed ground \nfighting.\n&gt; There are several nice smaller cast pieces in this book that are \nfrom the\n&gt; nambokucho period. There is also a very nice red lacquer that was a \nused by\n&gt; certain Priests I believe that loos spectacular. I will research \nthis more\n&gt; later in the day and respond with proper information.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;cheers\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Rich Turner\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;---\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Outgoing mail is certified Virus Free.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Checked by AVG anti-virus system (http://www.grisoft.com).\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Version: 6.0.471 / Virus Database: 269 - Release Date: 10/04/2003\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;nihontostudy-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Your use of Yahoo!
