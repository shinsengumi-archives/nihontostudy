Or anywhere&#39;s on\nthe web?\n\nVowels are fairly simple, as follows:\n\n&quot;a&quot; = &quot;ah&quot; as in bob, got, malt, paw, shawl, taught, thought.\n&quot;e&quot; = &quot;eh&quot; as in bed, get, melt, peg, shell, threat.\n&quot;i&quot; = &quot;ee&quot; as in bead, greet, me, pea, she, think.\n&quot;o&quot; = &quot;oh&quot; as in bode, goat, mow, pour, sew, though.\n&quot;u&quot; = &quot;oo&quot; as in boot, goof, moot, new, pool, sue, shoe, suit, through.\n&quot;ai&quot; = &quot;uy&quot; as in bite, buy, eye, height, my, pie, rye, sign, thigh.\n&quot;ei&quot; = &quot;ay&quot; as in bait, bay, gate, may, pail, shale, they.\n\n&quot;g&quot; is always hard, as in &quot;get&quot;, never soft, as in &quot;germ&quot;.\n\nThere are some trickier parts, like &quot;ko&quot; + &quot;katana&quot; = &quot;kogatana&quot;, and\n&quot;Matsushita&quot; is pronounced &quot;Mat-soosh-ta&quot; (no shit, er, &quot;sheet&quot;!), but\nthe above general rules will get you through 90%+ of the battle. \nActually quite simple - look again at the various English spellings\nthat yield the same sound, depending on the word.  Note that in\nEnglish, for instance, &quot;dead&quot; is not pronounced the same as &quot;meat&quot;. \nMany English pronunciations have to be individually learned, unlike\nmost Japanese words.  Good fortune!\n\nNC\n\n\n\n"
