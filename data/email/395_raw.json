I wanted to inquire, but\nthe discussion moved on, and I didn&#39;t get a chance.  I made a note of the\nterm to look it up, and found Hawley&#39;s definition, which applied to a sword\nI have at home.\n:\n: I think the definition you have provided is more likely what Cary and the\ngang were talking about, though obviously odd in the case of such an old\nsword.  Thanks for the information.\n:\n:\n:   ----- Original Message -----\n:   From: Jim Gilbert\n:   To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com\n:   Sent: Monday, June 23, 2003 8:23 PM\n:   Subject: Re: [nihontostudy] Ubuha\n:\n:\n:   David,\n:   I don&#39;t think there are different forms... it&#39;s a short section of\n&quot;unsharpened&quot; edge just above the hamachi.  It&#39;s not unusual with gendaito,\nbut is rather rare in older blades.  It is ground away as the blade is\npolished over time.\n:\n:   Very old and very good saiha swords that are otherwise intact can\nsometimes get kanteisho.\n:\n:   Hopefully someone more knowledgeable about swords can comment.\n:\n:   Jim\n:\n:\n:     Can anyone think of any publications featuring illustrations of\ndifferent\n:     forms of ubuha?\n:\n:     Do retempered swords ever receive papers?\n:\n:\n:\n:   [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n:\n:\n:         Yahoo!
