I was just curious.\n   At the same time I saw these two odd-guys, I saw a\ntsuba with another stylized frog / toad wearing a\nsimilar quirked expression. An wise man or priest was\nstanding in the backgound overlooking the frog with a\njovial look on his face.\n   I did no know if there was a story here. Other than\nKermit, I&#39;m not too fond of frogs.\n\nCurran\n\n\n\n--- Jim Gilbert &lt;jggilbert@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Curran,\n&gt; For what it&#39;s worth I used to have a pair of menuki\n&gt; in exactly that &quot;pose&quot; that were signed on the edge\n&gt; Yoshioka Inabanosuke.  They were better quality than\n&gt; these appear to be, and were not what I&#39;d think of\n&gt; as typical Yoshioka group work.  It can be tough to\n&gt; attribute a lot of the unsigned later menuki to a\n&gt; specific group.\n&gt; \n&gt; Jim\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   Groups-\n&gt; \n&gt;   Came across these unusual menuki. Figured it might\n&gt;   interest some others.\n&gt; \n&gt;   http://www.l-wise.co.jp/sword/sdata24/clk259b.htm\n&gt; \n&gt;   Any chance anyone can attribute this ugly duo to\n&gt; any\n&gt;   specific school? I&#39;m assuming they are late late\n&gt; Edo\n&gt;   or Meiji.\n&gt; \n&gt;   Curran\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been\n&gt; removed]\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nNew Yahoo!
