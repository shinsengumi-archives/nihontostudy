I would not be surprised to see the same treatment \ndone in Tosa Myochin works. I think if a smith liked a theme, or maybe \neven mores the case , &#39;I saw your Akasaka tsuba while you were visiting \nmy house and had one made by my local guy&#39; then the copying of themes in \ntsuba could be rife.\n\nMy late Akasaka ( we think ) example.\nhttp://www.nihontomessageboard.com/tsuba_collection/akasaka-horse.jpg\n\nRich\n\n\n\nJim Gilbert wrote:\n\n&gt; David,\n&gt; The same motif often appears through groups spread around the \n&gt; country.  Since we were talking Akasaka, many of the later Akasaka \n&gt; guards (made in Edo) were lifted directly from work originating in \n&gt; Higo (Kyushu).  Of course there are also general motifs that persist \n&gt; across long spans of time and space.  That&#39;s culture.\n&gt;\n&gt; There are extant pattern books for later iroe shiiremono tsuba.  I \n&gt; don&#39;t think that I&#39;ve seen one for sukashi guards, but they might have \n&gt; existed.  But, think about our own culture... there are many common \n&gt; and persistent motifs that aren&#39;t set forth in a pattern book.\n&gt;\n&gt; The doubled elements at 12:00 and 6:00 are myoga - ginger shoots.  At \n&gt; 3:00 and 9:00 are of course tea whisks.  On the diagonals are folding \n&gt; fans and linking them all are birds.  The inside of the rim is a very \n&gt; loose kiri.  The groups of three dots that you mention as problematic \n&gt; are a standard part of the depiction of myoga in that period.\n&gt;\n&gt; Jim\n&gt;\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
