Many of you will recall the discussions that went on years ago (Tom Buttweiler days) regarding Ezo menuki. \n\n  This pair could very well fit the bill for Ezo, but I don&#39;t know. They are rather thin base material and are fairly large, measuring 49 mm (1.9&quot;), thereabout. They do not have posts. The base material could be a yamagani and has the &quot;worn&quot; gold wash that Ezo display. \n\n  The other question regarding these menuki, what motif are they representing? The creature appears to have the body of a shishi but the face of a beaked tengo. Anybody have an answer to this?\n\n  Interesting menuki that hmmmm, should had maybe stayed with the other &quot;Hartmann menuki&quot;...oh well. \n\n  Ron\n  STL\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
