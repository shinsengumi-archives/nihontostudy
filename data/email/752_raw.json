Jim has been fighting heart disease for quite\nsome time now and apparently he died in his sleep while taking a nap.\nAs\nmany of you know Jim was one of the &quot;old timers&quot; in the sword collecting\nworld and specialized in Koto pieces.  He was always willing to share\nhis\nknowledge with others and was a firm believer that one could never have\ntoo\nmany reference books.  Jim was a special friend and will really be\nmissed by\nthose of us who were fortunate to know him and share his enthusiasm for\nNihonto. It is my understanding that there will be a funeral this Friday\nbut\nI do not have the details at this time.\n\nRoger\n\n\nYahoo!
