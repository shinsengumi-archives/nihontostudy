Most &quot;real&quot; \ndealers will make comments\nabout how buying a new sword is like buying a new car - you lose money \nthe moment you\ndrive it off the lot and/or will make disparaging comments about how \nthey don&#39;t consider them\n&quot;real&quot; swords and don&#39;t look at them much or...  And a lot of &quot;real&quot; \nsword collectors are also\nof this opinion....\n\nOn the other hand, I&#39;ve heard it said that the better modern stuff is as \ngood as or better than\nall but the best of the shinto era pieces. (I personally think this is \ncloser to correct, but then\nagain, I&#39;m crazy enough to actually have a couple modern pieces, so \nYMMV...).\n\nIf you wish to buy one, its a real minefield - there are a LOT of extant \npieces out there, often\nat prices far below what the person who originally \npurchased/commissioned the piece\nprobably paid, but then again, an object is really only worth what the \nnext guy is willing to pay\nfor it, but I digress...  Because of this, I&#39;m not sure I&#39;d consider \nhaving one commissioned - just\nlook for a extant piece in the style you like by the maker you like with \nthe activities you like to pop up\n(it sounds nuts, but it does seem to eventually happen...).\nYou also have to realize that you probably will end up selling it at a \nloss if you ever decide to.\n\nThere&#39;s a whole market built up around mukansa and mukansa wannabee \nlevel stuff versus guys\nwho don&#39;t enter the competitions/don&#39;t win, yada yada - perhaps a trip \nto the shinsakuto site\nlisted on rich&#39;s site would help you learn more about this...\n\n\nGood Luck,\n\nrkg\n(Richard George)\n\n&gt;You are right --again -- so I won&#39;t shut up.  But I can be more \n&gt;careful about what I say, and about what I comment on.  Like what \n&gt;something is worth.  \n&gt;\n&gt;Any thoughts on shinsakudo?\n&gt;\n&gt;--doug\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt;nihontostudy-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;\n&gt;Your use of Yahoo!
