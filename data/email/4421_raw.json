I learned (at the SF Token Kai)from \n  Robert Haynes that a tsuba I had (I could not read the signature)was \n  made by Sukeyoshi. It is signed Sukeyoshi Saku. Robert told me he was \n  a swordsmith who made tsuba and signed his &#39;Suke&#39; differently than his \n  swords. \n\n  Where can I read more about Sukeyoshi? Do you have any knowledge of \n  this smith?\n\n  Thanks,\n  Elliott\n\n\n\n   \n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
