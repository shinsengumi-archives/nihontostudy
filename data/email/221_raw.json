Some here in Japan;\nhowever, have commented that the Gassan pieces said to date from Heian to\nNambokucho period are clearly Mid-Muromachi. Once again, the Sano has\nstirred up controversy with a very unusual show. Sorry I missed it. I will\ngo through the catalogue when I have a chance and give a summary.\n\nGordon\n  -----Original Message-----\n  From: Ron Hartmann [mailto:swords@...]\n  Sent: Saturday, May 10, 2003 5:16 AM\n  To: TOKEN; nihontostudy; nihonto@yahoogroups.com\n  Subject: [nihontostudy] Sano Museum catalogue\n\n\n  The following was posted today by Arnold.  I also wonder what is said\nabout the Gassan swords and their importance relative to this catalogue.  It\nseem early Gassan works are seldom seen illustrated and therefore not a lot\nof written material comes out regarding them.  I owned an early Gassan\nkatana until passing on to a good friend here in St. Louis.  Even with a\nserious lamination fault in the kissaki it received relatively high &quot;points&quot;\nfrom the September 2001 NTHK Chicago shinsa who placed it mid-Muromachi.  My\nfriend who now owns the Gassan saw all the illustrations in the catalogue\nand of course asked me about it, but I haven&#39;t a clue.  Can someone who\nreads Japanese explain the importance of illustrating the many Hojo and\nGassan examples?\n\n  Ron\n  STL\n\n  Arnold wrote:\n\n  Hi:\n    I recently got back from Japan and while there found a copy of the new\n  catalog from the Sano Museum in Shizuoka. It is titled An Early Style of A\n  Japanese Sword: a search for the origin of the curve. It is 9 x 12, 140\n  pp, and covers 59 different types of swords from five warabite-to, through\n  the koto era with most being Heian, Kamakura and Nanbokucho. Each is\n  illustrated with excellent photographs of the entire blade, monouchi and\n  nakago, and oshigata too of each blade.\n  Nothing is more important than shape both as a kantei starting point and\n  the one characteristic that makes Japanese swords - through its impact on\n  cutting efficiency - different from all others. I would dearly love to be\n  able to read the text, but that awaits translation. There are not less\n  than 10 Hoju swords illustrated and 10 Gassan, and the former is little\n  discussed in the literature. In that those two near-by groups account for\n  a third of the illustrations there must be some real importance to them in\n  shape determination, but I don&#39;t have a clue what it is!\n  The Sano recently did two great shows, with catalogs, one on Rai and one\n  on Soshu, but something tells me this is by far the more important catalog\n  informationally.\n  I believe Chris Bowen posted a couple of months ago that he was a source\n  for the catalog, and there are probably others.\n\n\n\n  Arnold Frenzel\n  afrenzel@...\n\n\n\n\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n        Yahoo!
