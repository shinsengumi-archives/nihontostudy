Some of the letters are correct, but others are upside down, backwards or simply made up.  Some resemble Greek letters.\n\nThis isn&#39;t Kunishige&#39;s work and the characters, whatever they are, are more &quot;freestyle&quot; than is usually seen in that type of nanban work.  A couple of the characters do resemble tensho script.  It&#39;s not one of the common nanban styles, but dote mimi examples do exist and the iron has the grainy quality seen in a lot of nanban tsuba.\n\nLate Hoan would usually be etched rather than carved.  The iron, finishing and carving don&#39;t look like Myochin, although they did make small, bold guards.  As always, seeing it in person could give a different impression.\n\nJim\n\n\n\n  All, yes, that was a responce I was puzzled by, thus I threw it out \n  there, here is another I have had and like\n\n  I believe they represent the most ancient form of Chinese characters. Oracle bone inscriptions from the \n  Shang -Zhou dynasty (2000-1000 BC)Stone drum inscriptions from the Warring states period (3rd cent. BC). \n  I have seen similar tsuba papered as later Hoan by the Fittings Museum.\n\n  I believe this tsuba may be a copy of something, there is a rather &#39;ODD&#39; feel to it, it is pretty light for it&#39;s size as well.\n\n  RIch\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
