Possibly much\nlater. There are several differences. For starters,\nthe shape of the seppa dai. The quality of the iron is\nalso an important one and probably why Jim&#39;s is dated\nas he has it. The sukashi on his is very gentle, yet\nthe iron like extra hard armor iron so the tsuba could\nbe considered either kyo-sukashi or katchushi.\n\nIn a case like yours, someone just needs to make a\njudgement call on the iron and the workmanship of the\nsukashi. \n\nCurran\n\n\n\n--- Fredrik Persson &lt;fredmans@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; Hi all,\n&gt; This post is mainly directed to Mr Gilbert but I\n&gt; thought that maybe if \n&gt; someone else would like to comment that would be\n&gt; great.\n&gt; I was browsing your lovely tsuba site and have a\n&gt; question regarding the \n&gt; last tsuba on page two of the Early Iron tsuba link.\n&gt; http://home.earthlink.net/%7Ejggilbert/oldiron2.htm\n&gt; You are writing that it&#39;s an unusual guard, does\n&gt; this mean its hard to \n&gt; kantei? How confident are you about it being a late\n&gt; Muromachi tsuba? \n&gt; Have you or someone else seen this type of tsuba\n&gt; before, maybe in books \n&gt; as for reference?\n&gt; The thing is that I have a very similar tsuba,\n&gt; almost identical, and i \n&gt; would like to have as much information about it as\n&gt; possible. Do you \n&gt; think it may be from the same era as yours or would\n&gt; mine be a later copy?\n&gt; The measurements on my tsuba are almost the same as\n&gt; yours, mine is \n&gt; slightly thicker.\n&gt; 8.0 cm H x 8.0 cm W x 0.4 cm T\n&gt; \n&gt; Please take a look at it on\n&gt; http://hem.bredband.net/odrike/Tsuba1.htm\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards\n&gt; Fredrik\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?
