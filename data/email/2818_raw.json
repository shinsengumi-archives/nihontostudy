I say this because of the distinctive tagane (kakushi-tagane) around the nakago-ana, a Tosa Myochin trait according the Sasano and others. (Sasano points this out in his original English sukashi tsuba book, pages 218-220.)\n\nNot to muddy up the waters, but an odd experience with a like-tsuba was experienced by me back in the early 1980s. In 1979 during a Chicago NTHK shinsa, Sasano papered a friend&#39;s mumei tsuba as (I believe) 2nd master Akasaka work. Later, the tsuba went to a Haynes auction where I purchased it. Bob Haynes was adamant about the tsuba &quot;looking like&quot; Akasaka, but that in reality it was Tosa Myochi. His argument was based largely on these &quot;wisker-like&quot; kakushi-tagane that were place around the tsuba&#39;s nakago-ana. I sold that tsuba a year or two ago and passed on this story along with the original NTHK paper declaring it Akasaka. Either way, it remains a fine tsuba! \n\nRon\nSTL\n\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: Richard Turner \n  To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Sunday, April 17, 2005 6:54 PM\n  Subject: [nihontostudy] Akasaka tsuba\n\n\n  All, just thought I&#39;d share my two latest purchases.\n\n  This first one is reported to be the 4th Akasaka Tadatoki. There is an \n  almost identical one in the\n  book &#39; Akasaka Tsuba &#39; on page 34. It could be one of his students work \n  I guess.\n\n  http://img167.auctions.yahoo.co.jp/users/7/4/5/7/fmm48822-img512x472-11123447020881-y-1.jpg\n\n  http://img167.auctions.yahoo.co.jp/users/7/4/5/7/fmm48822-img472x354-11123447260881-y-3.jpg\n\n  This next one, signed Bushu Jinun Akasaka Tadatoki - Seitetsu wo motte \n  kore wo kitaeru. ( &quot;forged with refined (pure) iron.&quot; )\n  I think is the 6th Tadatoki ( my guess anyway ), maybe the 5th on a \n  scrape but the 7th is a possibility as well.\n\n  &gt; http://img123.auctions.yahoo.co.jp/users/7/4/5/7/fmm48822-img591x512-11131288702197-y-1.jpg\n\n  http://img123.auctions.yahoo.co.jp/users/7/4/5/7/fmm48822-img591x512-11131288832197-y-2.jpg\n\n  any thought&#39;s or comments aprreciated.\n\n  Rich\n\n\n\n\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  Yahoo!
