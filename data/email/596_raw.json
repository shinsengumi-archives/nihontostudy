Japanese swords\n&gt; are polished and restored, American guns are left as is, cars are taken\n&gt; apart and rebuilt, sometimes even to the chalk or cryon marks used in\n&gt; assembly.  I would think the venue as far as restoration of Japanese\nswords,\n&gt; including removal of false signatures, would largely be determined by the\n&gt; Japanese.  A sort of &quot;Render to Ceasar&quot; type of thing.  Of course, I could\n&gt; be wrong.\n&gt; Ganbatte!\n&gt; Afu\n&gt; afu@...\n&gt; For books in English on Nihon Tï¿½, go to:\n&gt; http://www.afuresearch.com\n&gt; ----- Original Message -----\n&gt; From: &quot;fd&quot; &lt;nagamaki@...&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;token_kenkyu_kai@...&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Sunday, July 20, 2003 2:28 AM\n&gt; Subject: Re: Gimei removal and Nakago Repatination\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;      With one exception I have no problem with the point of view\nregarding\n&gt; &gt; signature removal or non-removal.  Deciding whether or not to remove a\n&gt; false\n&gt; &gt; signature is certainly up to the current caretaker of the sword.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;      To hold, however, removal of a false signature is a Japanese point\nof\n&gt; &gt; view seems to me mistaken.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;     To make the argument if the false signature is old enough to add\n&gt; &gt; material evidence to the historical value of a sword is ignoring one\n&gt; &gt; significant fact. Its a form of plagiarism! There is no choice in the\n&gt; matter\n&gt; &gt; when it comes to the Japanese authenticating a sword other than to pink\n&gt; &gt; paper such a sword unless the false signature is removed.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; fd\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ----- Original Message -----\n&gt; &gt; From: &quot;David Zincavage&quot; &lt;jdz@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt; To: &lt;token_kenkyu_kai@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Cc: &lt;nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Sent: Saturday, July 19, 2003 11:21 PM\n&gt; &gt; Subject: Re: Gimei removal and Nakago Repatination\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Personally, I think this is an area where American collectors are too\n&gt; &gt; ready\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to follow the Japanese point of view.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; If a collector of antique American furniture found a 150 year\nsignature\n&gt; &gt; &gt; falsely attributing a piece of furniture to the wrong maker, he would\n&gt; &gt; &gt; certainly take the misattribution into account in valuing the piece,\nbut\n&gt; &gt; in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; no circumstances would he remove that old signature.  In his eyes, the\n&gt; &gt; false\n&gt; &gt; &gt; old signature had been part of the piece long enough to become part of\n&gt; its\n&gt; &gt; &gt; history, not perhaps the best part, but a part of some interest\n&gt; providing\n&gt; &gt; a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; piece of historical information which one would not simply discard or\n&gt; &gt; &gt; destroy.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; In Nihonto, we even have the case of gimei Muramasa blades, where\n&gt; &gt; signatures\n&gt; &gt; &gt; were altered or changed when the legend of blades by that maker and\nhis\n&gt; &gt; &gt; school and their ill-luck for members of the Tokugawa family caused\n&gt; &gt; &gt; possession of Muramasa swords to be banned.  It seems a real crime\n&gt; against\n&gt; &gt; &gt; history simply to eradicate a feature so historically evocative as\nthis\n&gt; &gt; &gt; particular sort of gimei, and I would dispense with papers myself\nrather\n&gt; &gt; &gt; than remove such a false signature.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; David\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"
