Wouldn&#39;t the judges be fairly good at\ndetection and the piece&#39;s score would be negatively\nimpacted by such a discovery?  One for Jim G. to\nanswer?\n\nGetting ivory is simple, look on ebay.  I found lots\nof piano keys listed if I remember correctly, although\nI purchased a lot of broken ivory pieces.  The netsuke\nthat came in the lot had a great red inplanted\nsignature, too bad the head was cut off.  I traded it\nfor some repro menuki, that are nice quality but I\ndon&#39;t know what to do with them at the moment.  I\nfigured better than a netsuke with no head.\n\nJim G&#39;s input on what is acceptable for papers would\nbe interesting.  \n\nKen \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?
