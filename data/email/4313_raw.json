This does not contain a complete version of the design book.\n\nI have three different hand-copied versions of the Yagyu design book, two of which are just photocopies.  I have the originals of Bob Haynes&#39; own hand copy work from which I have made high resolution scans.  I have Bob&#39;s permission to publish these, but haven&#39;t decided on print or electronic distribution.\n\nI haven&#39;t heard anything recently about the rumored Furuya book.\n\nWishing the Americans a great Independence Day tomorrow.\n\nJim \n\n\n\n\n\n  Peter & Rich,\n\n  There are the 35 or so illustrated in the Owari\n  Tosan&lt;do?&gt; no Tsuba book. Pardon my Japanese. I&#39;m sure\n  I just butchered the title.\n\n  I think there was discussion at one point of over 128\n  in print Yagyu designs, though the number may have\n  been higher. Jim Gilbert and Hans of the European\n  NBTHK society are the best to ask for the extended\n  list.\n\n  The rumor mill has made mention of a pending &lt;2006 or\n  2007&gt; Yagyu tsuba publication, and Rev. Kensho Furuya\n  made mention of a pending 2006? Yagyu book while he\n  was a member of the NMB. I am not sure this isn&#39;t the\n  same rumor from differnet angles, but I look forward\n  to any publication on Yagyu tsuba beyond the limits of\n  current reference. I greatly appreciated Jim G&#39;s\n  lecture in San Fran last year.\n\n  Curran\n\n  --- Rich Turner &lt;ikkanshi@...&gt; wrote:\n\n  &gt; I too would be interested in this.\n  &gt; \n  &gt; Cheers\n  &gt; \n  &gt; Richard\n  &gt; \n  &gt; Richard Turner\n  &gt; Nihont\u001b$B!&\u001b(BMessage Board\n  &gt; &lt;http://www.nihontomessageboard.com/nmb&gt;\n  &gt; - /for the discussion and sharing of all things\n  &gt; Nihont\u001b$B!&\u001b(B\n  &gt; \n  &gt; \n  &gt; \n  &gt; \n  &gt; \n  &gt; klepet33319 wrote:\n  &gt; &gt;\n  &gt; &gt; Does anyone know if it is possible to acquire a\n  &gt; copy of the Yagyu\n  &gt; &gt; Family Design Book?
