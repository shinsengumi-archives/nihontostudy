I&#39;ve placed four swords on consignment with Danny Massey. Check out www.nihontocraft.com  and have a look. Swords are: nidai Tsuda Sukehiro, ko-Uda, Echizen Kanenori and a mumei Seki Kanenori. \n\nI&#39;ve asked Danny to lower prices on my things as a LIMITED TIME HOLIDAY SALE in hopes of stimulating some buying interest. Just trying to reimburse some sword funding folks. Take a look and maybe you&#39;ll be tempted to put another package under your tree! \n\nQuestions? All sword sales will go through Danny but I&#39;m happy to answer any questions you might have regarding my items. Privately, off-list please at: swords@... \n\nBOOKS - My intentions of working up an illustrated listing of a dozen or so titles I&#39;ve got for sale has not yet materialize. However, if anyone is looking for something to add to their library, email me privately off-list and I&#39;ll at least send you my list of titles and prices. Of these titles, I still have ~20 copies of the Kokusai Tosogu Kai (KTK) 2008 4th International Convention publications available at $90 pp (U.S.)  Books can be shipped in time for Christmas to a U.S. address. For a listing, email me OFF-LIST at: swords@... \n\nSorry for the lengthy marketing email but it gets the word out. \n\nRon\nSTL\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
