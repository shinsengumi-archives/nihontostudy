I don&#39;t \n  need to read more books. As a member of the NTHK&#39;s shinsa team here in Tokyo \n  and a director of the NTHK, I would say that I am in a bit better position to know. If \n  that sword were submitted for shinsa, it would fail as not being Japanese.\n\n  Gordon\n\n\n   \n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n  No virus found in this incoming message.\n  Checked by AVG - http://www.avg.com \n  Version: 8.0.176 / Virus Database: 270.9.11/1819 - Release Date: 29-11-2008 10:37\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
