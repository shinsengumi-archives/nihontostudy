The\nheads of the rivet were decorated and eventually became the menuki we know\ntoday.  What I did not know until these emails is that some menuki have\n&quot;interlocking pins&quot; to become mekugi.  Sure, I&#39;ve seen these on cheap Meiji\npieces, especially tanto, but didn&#39;t know early Goto menuki had the same\nfeature.  We can clearly see that as the Nihonto developed from earliest times\nthe disadvantage of a fixed rivet became evident, but the early menuki discussed\nappear to have still functioned as a mekugi, only later becoming separate with a\nbamboo mekugi, or mekugi of other material (iron??).  I also remember that in\nthe Momoyama period a single menuki was used, accounting for some of the\n&quot;orphans&quot; we see.  Looking back over my collecting career I think I once had a\nsingle (i.e., never a pair) shakudo menuki of a pomegranate.  It was of that\nreally dark black shakudo.  Sometimes knowledge comes too late to save us from\nourselves!!!\n\nKen, I do have somewhere a late 19th century English treatise on the Goto\nmainline (Shirobei 17 generations) with photos, but it doesn&#39;t go into the\n&quot;secret marks&quot;...  Does anyone know the title of the Japanese one that Ken\nmentions??\n\nRegards,\n\nBarry Thomas.\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &quot;Kenneth Wilson&quot; &lt;kdw21620@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Sunday, May 28, 2006 12:34 AM\nSubject: Re: [nihontostudy] Menuki Posts\n\n\nYes, I believe that at one point the menuki where\n&quot;interlocking&quot; with each other, at least on some\nstyles of sword mounting design.  I can&#39;t remember\nwhat I had read about it, but I think this was the\ncombo of the mekugi-ana and the menuki, but overtime\nthe menuki and peg seperated and served different\nroles.  ok I took a stab at it, now someone can\ncorrect what I said.  Would love an english\ntranslation  of the 17 generations of goto (can&#39;t\nremember japanese tittle) in which all the secret\nmarks are revealed.\nKen\n\n--- klepet33319 &lt;Ppeterdds@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; Hello all.  I am doing some research into Goto\n&gt; School and I noticed\n&gt; that on early menuki often the posts are different\n&gt; -- one is open ended\n&gt; and the other closed over.  Does anyone know the\n&gt; reason for this?  I am\n&gt; wondering if they were actually used for mekugi and\n&gt; the one projection\n&gt; has been shortened having interlocked with the other\n&gt; originally.\n&gt; Thanks much!\n\n"
