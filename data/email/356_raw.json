Simply because the blade is diminutive \n&gt; doesn&#39;t connect it to a woman, the koshirae would be the clue for \n&gt; deducing who used it.\n&gt; \tMamorigatana as a wedding gift was part of samurai culture \n&gt; that enjoyed a brief fad in the Meiji period because the Emperor \n&gt; adopted it (the influence of his evil samurai handlers...)\n&gt; \tMy father-in-law has one for my wife but because it is such \na \n&gt; sweet sword he has yet to give it to her, we&#39;ve been married six \n&gt; years!?!\n&gt; \tRon, that is one sweet tanto you have there. Has it been \n&gt; papered? That koshirae deserves to be published. Would love to see \n&gt; that in person some day...\n&gt; -t\n\n\n"
