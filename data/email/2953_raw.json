So=\r\nmetimes a terrific tsuba is found that has been buffed or whatever and then=\r\n, repatination can be done to save it. Skip Holbrook used to do this but to=\r\nday--if I understand things correctly--only handles really high quality tsu=\r\nba. We all experiement with repatination I&#39;m sure, but care must be taken n=\r\not to (further) damage an important quality tsuba. \n\nSeveral years ago a Ja=\r\npanese  gentleman (artist) was at one of the sword shows displaying his pri=\r\nze-winning newly made tsuba. His tsuba were traditionally made and quite be=\r\natufiul...and quite expensive! So there are those around today who continue=\r\n the craft.\n\nRon\nSTL\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: Richard Turner=\r\n \n  To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Thursday, May 12, 2005 4:57 A=\r\nM\n  Subject: Re: [nihontostudy] here&#39;s probably a really stupid question\n\n\n=\r\n  LOL, sorry mate, I wasn&#39;t asking if I COULD DO IT, but rather, are there =\r\n\n  any professionals in Japan doing this sort of thing.\n\n  We would not exp=\r\nect you to be able to restore tsuba LOL.\n\n  Rich\n\n  Barry Thomas wrote:\n\n  =\r\n&gt; I&#39;m no expert by any means (&quot;X&quot; =3D an unknown factor and &quot;spurt&quot; is a \n =\r\n &gt; drip under pressure!!!), but when Trickie writes:\n  &gt;\n  &gt; &gt; My question =\r\nfor the day then is, if we polish and restore pittings,\n  &gt; &gt; scratches, ch=\r\nips and the likes from swords, is anything like this\n  &gt; &gt; ever done on iro=\r\nn tsuba ?\n  &gt;\n  &gt; my answer would be\n  &gt;\n  &gt; NOooooooo...\n  &gt;\n  &gt; How do I =\r\nknow??
