I recall seeing these over the years, but\nnever had a term for them until Fuller and Gregory published a couple of\npages about them in their first volume on &quot;Imperial swords.&quot; In that book,\nthey say - without reference - that the samurai army raised  against the\nnewly formed Imperial Army  of the Meiji government  by Saigo Takamori was\nequipped with swords that have a distinctive flat wrap and very ordinary\nkodogu. Notably, they often have simple washer style menuki.\n      There is no question that these fittings are a &quot;type&quot; that does occur\nin the real world. By that I mean that it is a fairly consistent style that\nwe do see it from time to time. It looks expedient and very\n&quot;utility-grade.&quot; But is anyone really aware of evidence that they really\nwere associated with the Satsuma Rebellion? I&#39;m wondering if they might\nsimply be very low-end koshirae produced in terminal Edo/Meiji times for\nany market there was for low-end swords. If any one has insights on this, I\nwould appreciate them. Thnak you\n      I might as well explain why I ask. I recently acquired some (about\n140 in all ) 1910 vintage photos of North Pacific ethnographic objects that\nwere being sold by a dealer. A couple of these pictures show Japanese\nswords and at least one of them certainly looks like a &quot;Rebellion sword.&quot; I\nknow the Rebellion failed, but I have a hard time believing that Saigo left\nKyushu for the Aleutians!\nPeter\n\n\n\nPeter Bleed\nAssociate Dean\nCollege of Arts and Sciences\n1223 Oldfather Hall\nUniversity of Nebraska\nLincoln, NE 68588-0312\n(402) 472-2891\n\n\n"
