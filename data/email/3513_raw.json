I \ndecided it could do with an extended vacation in the pocket, wrapped in \na nice soft cotton cloth I have. I got to thinking about what was \nactually required here as I do not do this very often, just preferring \nto leave well enough alone. A visit to Jim G&#39;s site and a read through \nhis article &quot;Cleaning Iron Tsuba \n&lt;http://home.earthlink.net/%7Ejggilbert/Cleaning.htm&gt;&quot; was required to \nsee if there was anything I needed to know besides the basics.\n\nReading through, I came across the following sentence, &quot;Lots of patience \nand tired fingers is the only way.&quot;\n\nThis got me to thinking and asking the following questions.\n\n1. How much pressure is applied generally ?, A: only a soft touch, \nlightly brushing the surface with the cloth. B: a firm touch, bring a \nlittle pressure to the surface. C: hard pressure, rubbing like a \nlunatic. The last I think would be a big no no as my main concern is \nover polishing, making the tsuba shiny and this is the last thing we \nwant to achieve.\n\n2: Is there any sort of preferred cloth. ie. cotton, silk, flannel, \ngingham ???? ( just joking on the flannel ). Has anyone tried all types \nof cloth and had varying result.\n\n3: Do people use oils ?. I have heard of Choji, skin oil ( i.e forehead, \nneck etc ) and gun oil add to lustre but I find this makes the tsuba \nlook a little artificial. Ok, to stop any active rust I understand but \nif the Hira is just a little dull and neglected then.................\n\nOk, so just something to generate some thought and discussion.\n\nCheers all.\n\nRich Turner\n \n-- \n*Richard Turner - Nihonto Message Board*\n/for the discussion of all things Nihonto./\nwww.nihontomessageboard.com &lt;http://www.nihontomessageboard.com/nmb/&gt;\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
