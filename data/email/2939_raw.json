To describe it, it is a stubby, short (4&quot;) head, 4-sided yari made with yokote. This one is quite nice and signed by Yokoyama Bizen Sukehira (shinshin-to). \n\nIn Kajihara&#39;s glossery (p.250) illustrates what I would say is that shape/form, but a number of names are given for it: tanpo yari, te yari, ko-yari, kago yari, mijika-yari. \n\nThe mijika-yari elaborates, saying &quot;short, straight yari of 3 to 6 sun.&quot; This sounds like what my yari would be but then the other types are simply identified by a name (which I can not translate, other than the ko-yari). Any answer to this?\n\nCan anyone comment on Knutsen&#39;s latest publication on pole arms, if it is useful...cost and sources? I&#39;ve yet to buy a copy and have already forgotten the name of this latest Knutsen publication. \n\nRon\nSTL\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
