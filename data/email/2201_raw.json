If its got problems, see below...\n\nthe deadly enemy of iron tsuba is red rust - if your piece has this on \nit, its a problem.  somehow you have to\nget this off - some people use horn, but I&#39;ve found that ivory seems to \nbe really good for use to scrape this off\nwhile not harming the the brown rust (I think Jim Gilbert has an \nexcellent article on this in a couple of\nplaces on line...).  - often you have to work at it quite a bit - I \nsometimes alternate scraping sessions with\nwashing the piece in warm water with a mild soap and a soft \ntoothbrush...  And again, you only want to\ndo this ONLY on the outside surfaces of the tsuba, not down in the sukashi.\n\nAfter you&#39;ve done that, the revealed old rust regions are often pretty \ngnarly, or if the piece is just plain &quot;rough&quot;,\nyou can &quot;pocket polish&quot; the piece - just carry it around\nin your pocket for a few weeks (NOT where you carry your keys/change) - \nthis gives the piece a nice rubbed look that\nis hard to get by just marathon rubbing sessions with a cloth...\n\nWhen you&#39;re buying tsuba, always be on the lookout for pieces that have \nbeen &quot;primped&quot; like this - you&#39;ll see\npeople that hide a multitude of sins with various waxes, oils, PAINT (I \ngot a couple like this - the guy color\nmatched the patina and jammed the tsuba (!!) - looked real darned good, \ntoo - I was quite happy until I tried to clean\nup a rough spot I thought was oil, used some enamel thinner, and - \nsurprise!...), etc.,.  I&#39;d like to think they\njust wanted the pieces to look better/didn&#39;t know any better and really \nweren&#39;t thinking fraudulent thoughts, but....\n\nGood Luck,\n\nrkg\n(Richard George)\n\n&gt;Milt,\n&gt;\n&gt;Jinsoo Kim told me that the best way to care for the old iron \n&gt;sukashi pieces I have is to simply rub them now and then with a soft \n&gt;silk cloth.  I have read the various prescriptions for cleaning, \n&gt;waxing, etc... and, as I&#39;ve mentioned, I am quite the novice and so \n&gt;am in the dark as to what the current thinking on this is.  The \n&gt;tsuba I have are all in excellent condition, with only minimal spots \n&gt;of light surface rust in some of the sukashi openings, and none on \n&gt;the plate or rim.  Again, I appreciate your thoughts on this, and am \n&gt;gradually coming to a view that if I&#39;m in doubt, do nothing!  \n&gt;\n&gt;Thanks again,\n&gt;\n&gt;Steve\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;Yahoo!
