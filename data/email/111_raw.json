(this would be a good spot to use that G3\n :-) ).  This is interesting - I wonder if there are so few pieces \nbecause they got &quot;used up&quot; (like most of the early yari/naginata),\nremade into something else, or were simply not &quot;worthy of preservation&quot;. \n They did appear longer than sun nobi tanto, right?\n\nI&#39;ve always wondered if the footsoldier types would  normally carry a \nfull length sword in additon to a polearm - seems\nlike it would kind of get in the way...\n\nAnd speaking of polearms, have you seen many &quot;original&quot; polearm koshirae \nfrom this period?  I was kind of wondering about\nthe presence, size, etc, or tsuba and/or &quot;catchers&quot; on the yari/naginata \nof the period. (I think I&#39;ve only seen a couple\n(the ones that are in &quot;all&quot; the books - as usual, the few examples the \nowners let anybody see)).\n\nThanks,\n\nrkg\n(Richard George)\n\n&gt;I happened to visit the Metropolitan Museum of Art today to see their new show &quot;Great Waves, Chinese Themes in the Art of Korea and Japan.&quot;  While not a particularly successful show, there are some very good paintings, including an interesting set of newly acquired handscrolls from the Nanbokucho period on display that included some apparently accurate battle sequences.  \n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n"
