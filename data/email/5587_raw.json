Ko Kinko are\n&gt; &gt; the main culprits. Man=\r\ny of them are held together with two little\n&gt; &gt; rivets, the fukurin is more=\r\n to finish off the the tsuba aesthetically.\n&gt; &gt; See here (thanks Baz)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; http://www.nihonto-bijutsubu.com/personal/ko-kinko.jpg\n&gt; &gt; http://www.ni=\r\nhonto-bijutsubu.com/personal/ko-kinko-sanmai.jpg\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The tsuba you are =\r\nreferring to as Sanmai, probably is Ko Kinko, but I\n&gt; &gt; guess we would need=\r\n to see it to be able to make a call like that.\n&gt; &gt; Kagami shi (kagami =3D =\r\nmirror, shi =3D maker) usually made tsuba that were\n&gt; &gt; cast from bronze or=\r\n yamagane. I have not seen any sanmei kagamishi\n&gt; &gt; tsuba but that does not=\r\n mean there were not any. I will have a look in\n&gt; &gt; Sasano&#39;s little book to=\r\nnight at home and see if there is any reference.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; This is a typical =\r\nKagami-shi tsuba\n&gt; &gt; http://richardturner.wordpress.com/2009/01/17/130/\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; Most likely, all 3 tsuba you have are Ko Kinko.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Cheers\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n Richard\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; __,_._\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Elliot, and all,\n&gt; \n&gt; Richard i=\r\ns spot-on in his observations, of course.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m thinking that it&#39;s worth=\r\n noting that &quot;Ko-Kinko&quot; can tend to be a big box\n&gt; in which to sort anythin=\r\ng old (Ko) made of soft metal (Kinko) rather than\n&gt; iron. So the materials =\r\ncan cover the gamut from brass, bronze, yamagane\n&gt; (&quot;impure&quot; copper), more =\r\nrefined copper, and even shakudo, and the techniques\n&gt; can range from cast,=\r\n forged, sanmai, various surface treatments, zogan, etc.\n&gt; Some pieces can =\r\nbe easily classified by &quot;school&quot; in the roughest sense of\n&gt; the word - cast=\r\n guards are invariably &quot;Kagamishi&quot; - and somewhat more\n&gt; decorated guards l=\r\nike your sanmai get called &quot;Ko-Kinko&quot; like they are some\n&gt; pre-Kinko (fancy=\r\n) guards. In fact some get further classified as Ko-Goto or\n&gt; Ko-Mino when =\r\nthey look like the antecedent of those well defined schools\n&gt; that fully fl=\r\nower as we move closer to Edo period.\n&gt; \n&gt; My own recent area of interest h=\r\nas been &quot;tachikanagushi&quot; guards which are\n&gt; soft metal thought (by some) to=\r\n be made by tachi makers who also made\n&gt; fittings to go with the blades the=\r\ny made, which is (I think) an interesting\n&gt; speculation without much empiri=\r\ncal evidence. In any case you can see much of\n&gt; that collection on Boris Ma=\r\nrkhasin&#39;s website, on the consignment page, at\n&gt; yamabushiantiques.com.\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; Sometimes I think the semantics and classification get in the way of simp=\r\nle\n&gt; enjoyment of beautiful art objects, but I approach this study more fro=\r\nm an\n&gt; art angle.\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; \n&gt; Craig\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; ,___\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; PS The little =\r\nSasano book Richard refers to is a gem, part of a series of\n&gt; three that Sa=\r\nsano did on old soft metal guards, and worth keeping an eye out\n&gt; for.\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; \n&gt; -- \n&gt; Craig Harris\n&gt; Bridge of Dreams, LLC\n&gt; Books from and about As=\r\nia\n&gt; www.bridgeofdreams.com\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have=\r\n been removed]\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"
