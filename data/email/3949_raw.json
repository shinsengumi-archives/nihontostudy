I plan to update the photos on my site and will include images of rims where there is something to see.  Given storage and bandwidth limitations I will probably have to get rid of the pieces that I don&#39;t have any longer so that I can focus on the best examples.  \n\nThe technical aspects of tekkotsu are far from settled.  The quote that Pete posted from the Solingen catalog is an interesting one.  I don&#39;t know whether that is how tekkotsu were formed in the Muromachi period.  I have read hypotheses crediting everything from the source of the ore onward for being the cause of tekkotsu.  There is even an idea that the bones were not even visible in the original piece but are only revealed over time due to the corrosion and/or wear resistance of the higher carbon regions.  I doubt that that&#39;s entirely true, but it is a factor for guards with condition problems -- the tekkotsu will stand out.\n\nJim\n\n\n\n  Jim,\n\n  Excellent, while of course I would love to handle\n  them,  these pictures are the next best thing.  Great\n  stuff and makes it clearer.  If someone had the time,\n  it would be great to put these up on your/someone&#39;s\n  website.  All these sites devoted to swords, could use\n  some more to tsuba.  Would love to see tekkotsu\n  website depicting various schools.\n\n  Now for the next question- why so different?  metal\n  used? folding techniques?  when forming the mimi what\n  steps would they do (I know big questions)?\n\n  Thanks- as always you are extremely helpful.\n  Ken\n  &#92;\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
