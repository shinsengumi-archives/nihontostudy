The\n&gt; heads of the rivet were decorated and eventually became the menuki we know\n&gt; today.  What I did not know until these emails is that some menuki have\n&gt; &quot;interlocking pins&quot; to become mekugi.  Sure, I&#39;ve seen these on cheap\n&gt; Meiji\n&gt; pieces, especially tanto, but didn&#39;t know early Goto menuki had the same\n&gt; feature.  We can clearly see that as the Nihonto developed from earliest\n&gt; times\n&gt; the disadvantage of a fixed rivet became evident, but the early menuki\n&gt; discussed\n&gt; appear to have still functioned as a mekugi, only later becoming separate\n&gt; with a\n&gt; bamboo mekugi, or mekugi of other material (iron??).  I also remember that\n&gt; in\n&gt; the Momoyama period a single menuki was used, accounting for some of the\n&gt; &quot;orphans&quot; we see.  Looking back over my collecting career I think I once\n&gt; had a\n&gt; single (i.e., never a pair) shakudo menuki of a pomegranate.  It was of\n&gt; that\n&gt; really dark black shakudo.  Sometimes knowledge comes too late to save us\n&gt; from\n&gt; ourselves!!!\n&gt;\n&gt; Ken, I do have somewhere a late 19th century English treatise on the Goto\n&gt; mainline (Shirobei 17 generations) with photos, but it doesn&#39;t go into the\n&gt; &quot;secret marks&quot;...  Does anyone know the title of the Japanese one that Ken\n&gt; mentions??\n&gt;\n&gt; Regards,\n&gt;\n&gt; Barry Thomas.\n&gt;\n&gt; ----- Original Message -----\n&gt; From: &quot;Kenneth Wilson&quot; &lt;kdw21620@...&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Sunday, May 28, 2006 12:34 AM\n&gt; Subject: Re: [nihontostudy] Menuki Posts\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yes, I believe that at one point the menuki where\n&gt; &quot;interlocking&quot; with each other, at least on some\n&gt; styles of sword mounting design.  I can&#39;t remember\n&gt; what I had read about it, but I think this was the\n&gt; combo of the mekugi-ana and the menuki, but overtime\n&gt; the menuki and peg seperated and served different\n&gt; roles.  ok I took a stab at it, now someone can\n&gt; correct what I said.  Would love an english\n&gt; translation  of the 17 generations of goto (can&#39;t\n&gt; remember japanese tittle) in which all the secret\n&gt; marks are revealed.\n&gt; Ken\n&gt;\n&gt; --- klepet33319 &lt;Ppeterdds@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hello all.  I am doing some research into Goto\n&gt; &gt; School and I noticed\n&gt; &gt; that on early menuki often the posts are different\n&gt; &gt; -- one is open ended\n&gt; &gt; and the other closed over.  Does anyone know the\n&gt; &gt; reason for this?  I am\n&gt; &gt; wondering if they were actually used for mekugi and\n&gt; &gt; the one projection\n&gt; &gt; has been shortened having interlocked with the other\n&gt; &gt; originally.\n&gt; &gt; Thanks much!\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
