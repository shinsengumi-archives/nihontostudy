I am familiar with them as\n&gt; written up on page 58-5=\r\n9 of Harry Watson&#39;s Nihonto\n&gt; Koza translation of Kodogu Part 1.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ve =\r\nseen a limited number of these over the years,\n&gt; and they are distinct enou=\r\ngh to me that I feel they\n&gt; constitute a distinct _if minor_ school.\n&gt; \n&gt; Q=\r\n1:  Has anyone ever seen a tsuba NBTHK / NTHK papered\n&gt; to Tochibata?\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nQ2:  Can anyone point me to further writing on this\n&gt; school?\n&gt; \n&gt; They ten=\r\nd to be strong solid open tsuba that remind of\n&gt; Owari, are thick, yet very=\r\n clean. The last I saw was\n&gt; identical to the one on the bottom of NihontoK=\r\noza pg.\n&gt; 59 and sold as &quot;Owari&quot;.  I suspect the papering\n&gt; authorities jus=\r\nt designate them &quot;Owari&quot;, but hope to\n&gt; find an either one papered Tochibat=\r\na or hope to find\n&gt; another source beyond the Nihonto Koza.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks in =\r\nadvance,\n&gt; \n&gt; Curran\n&gt; \n&gt;there is a tsuba attributed as such in one of the =\r\nJapanese museum \ncatalog ( the one Richie Turner bought in Japan and have t=\r\no carried \nback to ozzieland ), page 23, #74, it has a rope mimi\n\nmilt\n\n\n"
