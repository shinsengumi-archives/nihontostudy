To find a stiffer\ndeer one would have to go to the tundra...\n\nI recall well a tsuba that I found many years ago.  It was a small, copper\nsanmai awase (if I correctly remember a phrase I haven&#39;t uttered for 15 or more\nyears!) with a touch of silver (tin??) showing stylised (stamped?) waves with a\ncreature on it that I always thought was an &quot;over-endowed rabbit&quot;, but Bob\nHaynes told me was a fox!!  I wrote to Bob when I saw a similar tsuba in one of\nhis catalogues.  I was amazed when he said this was a very early style of tsuba\nca 1300 - 1400.  I had it for years, often looking at it and saying &quot;Do I like\nit, or do I not??&quot;  Same thing with this deer kinko.  I have gazed at Pete\nKlein&#39;s image on yahoo (I actually have the Lundren Collection book, but it&#39;s\nout on loan to a &#39;kinko&#39; mate) for a long time on this sleepless night, and I\nask myself the same question all over again.  So David Z, if I could ask you a\nquestion, when you say &quot;I don&#39;t collect kinko at all,  but this is one of a\nsmall number of cases which, granted a opportunity, would lead me to alter my\npolicy&quot; I have to ask you &quot;WHY??&quot;  Please explain.\n\nIf I found this very tsuba I would think it was junk.  I don&#39;t have to tell you\nwhy.  Or do I??  The design spilling into the seppadai I have only seen on tsuba\nI didn&#39;t care for.  The wobbly surface and incredibly bad nanako would kill it\nfor me.  And the stiff deer doesn&#39;t do anything for me at all.  However, I would\nlook at the larger than usual kozuka ana and opine &quot;Hmmm, maybe it&#39;s early&quot;.\nBack to my question to myself &quot;Do I like it, or do I not&quot;.  If I don&#39;t like it,\nI don&#39;t collect it, no matter what the aesthetes say.\n\nNow, this puts me into the rustic class, I know, but there is a point to this\nthat is not all derisory or derogatory.  It is this.  It is easy to pick\nexcellent work amongst Edo period tsuba , even in the iron &quot;wabi-sabi&quot; class,\nbut the archaic styles, the transition between (if we might say) conceptual\nforerunners and the refined later schools is much, much more difficult.  Or is\nit??  Recall here Milt&#39;s hawk tsuba that lead to the present discussion.  And I\ncan show you a tsuba that a well-educated (tsuba knowledge) mate of mine\ndismissed as &quot;late, possibly 1920s&quot;.  It is a masterwork of late Edo/early Meiji\nand belongs to a friend of mine.  If he gives permission I&#39;ll put up some images\nof it.\n\nSo, to bring this to a close, are there any others inhabiting the same closet as\nI???  I know I&#39;m lacking an ability, an aesthetic if you like, to appreciate the\nstiff deer kinko in question and it worries me.  It seems without thorough study\nand training many tsuba in this time frame would indeed be considered junk and\nsold off, possibly to an ignominious fate.  The other kinko that Pete shows in\ntwo images at the same link does &quot;speak to me&quot;.  It is from the same time frame\nand I find it elegant and refined and would collect it.  I think this discussion\nparallels the Sue Koto kazuuchimono line of thinking with blades - I don&#39;t\ncollect those either...\n\nBarry Thomas\n(Melbourne, Australia)\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &quot;klepet33319&quot; &lt;Ppeterdds@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Monday, April 17, 2006 5:50 AM\nSubject: [nihontostudy] Re: in defense of the ugly bird or seeking more &quot;\npunishment &quot;\n\n\nLink to scan &#39;deer&#39; tsuba from Lundgren collection:\n\n http://ph.groups.yahoo.com/group/nihontostudy/photos/view/7936?b=3\n\n"
