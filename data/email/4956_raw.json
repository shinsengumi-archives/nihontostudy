It is well-known that most signatures on kogatana are spurious, and IMHO these are no exception.  Elliot, I am sorry but it pains me to say that the characters are crudely chiselled with no finesse whatsoever.  A cursory run through my kogatana book does not reveal any examples signed in such a rudimentary manner.  I have found a Tadahiro but it is nothing like the piece under consideration.  I doubt there is much to learn from these pieces.  It always pays to bear in mind one of Albert Yamanaka&#39;s immortal sayings &quot;Looking at bad swords ruins your eye&quot;.  It is no less true for kogatana...  But as Tom says, thanks for posting Elliot.  As a counter to Albert&#39;s advice, one of my truisms has always been &quot;Look at everything&quot;...\n\nRegards,\nBarry Thomas.\n\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: Tom Helm \n  To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Wednesday, March 28, 2007 3:56 PM\n  Subject: Re: [nihontostudy] photos added to album\n\n\n  Elliott -\n  looks like quite a bit of the mei is missing but I would look at \n  Hitachi no Kami Muneshige of Settsu. Based on your photos that is my \n  best guess. I am also curious about the temper you mentioned, is it \n  only on the reverse?
