The tables were all full, unlike laste year\n&gt;&gt; when storms ba=\r\nck east prevented some from attending. There were\n&gt;&gt; several Japanese with =\r\ntables set up that had not been here in the\n&gt;&gt; recent past, Most notably Ao=\r\ni Arts. There were exceptional swords,\n&gt;&gt; and lots of average blades though=\r\n maybe not as many swords overall\n&gt;&gt; compared to last year. two things of n=\r\note were the number of Gassan\n&gt;&gt; works for sale, there were a half dozen po=\r\nlished and papered pieces\n&gt;&gt; scattered through out the show room and a real=\r\n chance to study\n&gt;&gt; Sadakazu, Sadakatsu and others. Also there were many mo=\r\nre koshirae of\n&gt;&gt; exceptional quality and interest and I enjoyed quite a bi=\r\nt of my time\n&gt;&gt; pouring over these.\n&gt;&gt; \tThe NTHK presented the Swords and F=\r\nittings of Mino Province, the\n&gt;&gt; Naginata seen below is from that exhibit. =\r\nThe NBTHK did a\n&gt;&gt; presentation of Tanto, 13 total as I recall, from Awatag=\r\nuchi Hisakuni\n&gt;&gt; to Gassan Sadakazu. The Soshu Yukimitsu tanti which was nu=\r\nmber two on\n&gt;&gt; the table was my pick for best of show. There was a Soshu Hi=\r\nromasa\n&gt;&gt; Otanto (kowakizashi) in the middle of the pack that was in an old=\r\ner\n&gt;&gt; polish which was a bit scuffed up but this did not prevent one from\n&gt;=\r\n&gt; seeing the quality, a fine example of the period and not the kind of\n&gt;&gt; k=\r\noto we usually see around here.\n&gt;&gt; \tThere was an NBTHK Kantei-kai as well. =\r\nWith a Yosozaemon Suksada\n&gt;&gt; yoroidoshi and a Kawai Hisayuki katana being t=\r\nhe stand-outs. The\n&gt;&gt; Kawai blade was presented by the First Japanese Ambas=\r\nsadors to the US\n&gt;&gt; to their American chaperone and it is still held in the=\r\n same family.\n&gt;&gt; A real treasure.\n&gt;&gt; \tI bought some books as one might expe=\r\nct, sold very few that I\n&gt;&gt; brought with me but I learned lots and enjoyed =\r\ngood company all\n&gt;&gt; weekend. I am sure we&#39;ll here more from others as they =\r\nget back to\n&gt;&gt; their homes from way out west...\n&gt;&gt; -t\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;   ----------=\r\n\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; IMG_3977.JPG\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; [Non-text portions of this message ha=\r\nve been removed]\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ___________________________________________________=\r\n______________\n&gt; See what you=92re getting into\n&gt; before you go there\n&gt; htt=\r\np://newlivehotmail.com/? \n&gt; ocid=3DTXT_TAGHM_migration_HM_viral_preview_050=\r\n7\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
