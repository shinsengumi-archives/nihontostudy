One tested sword we looked at was a Mino Ka=\r\nnemichi, the sue-koto smith and father of the famous Mishina den family of =\r\nsmiths in early shin-to times. The &quot;test&quot; is carved into the nakago -- not =\r\nkinzogan -- and is unsigned and undated. Examining the &quot;age&quot; of the test in=\r\nscription v/s Kanemichi&#39;s mei, they appear to be of the same age. This brou=\r\nght out a number of questions:The earliest known &quot;dated&quot; cutting test?Koto =\r\nera test inscriptions; has anyone read about when &quot;testing&quot; began to be ins=\r\ncribed on nakago?Is it possible that initially, test inscriptions were cut =\r\ninto the nakago informally (undated, simple statement), then became more fo=\r\nrmal (gold inlaid, tester noted and test dated) and later in shinshinto tim=\r\nes, again became simply carved statements but perhaps more complete -- date=\r\nd, at least? We see some kinzogan &quot;test inscriptions&quot; -- ones I call &quot;unoff=\r\nicial&quot; because there is not date or tester name -- possibly true cutting te=\r\nsts not but simply not performed by one of the more known &quot;tester families.=\r\n&quot; Is this correct thinking? To my limited knowledge, based one what is typi=\r\ncally found in our more common reference books, kinzogan inscriptions were =\r\na mid/late shin-to era thing. Then you read about the shinshin-to inscripti=\r\nons that are more commonly found not of kinzogan, but simply &quot;cut&quot; into the=\r\n nakago. Talking about this it seems logical that perhaps when tests were i=\r\nnitially &quot;put on a nakago&quot; that they were simply &quot;carved statements&quot; attest=\r\ning to the sword&#39;s cutting ability. Then came the fad of kinzogan tests and=\r\n families doing this task professionally. For some reason shinshin-to tests=\r\n seem to typically be without kinzogan, but still with &quot;details&quot; such as da=\r\nte and tester. The idea of &quot;transition&quot; test inscriptions came up, perhaps =\r\nas on the Kanemichi daito -- simple &quot;this cut through...&quot; -- which evolved =\r\ninto formal kinzogan tests inscriptions. If later fad ended up as in shinsh=\r\nin-to times -- inscripted in detail but not kinzogan. (Then of course the i=\r\ndea of &quot;unoffical&quot; tests mentioned earlier.) Just passing these ideas out t=\r\no the groups. I&#39;ve only seen one publication of testing -- a two-volume set=\r\n; name escapes me -- but it would seem &quot;somebody&quot; would had researched this=\r\n topic in great depth somewhere along the way.
