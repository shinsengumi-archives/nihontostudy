After the hostilities ended with Edo \nJidai emerging there was a di=\r\nspersal of the Shoami School to different \nregions of Japan with the remain=\r\ning Kyoto artisans being the Kyo-\nShoami.  (Kyo-sukashi and Heianjo-sukashi=\r\n developed in Kyoto during \nMomoyama Jidai and into Edo until they more or =\r\nless merged).  \nJust a note -- the tsuba of Petter could also very well be =\r\nBizen Shoami \nas they had similar styles with the Kyo-Shoami in sukashi and=\r\n nunome.  \nDr. Torigoye mentioned the mimi thickness was a delineating poin=\r\nt of \nreference, the Bizen being slightly thicker.  I am not certain if thi=\r\ns \nstyle was used in the Ko-Shoami but a note of interest is that the gold =\r\n\nnunome of the older pieces apparently was accomplished with greater \nskill=\r\n so that pieces of greater age often have more of the nunome left \nas oppos=\r\ned to the later Edo school pieces.\n(OK -- did I get that right, Jim?)(BIG L=\r\nOL)\n\n\n\n\n"
