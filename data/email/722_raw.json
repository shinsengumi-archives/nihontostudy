The lawf=\r\nul use and possession of a &quot;prohibited\n&gt; =A0 weapon&quot; requires an Approval f=\r\nrom the Chief Commissioner of Police \n&gt; (for\n&gt; =A0 which a fee is charged).=\r\n Persons may be exempted from this \n&gt; requirement\n&gt; =A0 by the Governor-in-=\r\nCouncil. A person, therefore, under the proposed\n&gt; =A0 Regulations, could s=\r\ntill lawfully own and possess a sword if, for\n&gt; =A0 example, they obtained =\r\nan Approval to do so from the Chief \n&gt; Commissioner\n&gt; =A0 of Police.\n&gt;\n&gt; =\r\n=A0 The proposed Regulations will not necessitate destruction of swords. \n&gt;=\r\n In\n&gt; =A0 the event that the proposed Regulations come into operation, pers=\r\nons \n&gt; in\n&gt; =A0 possession of a sword who do not obtain an Approval from th=\r\ne Chief\n&gt; =A0 Commissioner of Police and who do not fall under an exemption=\r\n \n&gt; granted by\n&gt; =A0 the Governor-in-Council could dispose of their weapons=\r\n through, for\n&gt; =A0 example, an authorised weapons trader.\n&gt;\n&gt; =A0 The Regu=\r\nlatory Impact Statement (RIS) which assesses the impact of \n&gt; the\n&gt; =A0 pro=\r\nposed Regulations has been publicly released and I attach a copy \n&gt; of\n&gt; =\r\n=A0 the RIS for your information. Should you wish to make a further\n&gt; =A0 s=\r\nubmission on the proposed Regulations after reading the RIS (the\n&gt; =A0 prop=\r\nosed Regulations themselves are at Attachment 1 to the RIS) you\n&gt; =A0 would=\r\n be most welcome to do so. The closing date for submissions is\n&gt; =A0 Monday=\r\n 8 September 2003. Details on how to make a submission can be\n&gt; =A0 found i=\r\nn the RIS.\n&gt;\n&gt; =A0 Further copies of the Regulatory Impact Statement can be=\r\n accessed on \n&gt; the\n&gt; =A0 internet at www.justice.vic.gov.au\n&gt;\n&gt; =A0 Thank =\r\nyou for raising your views with the Department of Justice.\n&gt;\n&gt; =A0 Yours si=\r\nncerely\n&gt;\n&gt; =A0 Signed\n&gt;\n&gt; =A0 Marisa De Cicco\n&gt; =A0 Director, Justice Poli=\r\ncy\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; =A0 (See attached file: Control of Weapons - Firearms Regulatory I=\r\nmpact\n&gt; =A0 Statement.pdf)\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; =A0 ____=\r\n_____________________________________\n&gt; =A0 ***CONFIDENTIAL***\n&gt; =A0 The in=\r\nformation in this message and in any attachments may be\n&gt; =A0 confidential.=\r\n If you are not the intended recipient of this message, \n&gt; you\n&gt; =A0 must n=\r\not read, forward, print, copy, disclose, or use in any way the\n&gt; =A0 inform=\r\nation this message or any attachment contains.
