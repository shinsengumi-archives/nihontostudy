Its a pretty \n&gt; crappy tsuba I&#39;m holding in my hand. Late 20th\n&gt; century is surprising \n&gt; though, but offcourse possible.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks for making things clear..:)\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards\n&gt; Fredrik\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Curran Campbell wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;Fredrik,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;I&#39;ll stick my neck out first.\n&gt; &gt;   I&#39;d say same design, later copy. Possibly much\n&gt; &gt;later. There are several differences. For starters,\n&gt; &gt;the shape of the seppa dai. The quality of the iron\n&gt; is\n&gt; &gt;also an important one and probably why Jim&#39;s is\n&gt; dated\n&gt; &gt;as he has it. The sukashi on his is very gentle,\n&gt; yet\n&gt; &gt;the iron like extra hard armor iron so the tsuba\n&gt; could\n&gt; &gt;be considered either kyo-sukashi or katchushi.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;In a case like yours, someone just needs to make a\n&gt; &gt;judgement call on the iron and the workmanship of\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt;sukashi. \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Curran\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;--- Fredrik Persson &lt;fredmans@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Hi all,\n&gt; &gt;&gt;This post is mainly directed to Mr Gilbert but I\n&gt; &gt;&gt;thought that maybe if \n&gt; &gt;&gt;someone else would like to comment that would be\n&gt; &gt;&gt;great.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;I was browsing your lovely tsuba site and have a\n&gt; &gt;&gt;question regarding the \n&gt; &gt;&gt;last tsuba on page two of the Early Iron tsuba\n&gt; link.\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;http://home.earthlink.net/%7Ejggilbert/oldiron2.htm\n&gt; &gt;&gt;You are writing that it&#39;s an unusual guard, does\n&gt; &gt;&gt;this mean its hard to \n&gt; &gt;&gt;kantei? How confident are you about it being a\n&gt; late\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Muromachi tsuba? \n&gt; &gt;&gt;Have you or someone else seen this type of tsuba\n&gt; &gt;&gt;before, maybe in books \n&gt; &gt;&gt;as for reference?\n&gt; &gt;&gt;The thing is that I have a very similar tsuba,\n&gt; &gt;&gt;almost identical, and i \n&gt; &gt;&gt;would like to have as much information about it as\n&gt; &gt;&gt;possible. Do you \n&gt; &gt;&gt;think it may be from the same era as yours or\n&gt; would\n&gt; &gt;&gt;mine be a later copy?\n&gt; &gt;&gt;The measurements on my tsuba are almost the same\n&gt; as\n&gt; &gt;&gt;yours, mine is \n&gt; &gt;&gt;slightly thicker.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;8.0 cm H x 8.0 cm W x 0.4 cm T\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Please take a look at it on\n&gt; &gt;&gt;http://hem.bredband.net/odrike/Tsuba1.htm\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Regards\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Fredrik\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;    \n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;__________________________________________________\n&gt; &gt;Do You Yahoo!?\n&gt; &gt;Tired of spam?
