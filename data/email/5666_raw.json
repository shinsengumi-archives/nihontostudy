An email was received today announcing that Dean Hartley died yesterday. Also in today&#39;s mail, the NCJSC newsletter announced the death of Bill Edick last week. \n\nBill, a super nice gentleman, was one of my first acquaintances when I entered the sword world. It was always so neat to see Bill and his son Jack together at the San Francisco shows. Bill continued to have a table full of &quot;goodies&quot; -- remember those wonderful abumi he displayed? -- at the show and always had a smile and a good word to share with everyone. \n\nIt seems like Dean was always there, a fixture of the sword scene and another old friend from those early days of studying swords. Dean&#39;s exposure to and knowledge of swords was an inspiration to me personally, a goal to strive for. \n\nI&#39;m sure more tributes will be written to remember these two founders. For now, I feel sad to learn of their passing and will sit and recall the many fond memories of my friendship with them. Condolences to their families...\nRon\nSTL\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
