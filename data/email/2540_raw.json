The leaves are quite different from ones in an aoi mon and again the flowers don&#39;t match the ones on the bowl.  \n\nThe plant in the aoi mon is often called hollyhock in English, but that&#39;s yet another very different group of plants.  Working with the common names of plants is confusing enough without dealing with approximate translations, too.  Agreed that the vines don&#39;t belong to the leaves/mon.    \n\nJim\n\n\n\n  Sorry, I just read Jim&#39;s discussion, but I think the plant used for the\n  Tokugawa mon and that on this bowl is the tachi-aoe or hollyhock. Also, the\n  vines and what not, are not tachi-aoe elements, but closer to karakusa or\n  arabesques/foliage and are often found in lacquered pieces. I have a\n  naginata pole with the same arabesques and mon (different mon). \n\n\n\n  Gordon\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
