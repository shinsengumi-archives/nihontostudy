Sometimes people \n&gt; speak/write without thought or res=\r\nearch and may be forgiven, but, \n&gt; rudeness never. I hope you don&#39;t let it =\r\nget to you. I asked in an \n&gt; earlier post for ID and was ignored and that l=\r\neaves me cold. \n&gt; The &quot;Unknown Polisher&quot;?

As a member of the NTHK&#39;s shinsa team \nhere \n&gt; in Toky=\r\no \n&gt; &gt; and a director of the NTHK, I would say that I am in a bit better \n&gt;=\r\n position to know.
