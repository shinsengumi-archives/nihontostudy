I don&#39;t think that it&#39;s meant\n&gt; to refer to the uniform file finish that&#39;s seen on Goto\n&gt; pieces and others, although it does get misused that\n&gt; way in the West.\n&gt;...\n&gt; If it did represent rain and this was somehow important\n&gt; to accompany the shishi, karasu, dragon, etc., they why\n&gt; didn&#39;t it also appear on the shakudo versions of these motifs?\n\nNote that the scratches on habaki nearly always end in a &quot;burr&quot; which is\nhammered flat and forms part of the decoration.  Only rarely is the chisel cut\nclean.  One can imagine a cat scratching a tree (or you!!) and leaving a curled\nbit of bark (or flesh!) at the end of the scratch.  Hence nekogaki.  In the case\nof the Goto gold kozuka finish, or those kozuka finished without the &quot;burr&quot; at\nthe end of the scratch, then &quot;rain&quot; is most likely a correct descriptor.  Why\nscratches on gold and not shakudo??  I can only think that shakudo is &quot;shibui&quot; -\nsubdued, whereas gold is &quot;hade&quot; - flashy - and needs to be subdued, the\nscratches doing this to a &quot;T&quot;.\n\nBarry Thomas.\n\n\n"
