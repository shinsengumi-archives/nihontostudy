I&#39;m not a sword user and I&#39;m not sure who here is or\nisn&#39;t, but I wonder how much influence the weight of a tsuba right next to\nthe hand has on the feel or balance of the sword.  Does anyone have\npractical experience with how varying the weight of the guard affects the\nfeel or function of a given sword?\nJim\n\n\n&gt; Hi Matt et all,  Ithink that is exactly what I was saying. Thinner lighter\ntsuba were used for one handed sword action as the use of the sword was\ngenerally mounted ( from the horse ), later on in the The Muromachi, the\naction moved two the ground and became two handed ( both hands were free )\nthe sword didn&#39;t need to be as light and the tsuba became heavier to cope\nwith the balance required for two handed use.\n&gt;\n&gt; This is at least how I recall it, I stand corrected and look for guidence\nif I am off the mark, especially with the periods I quoted, I&#39;m trying this\nfrom memory.\n&gt;\n&gt; Rich T\n\n\n"
