The hamon running off=\r\n\n&gt; the kissaki IS a fatal flaw, make no bones about that. Swords with fatal=\r\n\n&gt; flaws that make Tokubetsu Hozon, Juyo or Yashu saku are swords of\n&gt; extr=\r\naordinary worth, and a flaw that is fatal can not take away it&#39;s\n&gt; history.=\r\n These swords are typically famous because they are rare, or\n&gt; were carried=\r\n by someone important or famous. General swords, made by the\n&gt; not so famou=\r\ns sword smiths, no matter how nice will most likely fail all\n&gt; attempts at =\r\nkanteisho if theirs is a fatal flaw like the hamon running\n&gt; off the Ha or =\r\nKissaki, a Hagiri and the likes.\n&gt;\n&gt; We all learn hard lessons and we never=\r\n like being told that our hard\n&gt; earned and well spent money if for naught,=\r\n but this is a mugs game, it\n&gt; takes nerves of steel and a firm resolve. Al=\r\nl I can suggest is to get\n&gt; over it and move on. I mean that in the nicest =\r\npossible way. I am not\n&gt; trying to be smart, just realistic.\n&gt;\n&gt; Good luck\n=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; Richard Turner\n&gt;\n&gt; Elliott wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I was complaining about learn=\r\ning nothing from shinsa (NY 2006)other\n&gt; &gt; than a falling off temperline in=\r\n the tip is (maybe) a fatal flaw.\n&gt; &gt; Since I am definitly a &#39;newbee&#39; and I=\r\n study, study, study, I found\n&gt; &gt; something called YAKIOTOSHI.
