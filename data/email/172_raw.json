Practical battlefield applications.\n\tThe kind of cutting done in battle was too rough for a small \nknife and was certainly work more suited for a tanto or wakizashi. \nOnce you enter the Edo period, there were many more uses for a \n&quot;pocket knife&quot; EG; cutting paper to leave a small note somewhere, \ntrimming a frayed edge, opening a bundle...\n\tTodays trivia question; what does Michelle Yeoh pull from her \nhair to hand Zhang Zyi to use as a &quot;pass&quot; into the Wudan warehouse in \nthe final scene of Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon?\n-t\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
