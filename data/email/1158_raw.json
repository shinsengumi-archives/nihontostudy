I posted it because the subject matter is somewhat topical, but more because it is about as good a presentation of the &quot;scanned page&quot; approach as I&#39;ve seen.  For those thinking about making texts available on line, it&#39;s worth checking this out.  I agree with you that it is not a very usable way to present the material.  I could suffer through it if it was the only way to access a text, but better methods should be used if at all possible.\n\n  Again, http://tinyurl.com/w67b is the place to look.\n\n  Jim\n\n\n  ---\n  Outgoing mail is certified Virus Free.\n  Checked by AVG anti-virus system (http://www.grisoft.com).\n  Version: 6.0.538 / Virus Database: 333 - Release Date: 10/11/2003\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
