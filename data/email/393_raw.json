I wanted to inquire, but the discussion moved on, and I didn&#39;t get a chance.  I made a note of the term to look it up, and found Hawley&#39;s definition, which applied to a sword I have at home.\n\nI think the definition you have provided is more likely what Cary and the gang were talking about, though obviously odd in the case of such an old sword.  Thanks for the information.  \n\n  \n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: Jim Gilbert \n  To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Monday, June 23, 2003 8:23 PM\n  Subject: Re: [nihontostudy] Ubuha\n\n\n  David,\n  I don&#39;t think there are different forms... it&#39;s a short section of &quot;unsharpened&quot; edge just above the hamachi.  It&#39;s not unusual with gendaito, but is rather rare in older blades.  It is ground away as the blade is polished over time.\n\n  Very old and very good saiha swords that are otherwise intact can sometimes get kanteisho.  \n\n  Hopefully someone more knowledgeable about swords can comment.\n\n  Jim\n\n\n    Can anyone think of any publications featuring illustrations of different\n    forms of ubuha?\n\n    Do retempered swords ever receive papers?\n\n\n\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n        Yahoo!
