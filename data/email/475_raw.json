The pair symbolizes\nthe best/strongest.  The pairing of lion and peony is a Chinese concept,\nand the design is still seen today among Chinese works of art/craft.  The\npeony was brought to Japan from Tang China as medicine, and the flower\nbecame popular among Heian court nobles.  Stylized botan flower became\npopular design motif, including the &quot;mon&quot; crest, by the Kamakura period.  A\nbranch of the Genji clan in Settsu Province used a &quot;mon&quot; showing shishi and\nbotan around that period (ca. 1300), so the pairing has been in Japan for\nsome time.  \n\nThe botan/shishi pair was (still is?) also a popular irezumi (tattoo) motif\namong the yakuza (gangsters).\n\n\nBest,\n\nMike Yamaguchi\n\n"
