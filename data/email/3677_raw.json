Honestly, I was perplexed about texture of the Shigeyoshi mimi. Thank you for providing some clarity.  I believe you are correct and have updated the page to reflect your observations.  Also, I left my initial thoughts there in the event that it may be helpful for those who see this texture in other works and mistakenly think it is a type of tekkotsu  :-)     \n\nBest regards,\nDanny \n\nhttp://www.nihontocraft.com/Umetada_Shigeyoshi.html\n\n&gt; \n&gt; From: &quot;Jim Gilbert&quot; &lt;jggilbert@...&gt;\n&gt; Date: 2006/01/07 Sat PM 05:59:14 EST\n&gt; To: &lt;nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Subject: Re: [nihontostudy] Commercial Message\n&gt; \n&gt; Danny,\n&gt; Nice additions to the gallery.  The Umetada Shigeyoshi seems to have a carved (or etched) rim, rather than tekkotsu.  It looks like it was also decorated with nunome zogan.  It&#39;s an unusual tsuba.\n&gt; \n&gt; Jim\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   Greetings from Nihontocraft.com \n&gt; \n&gt;   Five Tsubas have been added to the gallery for everyone&#39;s study and enjoyment. \n&gt; \n&gt;   They are as follows: Published Katsusada katchushi tsuba , Katchushi Rinbo \n&gt;   tsuba, Hozon Myochin Moritsugu tsuba , Hozon Umetada Shigeyoshi tsuba and a \n&gt;   Tokubetsu Hozon Umetada Munetake tsuba. Here is a link to the gallery: \n&gt; \n&gt;   http://www.nihontocraft.com/japanese_sword_gallery.html\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   Recent updates and additions to items available for purchase are as follows : \n&gt;   Antique Noh theater hannya demon mask, Shoami tsuba with NTHK papers and the \n&gt;   price of the Yamaoka Tesshu calligraphy has been reduced. Below are links to \n&gt;   these items.: \n&gt; \n&gt;   http://www.nihontocraft.com/noh_theater_demon_mask.html\n&gt; \n&gt;   http://www.nihontocraft.com/Owari_Tsuba.html\n&gt; \n&gt;   http://www.nihontocraft.com/Yamaoka_Tesshu.html\n&gt; \n&gt;   Please take a look if you are so inclined.\n&gt; \n&gt;   Best regards,\n&gt;   Danny Massey\n&gt;   www.nihontocraft.com \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; Yahoo!
