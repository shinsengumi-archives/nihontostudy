From the colour of the metal I am guessing at a 16th \n  &gt; century date although John Harding gave a Heian date to one in a \n  &gt; catalogue he compiled! (One of the Sarzi-Amade selling catalogues).\n  &gt;\n  &gt; I think it possible that the maker was not a professional tsuba-ko as \n  &gt; there is no reason to use such a complex construction method, the \n  &gt; maker also does not seem to have a sense of the seppa-dai as a \n  &gt; discrete area in itself, hence the curious decoration there that \n  &gt; amazingly was applied before the nakago-ana was cut through.\n  &gt;\n  &gt; Perhaps the makers of these tsuba were artisans who used this thin \n  &gt; sheet yamagane for other purposes and saw a gap in the tsuba market. \n  &gt; Does anyone know of other uses for this type of thin plate and \n  &gt; decoration?\n  &gt;\n  &gt; I have seen these illustrated in japanese books, the only one that \n  &gt; comes immediately to mind is in Nihon Toban Zusetsu by Takezawa, \n  &gt; probably by the same maker as mine, as the same defective spiral punch \n  &gt; was used for both tsuba, Takezawa called it &#39;ko-kinko&#39; Any thoughts on \n  &gt; this will be gratefully received.\n  &gt;\n  &gt; Alan\n  &gt;\n  &gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n  &gt;\n  &gt; \n\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n  Internal Virus Database is out-of-date.\n  Checked by AVG. \n  Version: 7.5.560 / Virus Database: 268.17.25/669 - Release Date: 2/4/2007 21:58\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
