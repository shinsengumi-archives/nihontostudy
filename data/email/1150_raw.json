I also don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever seen \none with a habaki.  Perhaps it&#39;s a cultural/technological hybrid, but \nI don&#39;t think that the mounting is too old.  But, nihontostudy this \nis not...\n&gt; \n&gt; Jim\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   Remember there was a &quot;colony&quot; of Bushi living in South Asia \nbefore \n&gt;   1600. OTOH couldn&#39;t this be a completely indigenous product? \nAfterall \n&gt;   they had the same technology...\n&gt; \n__________________________________________\nThe knife style is called Bade-Bade or Battig or Roentjau or I have \nseen it written roentgon or something close to that.  It is a Malayan \nknife.  Sometimes they are single and sometimes double edged.  They \ncan be found in the Celebes, Acheen, West Borneo, Sumatra and I am \nsure Indonesia.  I am certain that this particular blade is a \nJapanese blade that was modified to fit into this style of mounting.  \nThey Malay are a seafaring people who did business with virtually \neveryone in SE Asia and the Pacific Isles.  It is entirely possible \nthe blade was traded for, bought or even stolen as pirate booty.  It \nis an interesting amalgamation of styles!  I have never seen one like \nthis, but I am not surprised considering the trading and pirating \nskills of the Malay people!\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
