Of\ncourse, not crazy enough to actually learn japanese\nlike some you do.  \n\nFYI for those that want to know about the book some\nmore, the first section is all pics of the 17\ngenerations work.  then it gets into text what I\nassume is detailing a bit about each generation and\nhow you can tell it was them. Has diagrams and you can\ntell some things like one generation used a rounded\nedge etc,.  I would push for a translation more if I\nreally was collecting Goto work.  But since I don&#39;t\ncollect in that range usually ($$$$$$), there are so\nmany other books I want info on.  Of course I did\nacquire 1 nice Goto mantis piece recently (most likely\nKaga Goto). Haven&#39;t seen a Mantis Goto menuki yet. \nSome beautiful work though, amazing detail.  \n\nThen of course there are all the side groups who\nworked in similiar style and at times did more\ninteresting work as the Goto school was very rigid in\nwhat they did (ok I read that in one of those books\nout there).  Does anyone know of any articles on Kaga\ngoto?  I know there is the Kaga takain, but at around\n$700- 800, I&#39;m not in the market for it.  Gotta go the\n&quot;hidden fortress&quot; is on IFC- great samurai movie.\n\nKen aka &quot;the mantis dude&quot;\n\n--- Alan Bale &lt;abale@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; I have one for sale at GBP225 if I can find it.\n&gt; Alan\n&gt;   ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt;   From: Craig Harris \n&gt;   To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n&gt;   Sent: Saturday, May 27, 2006 4:35 PM\n&gt;   Subject: Re: [nihontostudy] Menuki Posts\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   The book Ken is referring to is:\n&gt; \n&gt;   Shimada.

The\n&gt;   &gt; heads of the rivet were decorated and eventually\n&gt; became the menuki we know\n&gt;   &gt; today.  What I did not know until these emails\n&gt; is that some menuki have\n&gt;   &gt; &quot;interlocking pins&quot; to become mekugi.  Sure,\n&gt; I&#39;ve seen these on cheap\n&gt;   &gt; Meiji\n&gt;   &gt; pieces, especially tanto, but didn&#39;t know early\n&gt; Goto menuki had the same\n&gt;   &gt; feature.  We can clearly see that as the Nihonto\n&gt; developed from earliest\n&gt;   &gt; times\n&gt;   &gt; the disadvantage of a fixed rivet became\n&gt; evident, but the early menuki\n&gt;   &gt; discussed\n&gt;   &gt; appear to have still functioned as a mekugi,\n&gt; only later becoming separate\n&gt;   &gt; with a\n&gt;   &gt; bamboo mekugi, or mekugi of other material\n&gt; (iron??).  I also remember that\n&gt;   &gt; in\n&gt;   &gt; the Momoyama period a single menuki was used,\n&gt; accounting for some of the\n&gt;   &gt; &quot;orphans&quot; we see.  Looking back over my\n&gt; collecting career I think I once\n&gt;   &gt; had a\n&gt;   &gt; single (i.e., never a pair) shakudo menuki of a\n&gt; pomegranate.  It was of\n&gt;   &gt; that\n&gt;   &gt; really dark black shakudo.  Sometimes knowledge\n&gt; comes too late to save us\n&gt;   &gt; from\n&gt;   &gt; ourselves!!!\n&gt;   &gt;\n&gt;   &gt; Ken, I do have somewhere a late 19th century\n&gt; English treatise on the Goto\n&gt;   &gt; mainline (Shirobei 17 generations) with photos,\n&gt; but it doesn&#39;t go into the\n&gt;   &gt; &quot;secret marks&quot;...  Does anyone know the title of\n&gt; the Japanese one that Ken\n&gt;   &gt; mentions??\n&gt;   &gt;\n&gt;   &gt; Regards,\n&gt;   &gt;\n&gt;   &gt; Barry Thomas.\n&gt;   &gt;\n&gt;   &gt; ----- Original Message -----\n&gt;   &gt; From: &quot;Kenneth Wilson&quot; &lt;kdw21620@...&gt;\n&gt;   &gt; To: &lt;nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt;   &gt; Sent: Sunday, May 28, 2006 12:34 AM\n&gt;   &gt; Subject: Re: [nihontostudy] Menuki Posts\n&gt;   &gt;\n&gt;   &gt;\n&gt;   &gt; Yes, I believe that at one point the menuki\n&gt; where\n&gt;   &gt; &quot;interlocking&quot; with each other, at least on some\n&gt;   &gt; styles of sword mounting design.  I can&#39;t\n&gt; remember\n&gt;   &gt; what I had read about it, but I think this was\n&gt; the\n&gt;   &gt; combo of the mekugi-ana and the menuki, but\n&gt; overtime\n&gt;   &gt; the menuki and peg seperated and served\n&gt; different\n&gt;   &gt; roles.  ok I took a stab at it, now someone can\n&gt;   &gt; correct what I said.
