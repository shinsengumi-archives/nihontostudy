It is interesting to see the shinsa team handling \niron tsuba with gloves--I understand this with kinko tsuba, but \niron? Over the years it seems each authority had his own \nopinion on what was best for caring for or handling iron tsuba. In \nreality, I think it comes down to common senese. If you have a \n&quot;treasure&quot; iron tsuba, maybe handling it with gloves (or at least \nwith great respect) goes along with placing it in a quality tsuba \nbox for safe keeping or display. It becomes more a matter of \nrespect than safe keeping. If none of these iron plates were ever \nhandled over the centuries, they probably wouldn&#39;t have that \nwonderful color and &quot;feeling&quot; we all treasure today. \n&gt; \n&gt; Ron\n&gt; STL\n&gt;   ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt;   From: steven \n&gt;   To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n&gt;   Sent: Thursday, September 23, 2004 8:40 PM\n&gt;   Subject: [nihontostudy] reply to Ron...\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   Hi Ron,\n&gt; \n&gt;   Hmmm...  I&#39;d heard that even touching iron tsuba wasn&#39;t such \na good \n&gt;   idea due to this leaving oils which would eventually invite red \n&gt;   rust...but maybe this isn&#39;t the case(?)...
