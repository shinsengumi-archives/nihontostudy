Yamaguchi \n  To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Thursday, July 03, 2003 10:23 AM\n  Subject: Re: [nihontostudy] Botan and shishi\n\n\n\n  &gt;I have seen the botan (peony) paired many times with a shishi on \n  &gt;tsuba and fuchi/kashira.\n  &gt;\n  &gt;I was wondering, what is the connection between the two/what is the \n  &gt;theme?\n\n\n  The shishi is considered the king of all animals, and the botan is\n  considered the king (if not the queen) of all flowers.  The pair symbolizes\n  the best/strongest.  The pairing of lion and peony is a Chinese concept,\n  and the design is still seen today among Chinese works of art/craft.  The\n  peony was brought to Japan from Tang China as medicine, and the flower\n  became popular among Heian court nobles.  Stylized botan flower became\n  popular design motif, including the &quot;mon&quot; crest, by the Kamakura period.  A\n  branch of the Genji clan in Settsu Province used a &quot;mon&quot; showing shishi and\n  botan around that period (ca. 1300), so the pairing has been in Japan for\n  some time.  \n\n  The botan/shishi pair was (still is?) also a popular irezumi (tattoo) motif\n  among the yakuza (gangsters).\n\n\n  Best,\n\n  Mike Yamaguchi\n\n        Yahoo!
