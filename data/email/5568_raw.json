As the saying goes, good reference books don&#39;t cost, they\npay.\n\nI&#39;ve decided to extend my sale through next Wednesday. I was out of\ntown on three separate short trips last week to tour universities with\nmy son, and did not get nearly as much new material uploaded as I had\nplanned to. Once again, it&#39;s a 33% discount on all sales of books from\nmy website, shipping at cost.\n\nI will be adding newly found books to the website, and continuing to\npack up for the Chicago Show, where I will offer a slightly less\nattractive discount since as an Illinois business making sales in\nIllinois I have to deal with a 10% sales tax.\n\nAs long as you are comfortable with orders placed near the end of the\nsale waiting until after the show to ship, order away!\n\nI&#39;m very pleased with the results, and I&#39;m glad to have made the\nacquaintance of many of you whom I did not know before.\n\nCraig\n\nhttp://www.bridgeofdreams.com\n\n-- \nCraig Harris\nBridge of Dreams, LLC\nBooks from and about Asia\nwww.bridgeofdreams.com\n\n"
