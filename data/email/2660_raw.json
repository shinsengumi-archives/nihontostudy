How confident are you about it being a late Muromachi tsuba? \nHave you or someone else seen this type of tsuba before, maybe in books \nas for reference?\nThe thing is that I have a very similar tsuba, almost identical, and i \nwould like to have as much information about it as possible. Do you \nthink it may be from the same era as yours or would mine be a later copy?\nThe measurements on my tsuba are almost the same as yours, mine is \nslightly thicker.\n8.0 cm H x 8.0 cm W x 0.4 cm T\n\nPlease take a look at it on\nhttp://hem.bredband.net/odrike/Tsuba1.htm\n\nRegards\nFredrik\n\n\n\n"
