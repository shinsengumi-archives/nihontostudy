It doesn&#39;t appear in English on\nthe thin board dust cover, but the name is in English on both the spine and\nthe front of the thicker two-piece outer cardboard box.  (I don&#39;t know the\nproper terms for these boxes, I&#39;m sure Craig would know.)  It shouldn&#39;t be\nhard to spot.  I&#39;d guess that you could get it at Isshindo:\nhttp://www.book-kanda.or.jp/kosyo/1013/index.asp\n\nJim\n\n\n&gt; Just to let everyone know that doesn&#39;t already. As Ron\n&gt; pointed out I do find books (and anything else LEGAL)\n&gt; over here in Japan for folks that ask. Sometimes I can\n&gt; find them very easily other times it takes me some\n&gt; time to locate them throughout Japan and have them\n&gt; shipped to me to send out. It has been a while since I\n&gt; updated my site and for that I appologize. But to find\n&gt; items or books any information you can get me such as\n&gt; ISBN Number is extremely helpful so is a picture of\n&gt; the cover as I am SLOWLY learning to read Japanese.\n&gt;\n&gt; Bob R\n&gt;\n&gt; =====\n&gt; Check out &quot;Cowboy&quot; Bob&#39;s Books & Things at:\n&gt; http://asia.geocities.com/gentleman9/index.html\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"
