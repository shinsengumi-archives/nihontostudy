I don&#39;t\nknow if the estimate is right, but I liked it much.\n   A few years of observing the Christies March\nMadness Japanese sale has left me with the impression\nthey overprice some of the items and underprice\nothers. If someone has the resluts from last year&#39;s\nsale, maybe they can comment on how the Juyo pieces\ndid last year.\n\nI thought the estimates on some of the other tsuba\nlots were a bit low, but then many contained signed\npieces without papers. Wish I could go up and see them\nin person, but can&#39;t find the time to this year.\n\nCurran\n\n\n\n--- Richard Turner &lt;ikkanshi@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; *http://tinyurl.com/hrryg\n&gt; \n&gt; *would the estimate on the Katchushi guard be right\n&gt; ?.
