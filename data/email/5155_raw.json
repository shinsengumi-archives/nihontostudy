It is also called a d=F4gane. Originally a s=\r\nimple  \nband to reinforce a plain wooden handle on a koshigatana, therefore=\r\n  \nthey are most often seen on wakizashi and tanto koshirae. Taira  \nTadamo=\r\nri brother of Kiyomori is known to have worn a sword with this  \nkind of ts=\r\nuka. I believe we see a lot of these from late-Edo early  \nMeiji as that wa=\r\ns a time of revival of all things classicly samurai  \nsuch as swords and su=\r\ngata from the Kamakura era. If that makes sense...\n-t\n(this info courtesy o=\r\nf Fukunaga Suiken BTW)\n\nOn Aug 25, 2007, at 7:14 PM, ikkanshi@... =\r\nwrote:\n\n&gt; Hi all, I am unsure of the history of this type of koshirae. It h=\r\nas  \n&gt; been\n&gt; in my collection for some time now but sadly I have not reall=\r\ny looked\n&gt; into it too closely.\n&gt;\n&gt; This tsuka is made of iron, and has sil=\r\nver iroe of a plum flower on a\n&gt; branch. The Kashira looks Higo and is also=\r\n Iron with gold Iroe, and  \n&gt; the\n&gt; Fuchi I am unsure though it looks low e=\r\nnd, has small gold droplets  \n&gt; on it.\n&gt;\n&gt; This came from a sword dated 180=\r\n5. I assume it to be from around a  \n&gt; that\n&gt; time before that though (one =\r\nshould never assume I know) as it has  \n&gt; been\n&gt; remounted several times an=\r\nd the core has only mekugi ana. This mekugi\n&gt; ana is the ana for the above =\r\nmentioned sword.\n&gt;\n&gt; Any offerings appreciated.\n&gt;\n&gt; Cheers\n&gt;\n&gt; Richard\n&gt;\n&gt; =\r\nhttp://www.nihontokanjipages.com/personal/tsuka/tsuka-0.jpg\n&gt;\n&gt; http://www.=\r\nnihontokanjipages.com/personal/tsuka/tsuka-1.jpg\n&gt;\n&gt; http://www.nihontokanj=\r\nipages.com/personal/tsuka/tsuka-2.jpg\n&gt;\n&gt; http://www.nihontokanjipages.com/=\r\npersonal/tsuka/tsuka-3.jpg\n&gt;\n&gt; http://www.nihontokanjipages.com/personal/ts=\r\nuka/tsuka-4.jpg\n&gt;\n&gt; \n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been remove=\r\nd]\n\n\n"
