It is a wonderful looking piece and I would love to see it\n&gt;in hand.\n&gt;\n&gt;Rich\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Curran Campbell wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Rich,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; It is a beautiful example with Juyo papers. I don&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; know if the estimate is right, but I liked it much.\n&gt; &gt;    A few years of observing the Christies March\n&gt; &gt; Madness Japanese sale has left me with the impression\n&gt; &gt; they overprice some of the items and underprice\n&gt; &gt; others. If someone has the resluts from last year&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; sale, maybe they can comment on how the Juyo pieces\n&gt; &gt; did last year.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I thought the estimates on some of the other tsuba\n&gt; &gt; lots were a bit low, but then many contained signed\n&gt; &gt; pieces without papers. Wish I could go up and see them\n&gt; &gt; in person, but can&#39;t find the time to this year.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Curran\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Yahoo!
