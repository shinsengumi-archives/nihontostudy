The brass fittings do not look to be of \nJapanese\n&gt; &gt; w=\r\norkmanship, especially the lack of a proper and neat finish \nwhere the\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nmetal\n&gt; &gt; edges meet the scabbard wood. This is especially true where the \n=\r\nhandle\n&gt; &gt; butts\n&gt; &gt; up to the habaki. The lack of a facing metal piece to =\r\nthe habaki \nindicates\n&gt; &gt; poor workmanship. It may all be modern, but the p=\r\nroof of the \npudding for\n&gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; blade will be when you take the handle=\r\n off and see the tang. Do \nthis -\n&gt; &gt; remove the habaki and take good close=\r\nup photos of both sides of \nthe tang\n&gt; &gt; and\n&gt; &gt; put them up. The blade is =\r\nthe typical shape of a Meiji tourist \npiece, but\n&gt; &gt; running through the im=\r\nages again I&#39;m of the opinion that the \nkoshirae is\n&gt; &gt; modern as it just d=\r\noes not have the refinement of shape that we \nexpect to\n&gt; &gt; see in Japanese=\r\n workmanship. So the blade may be old, but if it \ndoes not\n&gt; &gt; have a clear=\r\n and distinguishable hamon it is nonetheless a &quot;junk&quot; \npiece.\n&gt; &gt; Regards,\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; Barry Thomas\n&gt; &gt; (Melbourne, Australia)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ----- Original Message =\r\n-----\n&gt; &gt; From: Patrik Danielsson\n&gt; &gt; To: nihontostudy@ &lt;mailto:nihontostud=\r\ny%40yahoogroups.com&gt; \nyahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt; Sent: Thursday, November 27, 2008=\r\n 8:27 AM\n&gt; &gt; Subject: [nihontostudy] Question about a small Tanto or??\n&gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; Hello everybody, i bought this small &quot;tanto&quot; on an ad here in \nSweden.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; Its feel really genunine, some kind of hard wood whith nice \ngraining i=\r\nn\n&gt; &gt; saya\n&gt; &gt; and tsuka, on some places it looks like all the brass has be=\r\nen\n&gt; &gt; silverplated\n&gt; &gt; (can still se it above tha habaki on one of the pho=\r\ntos), i have \nnot been\n&gt; &gt; able to take the tsuka of it yet,but i gonna do =\r\nthat,(depending \nof the\n&gt; &gt; answers here :-)\n&gt; &gt; Can this be a &quot;tourist&quot; th=\r\ning , or is it made for a child , women \nor\n&gt; &gt; something like that?, if so=\r\nmeone have some info age or something \ni will\n&gt; &gt; really happy.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The=\r\n blade from grip (above habaki) to tip is 6.5 inches / 17 cm, \nand the\n&gt; &gt; =\r\ntotal is 10 inches/ 25.5 cm.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Here is some pictures of it:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; h=\r\nttp://s74.photobuc\n&gt; &gt; &lt;http://s74.photobucket.com/albums/i248/wellcraftant=\r\niqua/japan/&gt;\n&gt; &gt; ket.com/albums/i248/wellcraftantiqua/japan/\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Thanks=\r\n alot\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Patrik\n&gt; &gt; .\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; [Non-text portions of this message have =\r\nbeen removed]\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; -----------------------------------------------------=\r\n-----\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; No virus found in this incoming message.\n&gt; &gt; Checked by AVG.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; Version: 7.5.549 / Virus Database: 270.9.10/1814 - Release Date:\n&gt; &gt; 20=\r\n08-11-26\n&gt; &gt; 20:53\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been rem=\r\noved]\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been =\r\nremoved]\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"
