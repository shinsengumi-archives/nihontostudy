Just for your information\n\nWashika (spelling) should read WAKIZASHI\nEnd =\r\ncap should read KASHIRA\nand Collar should read FUCHI\n\nI think you are wise =\r\nto hang onto your sword, if it is part of the \nfamily history, you should k=\r\neep it fo rno other reason than that.\n\nGood luck for the future.\n\nRichard T=\r\nurner\n\n\nBECKY WALLACE wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;d like to thank everyone who has been he=\r\nlping me with Japanese Sword \n&gt; info lately. We did go to the Gun show here=\r\n in Dallas today. Sold the \n&gt; WWII Japanese rifle we had - it was not a ver=\r\ny good piece and I&#39;m glad \n&gt; to have it out of the closet. Had several peop=\r\nle look at the sword. \n&gt; The blade, as has been pointed out by some of you,=\r\n was not signed and \n&gt; it has one nick that is slightly too big to be polis=\r\nhed out, which \n&gt; detracts considerably from the value. There was concuranc=\r\ne that this \n&gt; sword was made in the 1600s and is a Washika (spelling) the =\r\nshoter \n&gt; sword. Everyone liked the tsuba, end cap and collar. I got offere=\r\nd \n&gt; about $500 for the tsuba and $100 each for the collar and end cap, but=\r\n \n&gt; just $300 for the whole thing! The conclusion I came to was that a gun =\r\n\n&gt; show was really more like a giant pawn shop than the place to really \n&gt; =\r\nget a fair assessment of value, but it was very interesting, I ran \n&gt; into =\r\nat least 3 of my co-workiers from Lockheed who had booths, and I \n&gt; did com=\r\ne\n&gt; away knowing a few things: 1. the sword is old and really not in bad \n&gt;=\r\n shape - I can continue to use it in the event of an intruder and could \n&gt; =\r\nprobably take one out with it - I&#39;m not a handgun fan :-) 2. If I \n&gt; really=\r\n had it appraised, documented, or auctioned, I&#39;d get $1500 or so \n&gt; for it,=\r\n 3. I like it more than that so will be keeping it for the \n&gt; forseeable fu=\r\nture. I&#39;ll probably drop out of this group in a few weeks \n&gt; having accompl=\r\nished my mission, but thanks for the education. I can \n&gt; sure see how this =\r\ncould become a very interesting hobby.\n&gt;\n&gt; Becky\n&gt;\n&gt; [Non-text portions of =\r\nthis message have been removed]\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message =\r\nhave been removed]\n\n\n"
