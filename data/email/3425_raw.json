My photography was horrible on this one..=\r\nI\nhad 5 minutes in bad light. The boshi is intact and healthy. No hagire\nan=\r\nywhere. The polish is a nasty semi-amateur job that makes it look\nworse the=\r\nn it is. The sword is actually very nice. In person, the\nhamon is clear and=\r\n has some activity. Lines are sharp and clean.\nYes..I agree it looks o-suri=\r\nge. Some opinions have been that it is a\nnagamaki naoshi shortened and resh=\r\naped in shinshinto or shinto times,\nand the inscriptions were done at that =\r\ntime. \nThey seem to be in the Chinese style of writing, and boast about the=\r\n\nsharpness of the sword. Would be very interested in a translation from\nHar=\r\nry, as I am told he is familiar with this type of language.\nThis one you ha=\r\nve to hold in hand to appreciate. Nothing fantastic,\nbut has a nice sugata =\r\nand nice lines. Fairly thick. I will try next\ntime to do better shots of th=\r\ne whole blade, and give dimensions.\nThanks for the comments and views. Much=\r\n appreciated.\n\nBrian\n\n--- In nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Barry Thomas&quot; &lt;=\r\nwarlord@i...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Dear Blokes (2),\n&gt; \n&gt; Barry Thomas wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; I=\r\nt would have been helpful to see the nakago and boshi\n&gt; &gt; as well to augmen=\r\nt &quot;the story&quot; as we need to see a sword in its\n&gt; &gt; totality, and not just a=\r\n &quot;selected slice&quot;...\n&gt; \n&gt; My mouth is open to receive boots of any size... =\r\n This dipstick has\njust seen\n&gt; the second picture.  Sighhh...  I plead alco=\r\nholic indulgence after a\nlong and\n&gt; exciting day...\n&gt; \n&gt; The second picture=\r\n reinforces my earlier expressed opinion - note\nthe bad ware\n&gt; at the yokot=\r\ne (a crack, heaven forbid), while the poorly polished\nkissaki\n&gt; suggests th=\r\nat the boshi &quot;runs out&quot;.  The only change I would make to\nmy earlier\n&gt; expr=\r\nessions is that the sword could be (could be!!) Sue Koto. \nHowever, from\n&gt; =\r\nwhat I can see the sword is still &quot;no chop&quot;and the nakago suggests\nthis swo=\r\nrd is\n&gt; o-suriage mumei!!!  Which reinforces the observation that a poor\nsw=\r\nord is a poor\n&gt; sword whenever it was made.  Here I must say that I&#39;m talki=\r\nng about\nthe Sword as\n&gt; Art, not whether it is a good cutter on the Sengoku=\r\n Jidai\nbattlefield.  Given\n&gt; all this, IMHO the red-lacquered inscription i=\r\ns of academic interest\nonly...\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards again,\n&gt; \n&gt; Barry Thomas.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n=\r\n\n\n"
