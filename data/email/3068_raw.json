In \nthe reference examples the first stroke of the first kanji (short \nvertical top center) touches or crosses the third stroke (top \nhorizontal).  I don&#39;t see any with a significant gap.  The 6th \nstroke (center vertical bottom) should be straight with some \nwidening at the end, not &quot;hooked.&quot;  The 7th and 8th strokes (bottom \ndiagonals) have a different shape.  The 3rd-5th strokes have \ndifferent endings.  All of the horizontal strokes of the genuine mei \nhave more of an upslope to them.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m not a Somin maven, but his signature is fairly consistent and \nthis one is different on every stroke of the first kanji.  There are \ndifferences in the rest as well, but I&#39;ll stop here.\n&gt; \n&gt; It&#39;s fairly nice katakiri-bori work, but not up to the level it \nwould have to be.\n&gt; \n&gt; Jim\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   Dear colleagues\n&gt; \n&gt;   Working on the assumption that any kodogu signed Somin is almost \n&gt;   certainly gimei, I should be interested in your comments on the \n&gt;   kodzuka in my photo album JPL.  It depicts, on a polished copper \n&gt;   ground, Shoki mounted on a shishi.  The single image is rendered \non \n&gt;   both surfaces in a skillful katakiri-bori, and is continuous \nacross \n&gt;   both edges of the kodzuka.\n&gt; \n&gt;   It is inscribed on the reverse SOMIN with kao, and also bears \nthe \n&gt;   inscription GIONEN ROKUSU ROKUSAI (aged 66 years old).\n&gt; \n&gt;   It is ex the Peak and Gardiner collections, having been \npurchased by \n&gt;   its previous owner in 1948.\n&gt; \n&gt;   Any and all comments will be most gratefully received.\n&gt; \n&gt;   Regards, JPL.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n"
