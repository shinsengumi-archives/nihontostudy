All of \n  these are present on your tsuba.\n\n  I would have=\r\n expected a tsuba of this type to be of iron, but some \n  were cast in bron=\r\nze. Interestingly these are unexpectedly attracted \n  by a magnet, but the =\r\nadmixture of up to 30% of iron to bronze in \n  order to reduce the cost of =\r\nthe expensive alloy was not unknown. \n  Also, iron was a common inclusion i=\r\nn naturally occurring copper ore \n\n  Regards, John L.\n\n  --- In nihontostud=\r\ny@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Patrick&quot; &lt;donuil_dhu@...&gt; wrote:\n  &gt;\n  &gt; Hi!
