Thanks to mentors such as Barry Thomas, I spent over \n10K in my first 3 or 4 years on my library, and I am still tweaking and \nrefining it, the more I learn, the more I realise, this books out, I \nneed that book instead. It is ongoing and I see no end to it, that&#39;s \nfine. I have been told on more than a dozen occasions, you could have \nbought 100 tsuba for that money, yes I could, but I would have 100 crap \ntsuba and I would have learnt only that &quot; this is what a crap tsuba \nlooks like&#39;. I remember sometime back someone asked on another forum, \n&quot;why the US shows don&#39;t have a lecture on Flaws, what they look like etc \nfor newbies&quot; and Gordon Robson answered, &quot; why do you want to learn \nabout flaws&quot;. I thought it the perfect answer, the author didn&#39;t. I seem \nto recall that started an interesting spat of disagreements LOL.\n\nI had a private message the other day bagging the latest NTHK shinsa \nvery heavily, and I came away questioning just how much the author of \nthat letter really knew. Some of the questions answered themselves, so I \ndid not know what it was he was asking. I assume that is what Jim is \nalso asking. What is it they want to know ?.\n\nI think there is a real leaning towards collecting for profit and resale \nand less towards collecting for study.\n\nSad, I wish I was around in the good old days.\n\nRich\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
