I plan to add furniture \nto it and use it to practice. Its a little over 2.45 shaku in \nlength..... perfect size for me. I was surprised at the length, I didn&#39;t \nthink too many were made to that length, especially in the middle 1600. \nAdding a groove would lighten it and add sound to the cuts. I know \nsomeone that sent a koto blade to Japan to have a bo-hi put on. They did \na beautiful job, several collectors have seen it and said that it did \nnot detract from the beauty of the sword. As I said in previous \nresponses I don&#39;t plan to ruin the sword and if I will do it it will be \nsent to Japan to an expert.\nEnore\n\nAlan Bale wrote:\n&gt; Gordon, Enore et al,\n&gt; I read years ago in the translation of juyo volume 2 (I think) that there was a vogue for adding grooves to fine old blades in around 1900.\n&gt; Alan\n&gt;\n&gt;   ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt;   From: Gordon Robson \n&gt;   To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n&gt;   Sent: Tuesday, December 05, 2006 11:16 PM\n&gt;   Subject: RE: [nihontostudy] Bo-hi\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   Hi Enore,\n&gt;\n&gt;   Are you talking about taking an antique sword and cutting a groove in it? I\n&gt;   hope not. There is no one I know of in Japan who would do that. And I think\n&gt;   you would be hard pressed to find someone who would even do it to a newly\n&gt;   made blade. The sword comes as it is and anything added later is typically\n&gt;   not seen as a good thing.\n&gt;\n&gt;   Gordon\n&gt;\n&gt;   -----Original Message-----\n&gt;   From: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com [mailto:nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com] On\n&gt;   Behalf Of egardonio\n&gt;   Sent: Wednesday, December 06, 2006 2:28 AM\n&gt;   To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;   Subject: [nihontostudy] Bo-hi\n&gt;\n&gt;   Hello everybody, I&#39;m new to this forum so if I make an error please\n&gt;   remember that. Has anybody had the experience, or do you know, of\n&gt;   having a Bo-hi done to a Nihonto?\n&gt;   For example, does one have to send the nihonto to Japan or can the job\n&gt;   be done in North America.\n&gt;   Thanks for any information\n&gt;   Enore\n&gt;\n&gt;   [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;    \n&gt;\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt; Yahoo!
