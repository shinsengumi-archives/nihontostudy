The carving is \nof a very high quality, as is the skillful gold inlay.\n\nThe presence of the hira-zogan gold seal, together with the image of \nChinan stirring up a storm is suggestive of Tetsugendo work, but I \nbelieve that the brightness and sophistication of the image together \nwith the polished, brown surface of the metal exclude such a \nprovenance.\n\nI personally favour Okawa Teikan (Sadamoto) as the artist, but have \nbeen unable to find this particular seal among the many that this \nartist used.\n\nI am sorry about the poor quality of my first effort at posting \nphotographs, and will try again if they are felt to be inadequate.\n\nRegards, John L.\n\n\n\n\n"
