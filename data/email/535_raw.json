IMHO\nunless it is a matter of verifying a mei of a famous\nmaker; getting info is the main reason for submitting for\npapers. I agree that at the current rates, especially for\nthe NBTHK, it is not feasible to submit anything but very\nhigh grade fittings. The cost of the shinsa is more than\nthe fittings (even with papers) would be worth in most cases.\nJust my humble $0.03 worth (to allow for inflation)\n\nRich\n\n\n\n"
