It&#39;s a kind of shiiremono that\n&gt;copied Mino/Goto style.  These fittings are often marketed as &quot;Mino Goto,&quot;\n&gt;but the quality of the materials and workmanship is not at that level of\n&gt;work.\n&gt;\n&gt;The problem is not that they have been cleaned, but that they are not made\n&gt;out of shakudo.  This type of fitting is often coated with a thin black wash\n&gt;to simulate shakudo, but that is often worn away from the seppa dai.  The\n&gt;nanako is more coarse than would be seen in genuine Mino or Goto work.\n&gt;Rather than using gold inlay/overlay a thin gold wash is used.  Where this\n&gt;is rubbed on the high spots the underlying copper shows through.  The\n&gt;quality of the carving is not at the level Mino or Goto work.\n&gt;\n&gt;As Ron says there is a continuum of this type of material ranging from very\n&gt;poor to pretty good.  The distinction between lower quality Mino-bori and\n&gt;higher quality Nagoya-mono can be pretty fuzzy.\n&gt;\n&gt;I doubt that the fuchigashira and tsuba are by the same person.  The details\n&gt;of the carving of the peony  are quite different.  They are the same type of\n&gt;work though.  They&#39;re probably from the late Edo period.  There are quite a\n&gt;few wakizashi mounted with this style of tosogu.\n&gt;\n&gt;Jim\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Ron and readers,\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;It seems like your impression has its followers. Someone on Rich Turners\n&gt;&gt;message board agreed on Mino Goto, and they are probably made from the\n&gt;&gt;same hand. However he also said the set had been cleaned and should be\n&gt;&gt;repatinated by an expert. I donï¿½t see the damage but what do I know.:)\n&gt;&gt;I decided to take photos of the menukis as well. However they do not\n&gt;&gt;seem to match the rest of the fittings. What is your opinion on them?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Here is the menukis.\n&gt;&gt;http://hem.bredband.net/odrike/Menuki2.htm\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Here is the rest of the fittings again.\n&gt;&gt;http://hem.bredband.net/odrike/Tosogu1.htm\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Fredrik\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Ron Hartmann wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Fredrik -\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Not having the pictures in front of me at this moment, my impression\n&gt;&gt;&gt;      \n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;earlier was that they were the work of Mino Goto, same period. Maybe Jim\n&gt;Gilbert is watching and can elaborate on this for you.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Ron\n&gt;&gt;&gt;      \n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;Yahoo!
