I have a lacquered\nleather jingasa that is totally rigid and hard. \n\nAlso, perhaps (?) the way the leather is laid down in layers\nhas something to do with the rigidity and hardness. If\nthe grain is laid down at 90 degrees in the different\nlayers, it may (?) make a difference. Also the type of\nglue used could effect it although I suspect that rice\nglue was what was commonly used. Does lacquer itself\nhave &quot;glue&quot; properties? Maybe the layers were lacquered\ntogether to greater strength as well as having a lacquer\ncoat for weather proofing.\n\nJust more thinking/speculating out loud. Interesting\nthread. I&#39;ll have to try my hand at making a leather\ntsuba too :-)\n\nrich\n------------------------------------------------------------\n Richard Stein, PhD          alchemyst@...\n      \n             The Japanese Sword Index\n  http://www.geocities.com/alchemyst/nihonto.htm\n  http://home.earthlink.net/~steinrl/nihonto.htm\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n"
