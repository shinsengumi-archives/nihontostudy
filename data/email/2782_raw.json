Haynes [sale 5: item 63] illustrates a virtually identical tsuba, differing slightly in dimensions (Haynes&#39; is a little smaller). Also Haynes&#39; maple leaves have gold nunome highlights, while my tsuba retains traces of red pigment.  I called mine Shoami, and described it as mid-to late Edo, while Haynes identifies his as Kyo Shoami, and attributes it specifically to Genroku.  \n\nIf you&#39;d like to compare them. mine is at:\n\nhttp://www.zincavage.org/DeerandMaple.html\n\nI&#39;ll soon be adding the Haynes picture for comparison, and modifying the text.  \n\n\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: MuramasaIII@... \n  To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Wednesday, April 13, 2005 9:28 AM\n  Subject: Re: [nihontostudy] Re: Takeda Shingen & Uetsugi Kenshin symbolism\n\n\n\n  In a message dated 4/13/2005 11:01:25 A.M. Central Daylight Time,  \n  jdz@... writes:\n\n  when I  finally obtained a copy of the 5th Haynes Auction Catalogue from the  \n  1980s.  Mr. Haynes listed an almost identical tsuba, I would say clearly  \n  from the same hand, stating that these were symbols of the battles between  \n  Takeda Shingen and Uesugi Kenshin.  So I was trying to pursue that lead.  \n\n\n\n\n  I fail to see the connection but then Haynes is Haynes..........\n  if there&#39;s an &quot; animal connection &quot;, then it should be a tree and a bird (  \n  woodpecker ? ). Recall that battle when the Takada  diverted part of the  army \n  to sneak attack the castle where Uesugi was holding up ? Except when they  \n  arrived, the Uesugi already left in the fog, crossed the river and attack the  \n  Takada base camp. Same battle as Shingen blocked Kenshin&#39;s sword with his war  \n  fan.\n\n  milt\n\n\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  Yahoo!
