The examples I&#39;ve seen in the outside of Japan have all been Edo period, and most if not all from the late Edo period.  They&#39;re quite new and shiny looking.  They often have some sort of decoration to the lacquer.  The fukurin (rim cover) are new and crisp looking.  The guards tend to be on the small side, but thicker than a similarly sized metal guard from the same period.\n\nMost of the Heian and Kamakura period examples at Oyamazumi are delaminated.  If they hadn&#39;t been left untouched &quot;strung&quot; on the nakago of the swords they&#39;re mounted on they would likely have been discarded long ago.  Probably one reason why there are so few old examples around.  Mokko shape seems to predominate.  These tend to be larger diameter with moderate thickness.  The ones that are still intact just look very old in comparison to the Edo period examples.  Hard to be more quantitative about that.  I can&#39;t remember seeing a decorated example from the early period.\n\nI don&#39;t have a big enough sample to work from to be too confident, but the nerikawa guards from late Kamakura, Nanbokucho and early Muromachi tend to look disproportionately thick compared to the earlier ones.  The Nanbokucho and Muromachi ones are more often round or oval shaped rather than mokko.  Some mokko examples from that time have unusually small &quot;lobes.&quot;  \n\nThat&#39;s all I can think of for now.\n\nJim\n\n\n  hi ye all,\n  question...............how do you date nerikawa tsuba since they were \n  made from Kamakura period all the way to edo ? Is there any stylistic \n  changes over different time period ?\n  Thanks,\n\n  milt\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
