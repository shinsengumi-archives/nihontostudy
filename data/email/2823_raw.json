It was a good introduction to Hirata\n&gt; tsuba.\n&gt;\n&gt; The major thing learned by me was to look closely at\n&gt; the fukurin on such tsuba if you don&#39;t have then in\n&gt; hand. The quality of workmanship there can be the most\n&gt; revealing to those like myself who are newbie to\n&gt; Hirata tsuba. The fukurin of the tsuba in discussion\n&gt; seemed to be suspect- but is not a certain thing-,\n&gt; plus it was discussed that there have been a number of\n&gt; semi-modern ones floating around within the last year.\n&gt;    In addition, it was discussed that a good number of\n&gt; convincing &quot;post edo&quot; produced katchushi tsuba have\n&gt; popped up recently and are being passed off as older\n&gt; works.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks all for the information.\n&gt;\n&gt; Curran\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"
