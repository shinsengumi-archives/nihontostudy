The design looks more like something derived from Kyoto and 3 mm is pretty thin for Owari.  Without seeing the metal in person it&#39;s hard to say with a guard like that.  I&#39;ve seen a few tsuba with classic Kyo sukashi designs that had purely Owari iron and no doubt were Owari, but I&#39;m sure I would have said Kyo if I had only seen a face-on photo.\n\nThe guard that Curran posted is attributed to Owari, but mid Edo period.  Most of the Owari characteristics of the iron are usually lost by then, but it looks like that one still has a bone or two.  It&#39;s 5 mm thick and appears to have the squarish rim that you&#39;d expect from Owari work.  The design is also a bit more blocky.  BTW, Owari-esq guards that have rounded rims are usually attributed to Shoami.\n\nSome later Kyo and Owari guards can be difficult to separate.  I can&#39;t think of an obvious alternative school for your guard.  Enjoy cleaning it and studying it further.\n\nJim\n\n\n\n  Just got this tsuba. Needs some boning and fussing, but I&#39;m wondering \n  about school. I think probably either Kyo-sukashi or Owari. However, \n  what may be iron bones on the mimi just look like rust bumps, so I \n  lean toward Kyo-sukashi. 76mm x 3mm.\n  Maybe some other school altogether?\n  Any thoughts appreciated. \n\n  http://gcclearn.gcc.vccs.edu/stein/tsuba.jpg\n\n  Thanks\n  Rich S\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
