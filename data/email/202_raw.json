The Minoto Taikan had a\nsmall sized oshigata and that compared very well. Even better was Nihonto\nZuikan -- yes, if you do not have this set of books, you will never know\nwhat you have. There were two, first gen. oshigata here and they both\nmatched very well, particularly the katana oshigata. So, my call -- genuine\nsignature of 1st. gen. Shinano no Kami Daido, circa Kanei.\n\nGordon\n  -----Original Message-----\n  From: Ron Polansky [mailto:yamabrp@...]\n  Sent: Monday, May 05, 2003 11:34 PM\n  To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com\n  Subject: [nihontostudy] Mino Daido\n\n\n  All:\n\n  I was wondering if someone had a Mino Taikon that had a matching mei:\n  Shinano (no) Kami Fujiwara Daido\n  http://www.nihontophile.com/Daido1.jpg (nakago rubbing)\n  http://www.nihontophile.com/Daido2.jpg (picture of blade)\n  (hada is tighter than most Mino I have seen)\n\n  I was wondering which generation?\n  (judging by the sori, etc., I was guessing 1st generation...blade\n  looks early Shinto)\n\n  Thanks for the help!\n  Ron\n\n\n\n        Yahoo!
