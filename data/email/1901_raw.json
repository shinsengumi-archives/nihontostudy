I bought this sword the 21th. of february 2004, \npayed it but n=\r\never received it. By request I received several other \nphotos of the sword =\r\nand the NBTHK papers as well as copies from his \npassport and driverslicens=\r\ne. This information is avaible for the \nlist if you don=B4t find it inconve=\r\nnient. Look well at this sword on \nebay and take care of wolflady 137 and j=\r\nnetweb as well as John \nPivec, Minneapolis, USA. This sword will without an=\r\ny doubt be put \nfor sale again. If anyone has this sword in their possessio=\r\nn, please \nlet me know. I will award informations which will place the swor=\r\nd at \nmy house with 1000 U.S.dollars. If the Nihonto study group find it \na=\r\nppropiate I will put photos of the sword as well as John Pivecs \npassport a=\r\nnd driverslicense, on the list. \nThe Danish Criminal Police, The Danish For=\r\neign Ministry and the USA \nPolice are involved in the investigation and I h=\r\nave asked ebay to \nhelp with information as well.\nThankyou for your help in=\r\n advance\nAll the best\nAllan\n\n\n"
