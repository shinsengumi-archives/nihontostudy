One thing to remember is that Ko-Mino kogai come in very odd\nsizes, particularly very narrow ones. This kogai could not be made into a\nkozuka because it was too narrow. Also, Ko-Mino pieces are carved directly\nfrom the metal - no inlays. They did overlays, which do not pop out. The\nmimikaki was cut off and joined to the base of the decorative panel - the\nline is still there. The kogai was very early, and so much of the work is\nindistinct. Still an interesting piece.\n\n\n\nGordon\n\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: alchemyst [mailto:alchemyst@...]\nSent: Saturday, November 01, 2003 1:43 PM\nTo: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: [nihontostudy] Re: Naoshi fuchi\n\n\n\nGordon -\n\nYou were correct, I totally missed the kogai/fuchi connection.\n(Easy to do when you only have 6 functional brain cells, or is\nit five???)\n\nSeriously, I can&#39;t imagine the metal working skill to bend\na kogai around into a fuchi without damage; crimping the metal,\npopping the inlay, etc. Is there any way you can post better\npics of the fuchi? I&#39;d love to see more detail of the work.\n\nThanks\nRich S\n------------------------------------------------------------\nRichard Stein, PhD          alchemyst@...\n\n             The Japanese Sword Index\n  http://www.geocities.com/alchemyst/nihonto.htm\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYahoo!
