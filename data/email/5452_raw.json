Yes I think this =\r\nis a Repo also, but maybe late 20th\n&gt; &gt;   century as a guess. It&#39;s a copy, =\r\nI believe of a K=F4 Sh=F4ami tsuba that was\n&gt; &gt;   originally done in a soft=\r\n metal (Yamagane from memory) in the Momoyama\n&gt; &gt;   period, or perhaps a bi=\r\nt earlier.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;   Anyway. as I said, I think this is a very modern repo,=\r\n just my opinioon\n&gt; &gt;   nayway.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;   Cheers\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;   Richard\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n  darpa_ems wrote:\n&gt; &gt;   &gt;\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; I&#39;ve had this tsuba for well over 20 yea=\r\nrs, & have wondered what info\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; there might be on it... It&#39;s a rabbit=\r\n & waves design, with no ID \n&gt; &gt;marks.\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; It&#39;s iron, about 8cm x 8.5cm=\r\n x 4mm. I believe it&#39;s a early 20th\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; cent. repro, at least I kind of=\r\n hope it is, as it&#39;s been on several of\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; my practice swords over the=\r\n years... When I got it it had a nice solid\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; brown patina, but enoug=\r\nh rust scaling to need cleaning with a \n&gt; &gt;wirewheel.\n&gt; &gt;   &gt;\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; Pics =\r\nare here-\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; http://ph.groups.yahoo.com/group/nihontostudy/photos/brow=\r\nse/e85a\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   &gt;\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated.=\r\n Not looking to sell it,\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; just info on period, school, maker, etc...=\r\n :)\n&gt; &gt;   &gt;\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; Thanks!\n&gt; &gt;   &gt;\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; A.W.\n&gt; &gt;   &gt;\n&gt; &gt;   &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;   =\r\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ----=\r\n--------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo!
