Sukidashi-bori and sukidashi takabori are used when\nthere is carving that digs downward into the flat surface of the tsuba and\ncreates high relief carvings. Such carving typically does not include\nsukashi work.\n\n \n\nGordon\n\n \n\n  _____  \n\nFrom: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com [mailto:nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com] On\nBehalf Of Ron Hartmann\nSent: Friday, April 04, 2008 10:48 AM\nTo: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: Re: [nihontostudy] Tsuba carving terminology\n\n \n\nOne more example tsuba has been added to my photos - Ron STL album - tsuba\n#627 and 227 are the ones I&#39;m referring to. \n\nTsuba 227 design is all made (carved) below its plate surface the same as\n627 except this one is more elaborately done with the plum blossom branch\ndesign. \n\nAlso an interesting tsuba that has a Choshu design but the work is much more\nthin and delicate and looks more Kyoto-something to me...could it be\nKyo-Shoami?

(In this case, the tsuba is\nactually tapered, the flat edge being 1 mm less than the seppa-dai surface.)\nIn the Boston book Ogawa called this sukidashi takabori in the Hayne/Harvie\nstudy book it seems to be called horiage (if I&#39;m understanding the\ndescription correction) and also another term which I can&#39;t find right now. \n\nIs there a common name for this type of sunken relief carving? \n\nRon\nSTL\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n \n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
