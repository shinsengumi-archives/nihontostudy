But my suspicion is that craftsmen that specialized in lacquer work would be the ones to capitalize in the production of these items.  I don&#39;t know anything about the leather trade in Japan,  but this work is still done today on kendo equipment.  On a better quality Do (mid-body armor) it is made with bamboo strips and a thick peace of leather that is glued to the strips and then the leather is lacquered over.  The lacquered surface is extremely durable.\n\nMoses\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: Jim Gilbert \n  To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Tuesday, June 03, 2003 2:58 PM\n  Subject: Re: [nihontostudy] Nerikawa Nagamaki Tsuba FYI\n\n\n  Mo,\n  I&#39;ve wondered just who made these leather fittings.  Were they made by general leather workers that made all sorts of items, or by people who specialized in arms and armor?  My guess is that they weren&#39;t made by the same people who were making metal sword fittings, armor, etc., given the class issues around hide working.  Has anyone researched the pre-industrial leather trade in Japan?\n\n  Jim\n\n\n\n    Jim & all,\n\n    I see, perhaps it was just a common technique use on different items.  Swords, Nagamaki, boken and shinai.\n\n    Moses\n\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n        Yahoo!
