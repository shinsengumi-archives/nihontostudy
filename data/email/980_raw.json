The \nplate is the very best deep black shakudo. The mochi cake is heavy \nsheet silver uttori over the shakudo.  The wiskers and eyes of the \nrats are gold uttori.  The hair of the rats is very well defined, \nthough worn down.  The mochi cake has many of the secret main line \nGoto marks.  This pair would be about the time of Tokujo or Yeijo, \nthe fifth and sixth mainline Goto masters (ca.1575-1600 ).  I have \nseen another pair of menuki almost identical with this pair ( and \nincluding the matching kogai ) with the original Goto papers stating \nthem to be the work of Tokujo.  This pair is every bit as fine. Juyo \nmaterial. Ca.1600  &quot;\n\nNothing is for sure till they are submitted for shinsa, at least it \nlooks &quot; encouraging &quot;.\n\n-M\n\n\n"
