I suppose that as the samurai class got squeezed financially, mounts may have been simplified.  If anything the fancier koshirae in the Edo period were more likely to be fully outfitted with kozuka and kogai.\n\nSome of the filled ana that we see were added by collectors after the tsuba were no longer worn.  I don&#39;t know how many that accounts for.\n\nJim\n\n\n\n  Has anyone ever heard any theories on why you see so many tsuba with \n  ume in their hitsuana?  Was there possibly a change in style or \n  utilization into Edo which eliminated the need for the utensils?  \n  Thanks!\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
