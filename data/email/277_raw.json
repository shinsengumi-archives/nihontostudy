The tsuba on the\nUesugi Kenshin pieces are yamagane and kiku shaped sukashi pieces. My\nnagamaki has a rounded-square disk in yamagane -- absolutely plain.\n\nGordon\n  -----Original Message-----\n  From: Richard George [mailto:rkg@...]\n  Sent: Friday, May 23, 2003 1:21 PM\n  To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com\n  Subject: [nihontostudy] polearm tsuba question\n\n\n  hey guys,\n\n  Are there any other polearm lovers out there - check out this tsuba - it\n  supposedly came off a nagamaki:\n\n  http://home.teleport.com/~rkg/misc/front_small.JPG\n  http://home.teleport.com/~rkg/misc/front_small.JPG\n  http://home.teleport.com/~rkg/misc/edge_small.JPG\n  (there are a few other closeups in the same directory, but I didn&#39;t\n  quite get a couple of &#39;em in focus - sorry about\n  presenting this upside down, but I really busy last night and didn&#39;t get\n  a chance to rotate the photos...).\n\n  The piece is 2.885&quot; by 2.73&quot; by.21&quot; thick at the rim and ~.175 in the\n  center.  The rim appears to be\n  silver, and the sukashi pieces appear to be filled with lead.\n\n  The piece appears to be pretty old (Jim pointed out that it looked like\n  there were a couple of layers of lacquer\n  on it), and the lead makes it really heavy for a tsuba of this size.\n\n  So, has anybody seen something like this on a &quot;real&quot; naginata/nagamaki\n  koshirae?  any attempts at kantei, observations,\n  etc., would be greatly appreciated.\n\n  thanks,\n\n  rkg\n  (Richard George)\n\n\n\n\n\n        Yahoo!
