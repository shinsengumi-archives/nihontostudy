Please \nrefer to the Photos section at left, in the NC folder. The tanto is \nsigned Bishu Osafune Kiyo(mitsu?) and Eiroku jyu ichi (nen?) (?) \ngatsu hi (1568). Q #1: Is it indeed kazu uchimono? Seems so, given \nthe Bishu vs. Bizen mei, the date, plus it also has a lot of loose \nhada and forging ware. Q #2: Any idea as to which Kiyomitsu made \nit? Q #3: Is it common for kazu uchimono of this area and time to \nhave loads of utsuri and nijuba/sanjuba as does this example? That \nis, while the forging was apparently quick and dirty, it appears that \nthis blade got the full professional tempering treatment. Possibly \nthe smiths were so used to doing the tempering correctly that they \njust did it as a matter of course, even for bundled blades? Thanks \nin advance for any and all input!\n\nNC\n\n\n\n"
