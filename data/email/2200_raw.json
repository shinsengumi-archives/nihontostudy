It is interesting to see the shinsa team handling iron tsuba with gloves--I understand this with kinko tsuba, but iron? Over the years it seems each authority had his own opinion on what was best for caring for or handling iron tsuba. In reality, I think it comes down to common senese. If you have a &quot;treasure&quot; iron tsuba, maybe handling it with gloves (or at least with great respect) goes along with placing it in a quality tsuba box for safe keeping or display. It becomes more a matter of respect than safe keeping. If none of these iron plates were ever handled over the centuries, they probably wouldn&#39;t have that wonderful color and &quot;feeling&quot; we all treasure today. \n\nRon\nSTL\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: steven \n  To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Thursday, September 23, 2004 8:40 PM\n  Subject: [nihontostudy] reply to Ron...\n\n\n  Hi Ron,\n\n  Hmmm...  I&#39;d heard that even touching iron tsuba wasn&#39;t such a good \n  idea due to this leaving oils which would eventually invite red \n  rust...but maybe this isn&#39;t the case(?)...  It&#39;s rather surprising \n  to think that there is such a variety of opinion on this issue!  \n  Thanks for the input!\n\n  Steve\n\n\n        Yahoo!
