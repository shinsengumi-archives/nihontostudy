Were litigation on Nihonto underway, I think it\n&gt; would be highly likely that the NRA, and other gun rights\n&gt; organizations, would be willing to assist.\n\nIf you are a member, then it should be something that they should be\nable to provide you with information wise. It will be helpful to\neveryone to know what the extent (and if they really have) of their help\nis.\n\n&gt; Personally, I think the case of Australia illustrates very clearly\n&gt; what will happen to weapons collectors who are sufficiently in the\n&gt; minority, and who fail to organize in time.  \n\nIt looks to me like they are going to decide that criminals can&#39;t own\nthem. I don&#39;t think that is as bad as what we had thought, but maybe I\nmisread what their intention was.\n\n&gt; Bans of private weapons are feel-good symbolic measures giving\n&gt; politicians the opportunity to be seen taking action.  \n\nIn the opinion of an NRA member.\n\n&gt; And this philosophy is very popular on the political left, which\n&gt; yearns to increase the powers of the state, particularly the state&#39;s\n&gt; monopoly of force.\n\nActually, they prefer of thinking of it as keeping deadly weapons out of\nthe hands of the stupid, and the brutal.\n\nAnd there are those in the center, who adopt some conservative and some\nliberal views, who also do not like the thoughts of military style\nfirearms on the streets. I am more than happy to oblige the hunter, the\nmarksman, and the collector their rifles and hunting weapons of all\nsorts.\n\nIt falls in my realm of common sense though that flooding the streets\nwith military ordinance will not put the public at risk of them. \n\nThis logic pervails in the US government and people, who no doubt\napplauded the arrest of the arms dealer who was selling a shoulder\nmounted missile into the USA (a fake, but he thought it real). \n\nTherein lies the logic, and everyone embraced it. You don&#39;t need a\nRussian made plane-downer. The logic is fully embraced by almost all, I\nthink only a true blue died in the wool something or other can convince\nhimself that every house needs a shoulder mounted missile.\n\nAttempts to attack the logic then are not really that valid. The issue\nis more one of &quot;where do you draw the line.&quot; We are all talking similar\nstories. \n\nEven the extremist who wants a heat seeking missile might consider that\npublic ownership of nuclear weapons is not a good thing (it would,\nhowever, protect one nicely from the tyrrany of the government). \n\nSo with that said, my own line is pretty good and in tune with where\nCanada put it. The USA has the line shortly to the north, but there is a\nlot of talk about how if that line gives one iota then the country will\nfall to pieces. Maybe it will, but I don&#39;t see examples around me in the\nreal world that reflect that.\n\nI&#39;ll say it again, if the people around me lose their assault weapons, I\ndon&#39;t think I&#39;ll lose my swords (it has already happened here, I think\nsince before I was born). \n\nThe logic is sound, it&#39;s really about where the line is.\n\n&gt; The affluent and educated sectors of Ameri can society typically live\n&gt; in congested urban environments.  They do not hunt or target-shoot.\n&gt; They are estranged from the tradition of military service and the use\n&gt; of arms.  And they look with contempt on less educated, rural sectors\n&gt; of American society in which hunting, ownership of arms, and military\n&gt; service are highly valued traditions.\n&gt;  The wealthy bourgeois living in a million dollar house in Palo Alto\n&gt; thinks it is simply criminally irresponsible to allow a bunch of rubes\n&gt; and other denizens of American society&#39;s lower orders to play with\n&gt; dangerous weapons.  Who knows? one of these losers might even shoot\n&gt; him.\n\nI think you set a record there for sweeping generalizations. Sounds like\nthe *real* thing to do would be to just kill all the rich city folk and\nthe country would be in a state of bliss and harmony ;-).\n\nI think that with nothing concrete at all here that has anything to do\nwith swords, the NRA stuff should get an off topic / political treatment\nuntil someone can cite a live example. So that&#39;s all from me on this, my\npoints have been stated.\n\nI do want to believe that the NRA would help sword owners, but there is\nnothing here that has been presented which is not just simple and many\ntimes repeated gun-owner rhetoric, complete with the sweeping\ngeneralizations, simplification of issues, and demonization of those\nthat don&#39;t agree with the political opinion.\n\n- darcy\n\n\n"
