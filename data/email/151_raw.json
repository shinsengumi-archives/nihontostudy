I&#39;m not seeing the second character on the left very well, but if you&#39;re seeing it as the other &quot;toshi,&quot; that kanji can also be read Naga and there are a number of makers signing that way including the Nara Toshinaga of sansaku fame.\n\nJim\n  I bought a couple lower end pieces while in Japan because I liked the\n  composition. Now I&#39;m screwing around with the mei.\n\n  The first is a tsuba that I read as Hiro Yuki and the third character\n  escapes me.\n\n  The second I was told was Nara Toshichi... when I look up those\n  characters for the mei though on the left, I get Toshi, and an alternate\n  Toshi. The last is a cao?\n\n  Can someone shed some light on this for me?\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
