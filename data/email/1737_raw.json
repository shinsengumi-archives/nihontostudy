I had two blades, both Pacific War era, \nnearly identically rusty (i.e., very rusty, big crusts of red/black \noxide, hard to see the hamon).  One was a traditionally made blade by \nMasamura, the other a Showa stamped blade by Kumemune.  As it turned \nout, the pitting was very shallow on the Kumemune, but very, very \ndeep on the Masamura, despite the nearly identical appearance on the \nsurfaces of the two blades.  I couldn&#39;t get all the pitting out of \nthe Masamura, was just too deep, would&#39;ve had to whittle the blade \ndown to nothing!  With the Kumemune, I had more work to do to iron \nout the waves left from the original polish.  Bottom line, you can&#39;t \ntell by looking (except perhaps if you are a professional polisher).  \nYou need to determine if it&#39;s worth the expense to have a \nprofessional evaluate the blade and perhaps open a window to see \nwhether a full polish is appropriate.  FWIW.\n\nNC\n\n\n"
