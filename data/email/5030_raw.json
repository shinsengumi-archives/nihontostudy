The sword was coming \nfrom Canada, and the dealer used UPS Overnight Express and gave me \ntracking info.\n\nThe sword was delayed for a couple of days at the Louisville UPS \nReceiving Center, and according to their website, a &quot;non-customs \nagency&quot; was delaying it. After another day, I was contacted by a UPS \nrepresentative. I&#39;d been worried that suddenly swords were illegal \nhere in the US or something, but no.\n\nBizarre as it may sound, the problem was the same (wrapping). U.S. \nFish & Wildlife had decided they wanted to know exactly what species \nof stingray had been used in making the wrapping!!! I explained to \nthe young lady that these wrappings had been done in Japan, sometimes \ncenturies back, and save DNA testing or a reliable time machine, no \none was going to get the exact species.\n\nThis is the first time I&#39;ve ever heard of this happening, and the \ndealer was equally surprised and perplexed.\n\nIn the end the UPS girl said she&#39;d put in the commonest species in \nthe form, and hope for the best. A couple of days later it was \nfinally released, and the sword is now in my hands.\n\nAgain, I can&#39;t stress enough how good the dealer was throughout, I&#39;ll \nlet him identify himself if he wants to, but I wanted to send this \nnote out as a warning to anyone bringing swords into the U.S. through \nUPS, especially if the shipment clears customs through Louisville. \nUPS Louisville was recently declared a Wildlife Preservation Clearing \nstation, according to the UPS lady. She added that Fish & Wildlife is \ngoing to take a higher interest in this, and since I doubt any civil \nservant (always excepting any who might be on this list) have a clue \nas to what a nihonto is, more problems are likely.\n\nAnyone else seen anything like this?\n\nDe wa,\n\nAndres\n\n\n"
