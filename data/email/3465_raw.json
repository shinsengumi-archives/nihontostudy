I would like to give some clue =\r\nso that readers of \nthis \n&gt; message would came up with similar beliefe as I=\r\n did.\n&gt; \n&gt; 1. Chinese emperor was the only one who is entitled to put drago=\r\nn \n&gt; decors on everything he owned. \n&gt; 2. However dragons could also put to=\r\n use as icons by other persons \nor \n&gt; entities only if the number of dragon=\r\n&#39;s fingers reduced to either \n4 \n&gt; or 3. Five fingers claws must not be use=\r\nd in any dragon unless the \n&gt; owner of that dragon design is Chinese empero=\r\nr himself. Violation \nof \n&gt; such rule was subject to capital punishment.\n&gt; =\r\n3. There used to be a continued flow of sword import from Japan \n&gt; dating b=\r\nack more than a thousand years.\n&gt; 4. Swords as possibly one of the contribu=\r\ntions to Chinese emperor \n&gt; during Qing Dynasty would demand unique design =\r\nfor their tsubas. \n&gt; Guess what design would it use?\n&gt; 5. Any contribution =\r\nto the king would bear no signature of the \n&gt; artist. Guess what? This eleg=\r\nant iron tsuba bear no signature on \n&gt; neither side.  \n&gt; 6. I am in no posi=\r\ntion to do the authentication on the style of \nthe \n&gt; dragon shown on this =\r\ntsuba. Somehow its style poised to resemble \nthe \n&gt; one shown on Meiji coin=\r\ns. There is strong likelihood that this \ntsuba \n&gt; was of Japan origin datin=\r\ng back to late 19th century.\n&gt; 7. Guess who is in the position in Japan to =\r\noffer this tsuba as \npart \n&gt; of a sword to Chinese emperor then?\n&gt; \n&gt; I hop=\r\ne you enjoy as much as I when pondering the answers to those \n&gt; questions. =\r\nYou probably would find some interesting part of \ndetails \n&gt; missing. Reade=\r\nrs and I would like to hear them.\n&gt; \n&gt; Now, it is time that tsuba expert an=\r\nd historians take over \n&gt; authentication processes from here. \n&gt; \n&gt; Chen, Y=\r\ning-chaw\n&gt; Taipei\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n"
