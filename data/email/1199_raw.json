I have taken pictures (best effort), the tsuba appears to be shakudo.\n\nhttp://www.auctionpix.com/dec1/jonemvc-016s.jpg\n\nhttp://www.auctionpix.com/dec1/jonemvc-019s.jpg\n\nthanks\n\n\nMark Jones\nnixe@... \n\n\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: alchemyst \n  To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Monday, December 01, 2003 7:02 PM\n  Subject: [nihontostudy] Re: My Mito tsuba followup\n\n\n  Ken -\n\n  The styles of Aizu Shoami and Mito are very similar IMHO.\n  Although I think the better, high end Mito work is a bit\n  superior. Both schools did a lot of copying of other\n  schools (Nara especially) work. Both schools produced\n  tons of shiriimono, but also some nice pieces. I like\n  the ones you&#39;ve shown and hope you are able to get them.\n  IMHO the school doesn&#39;t matter as long as you like them.\n  (Collect what you like, but like what you collect :-)\n\n  Rich S\n  ------------------------------------------------------------\n  Richard Stein, PhD          alchemyst@...\n        \n               The Japanese Sword Index\n    http://www.geocities.com/alchemyst/nihonto.htm\n    http://home.earthlink.net/~steinrl/nihonto.htm\n  ------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n        Yahoo!
