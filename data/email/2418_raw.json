My problem now is research.  Out of \nall my books (which is a fair number) I have only one reference to \nthis kind of weapon- in Arms and Armor of the Samurai by Hopson and \nBottomley.  If anyone out there can assist me in finding further \nreferences, pictures or other info I would sincerely appreciate it.\nThanks for your time.\nKirk\n\n\n\n\n"
