The silky feel and texture of the iron I am quite certain is due to the quality of the iron plate and the method of forging.  \n\nThe color I am not certain of.  \n\nNot all early tsuba even of good quality plate develop this purple color.  Some tend to go towards black and some towards brown.\n\nI know a tsuba collector who claims he can create this patina but the tsuba I have seen from him have fallen far short of the mark in my humble opinion.\n\nInteresting question.\n\nJohn\n\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: nihontochicken \n  To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Thursday, June 19, 2003 8:24 PM\n  Subject: [nihontostudy] Re: Iron Tsuba?\n\n\n  Lou and Folk -\n\n  Let me piggyback here.  The &quot;neatest&quot; iron tsuba I have seen \n  have &quot;wet, sticky, purplish black&quot; patina.  I doubt this is due only \n  to the properties of the base metal, but rather depend greatly on the \n  care and maintenance of the tsuba.  What is it that promotes this \n  type of patina?  Just so I can market the &quot;Chicken Brand Sticky \n  Purple Patina Paste&quot;.  ;o)\n\n  NC\n\n  --- In nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com, JapaneseSwords@a... wrote:\n  &gt; Can someone explain why many good iron tsuba are said to have a \n  purplish \n  &gt; patina?
