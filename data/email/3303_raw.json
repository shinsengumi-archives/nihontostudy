One fellow stated\nthat Sasano used &#39;a piece of carpet&#39; and joked that he\ncouldn&#39;t help it- it had become a minor vice.\n\nI am no where remotely near that point. By asking the\nquestion publically, I thought it might be\ninteresting.\n   Once in a blue moon, a tsuba comes up that deserves\nor demands that extra dimension of care. I&#39;m currently\ndeal with one that merits it, and it is also an odd\nshape that jeans care seems to do too much for the\nmimi and not enough for the face. Wondering if I face\n6 months to 1 year of flannel intensive care.\n   \nGlenn- &quot;Hands on&quot; is a must (eventually). All I read\nabout Yagyu tsuba could only take me so far until\nJim&#39;s lecture in San Fran. But until then- read till\nyour eyeballs pop out & learn many of the major kanji.\n   Still, under his q&a section on Jim G&#39;s website\nthere are pages upon pages of information. \n\nCurran\n\n--- Glenn &lt;oldsopplaya@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; John,\n&gt; \n&gt; It&#39;s not as bad as all that although I&#39;d love to\n&gt; pass\n&gt; off some of what I say as Tourette&#39;s.  :)  Nihonto\n&gt; may\n&gt; be a big shot in the arm or somewhere lower to get\n&gt; me\n&gt; going again.  :)\n&gt; \n&gt; All my interactions with nihontoites has been\n&gt; pleasant\n&gt; and there seems to be an unending desire to help.\n&gt; \n&gt; I just want those of you that have responded to my\n&gt; questions to know that I really appreciate it.\n&gt; \n&gt; Now I want Curran&#39;s question answered.\n&gt; \n&gt; Glenn\n&gt; \n&gt; --- &quot;Eliyas, John&quot; &lt;EliyasJ@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; And hopefully disability should not matter. \n&gt; &gt; Regardless if you are deaf, wheelchair bound or\n&gt; have\n&gt; &gt; frequent bouts of tourettes (how is that different\n&gt; &gt; from what occurs in the bar on the first night?) \n&gt; If\n&gt; &gt; you cannot hold a sword ask someone to bring it\n&gt; &gt; close.

Is there\n&gt; &gt; any\n&gt; &gt; &gt; place I can get more basic info other than books\n&gt; &gt; and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; web sites?  I read voraciously but have\n&gt; questions.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Glenn\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- Curran Campbell &lt;neobliviscar@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; List-\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Between intervals of carrying old iron tsuba\n&gt; in\n&gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; back jeans pocket to give them a slow polish,\n&gt; it\n&gt; &gt; has\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; been traditionally advised to give them a rub\n&gt; &gt; with\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; flannel. Over lots and lots of time, the\n&gt; flannel\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; thing\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; works... very slowly.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; _My main question_: what are the pros and cons\n&gt; &gt; of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; using non-dyed (aka homespun) denim /instead\n&gt; of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; flannel/ to rub the faces of the tsuba?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; _Secondary question_: In jeans pocket, it\n&gt; seems\n&gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mimi takes on too much polish while the face\n&gt; &gt; gets\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; only\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; slightly polished. What are the opinions of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; aesthetic\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; about this? Should degree of Mimi polish and\n&gt; &gt; face\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; polish be equal, or would Hagihara and other\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Japanese\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; authorities recommend more polish on the mimi\n&gt; &gt; and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; less\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; wear on the face especially the seppa dai\n&gt; area,\n&gt; &gt; as\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; would happen to a mounted tsuba over time as\n&gt; it\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; rubbed\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; against the silk/cotton of its owner&#39;s kimono?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Curran\n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?
