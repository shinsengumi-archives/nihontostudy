It depicts, on a polished copper \nground, Shoki mounted on a shishi.  The single image is rendered on \nboth surfaces in a skillful katakiri-bori, and is continuous across \nboth edges of the kodzuka.\n\nIt is inscribed on the reverse SOMIN with kao, and also bears the \ninscription GIONEN ROKUSU ROKUSAI (aged 66 years old).\n\nIt is ex the Peak and Gardiner collections, having been purchased by \nits previous owner in 1948.\n\nAny and all comments will be most gratefully received.\n\nRegards, JPL.\n\n\n\n"
