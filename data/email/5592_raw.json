I can \nsee the Ko Kinko attribution, and I have also seen Tachi-shi as an \nattribution (the book Kinko tsuba, small hardback in a series of three \nthat I forget the author off springs to mind)\n\nI have a killer flu at the moment so I will try and did some stuff up on \nthe weekend. It looks vaguely familiar except for the additional carving \nyou mentioned on the seppa dai.\n\nAnyway, as I sad, this is a great looking guard, I like it a lot.\n\ncheers\n\nRich\n\nallenbale wrote:\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt; Hi Rich,\n&gt; It is atp japaneseswordbooks.com new titles section\n&gt;\n&gt; Alan\n&gt;\n&gt; ----- Original Message -----\n&gt; From: Richard Turner\n&gt; To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com &lt;mailto:nihontostudy%40yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Wednesday, July 22, 2009 11:28 AM\n&gt; Subject: Re: [nihontostudy] Ni-mai Awase Tsuba\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi Alan, are there any images of the tsuba in question ?\n&gt;\n&gt; Cheers\n&gt;\n&gt; Richard\n&gt;\n&gt; Alan Bale wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The mention of san-mai awase tsuba reminds me of a tsuba I had\n&gt; &gt; recently, I would welcome the lists&#39; views regarding this piece, it is\n&gt; &gt; constructed of two thin yamagane plates soldered together, in fact the\n&gt; &gt; tsuba appears to be entirely constructed of metal cut from the same\n&gt; &gt; thin sheet as the very broad two piece rim covering half the plate\n&gt; &gt; seems to be of the same thickness.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I don&#39;t now have the tsuba so I can&#39;t give the size but I think the\n&gt; &gt; separate plates are each around 1.5mm thick, with a diameter of at\n&gt; &gt; least 8cm. From the colour of the metal I am guessing at a 16th\n&gt; &gt; century date although John Harding gave a Heian date to one in a\n&gt; &gt; catalogue he compiled! (One of the Sarzi-Amade selling catalogues).\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I think it possible that the maker was not a professional tsuba-ko as\n&gt; &gt; there is no reason to use such a complex construction method, the\n&gt; &gt; maker also does not seem to have a sense of the seppa-dai as a\n&gt; &gt; discrete area in itself, hence the curious decoration there that\n&gt; &gt; amazingly was applied before the nakago-ana was cut through.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Perhaps the makers of these tsuba were artisans who used this thin\n&gt; &gt; sheet yamagane for other purposes and saw a gap in the tsuba market.\n&gt; &gt; Does anyone know of other uses for this type of thin plate and\n&gt; &gt; decoration?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I have seen these illustrated in japanese books, the only one that\n&gt; &gt; comes immediately to mind is in Nihon Toban Zusetsu by Takezawa,\n&gt; &gt; probably by the same maker as mine, as the same defective spiral punch\n&gt; &gt; was used for both tsuba, Takezawa called it &#39;ko-kinko&#39; Any thoughts on\n&gt; &gt; this will be gratefully received.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Alan\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n&gt; ----------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Internal Virus Database is out-of-date.\n&gt; Checked by AVG.\n&gt; Version: 7.5.560 / Virus Database: 268.17.25/669 - Release Date: \n&gt; 2/4/2007 21:58\n&gt;\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n&gt; \n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
