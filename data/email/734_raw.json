In the depths of the Great \nDepression, the price of gold started to rise despite the \ndeflationary times.  A number of people sought the precious metal as \na solid store of value.  In 1933, FDR outlawed the private ownership \nof gold (which was called &quot;hoarding&quot; in the executive order - spin is \nno recent phenonemon!), and, after all the gold was sucked up by the \ngovernment for paper dollars, FDR devalued those dollars by re-\npegging the price of gold from $20.67 to $35 an ounce!  Here&#39;s the \nPresidential order:\n\nhttp://tinyurl.com/m8dg\n\nBTW, the order is still on the books, just temporarily rescinded, and \ncan be re-implemented at any time.  So if you believe that the Fed \nhas pumped too much money into the economy and roaring inflation is \naround the corner, and have bought gold to hedge this, be aware that \nthe gubbermint is ready, willing and able to yank your life preserver \naway.  Too bad, so sad, glub-glub-glub!\n\nNC\n\n\n"
