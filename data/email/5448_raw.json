When I got it it had a nice solid\nbrown patina, but enough =\r\nrust scaling to need cleaning with a wirewheel.\n\nPics are here-\nhttp://ph.g=\r\nroups.yahoo.com/group/nihontostudy/photos/browse/e85a\n\nAny thoughts would b=\r\ne greatly appreciated.  Not looking to sell it,\njust info on period, school=\r\n, maker, etc... :)\n\nThanks!\n\nA.W.\n\n\n\n\n\n"
