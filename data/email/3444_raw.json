Just about everthing else in print and\nelectronic media reported &quot;samurai sword&quot;.  See for example:\n\nhttp://abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200511/s1495995.htm\nhttp://www.theage.com.au/news/national/doubt-over-charges-after-burglar-killed-w\nith-sword/2005/11/02/1130823281025.html\n\nWithin a couple of days there was another &quot;samurai sword&quot; attack on the other\nside of Melbourne:\nhttp://www.news.com.au/story/0,10117,17146188-29277,00.html\n\nHere is a bulletin board thread discussing a case in the UK that may be of\ninterest, seeing this issue appears to be well on the way to becoming a\nworld-wide phenomenon:\nhttp://timlambert.org/2004/03/gullible/\n\nFrom the few photos I&#39;ve seen of the incident David Zincavage refers to the\nsword looks like a repro of some sort - it&#39;s gunto-like but the tsuba is just\ntoo brilliantly gold for it to be a real one.  In a couple of months or so I&#39;ll\nbe retired and I intend to follow up on these with the police to identify all\nthe swords involved in &quot;samurai sword&quot; attacks here in Victoria leading up to\nthe infamous, ignorant and outrageous laws that we are well aware of.  John&#39;s\nemail (excelsiorilluminati@...) spoke of:\n\n&gt; These attacks on people with &#39;Samurai Swords&#39; are\n&gt; the exact reason there has been legislation enacted\n&gt; already with more being contemplated in certain parts\n&gt; of the world.\n\nMore information please.  I think my home state of Victoria here in Oz was the\nfirst in the West to introduce laws as a direct result of &quot;samurai sword&quot;\nattacks, and we have heard of the Scottish move.  Anything else??  Any more\ndetails??  Perhaps it might be better to reply to me offline in this\n&quot;developmental&quot; stage??  We can take the list&#39;s time and bandwidth in the event\nof concrete actions by legislators.  OR - keep the discussion online until\nsomeone complains??  Personally I&#39;m &#39;red-hot&#39; on somehow correcting the\nignorance of our legislature here in Victoria as well as the media.  Not sure\nhow I&#39;ll go about a one-man, retired old geezer moral minority campaign gainst\nabysmal ignorance, but once retired I&#39;ll have &#39;the rest of my life&#39; to get into\nit...\n\nBest regards,\n\nBarry Thomas\n(Melbourne, Australia)\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &quot;David Zincavage&quot; &lt;jdz@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;token_kenkyu_kai@...&gt;; &lt;nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Saturday, November 05, 2005 6:30 AM\nSubject: Anybody in Oz know what kind of sword?\n\n\nhttp://www.news.com.au/story/0,10117,17114699-421,00.html\n\n"
