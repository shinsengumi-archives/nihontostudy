Since\nthis could be anything and not likely for sale, I think we will all agree\nthat the chances of this being of any interest were pretty slim.  Surprise,\nit turned out to b a relatively clean wakizashi in a nice old shira-saya.\nThe blade was signed Fujishima Tomoshige, I assume one of the late\nkoto/very early Shinto Kaga smiths of that line - tight itame with a\nkomidare. A sword.\n      Perhaps the most interesting thing about the sword was a rectangular\numegane set into the shinogi-ji in the monouchi. It measured maybe 1/4&quot; by\n1/2&quot; and was clearly visible. It had not fully removed the flaw since there\nwas a clear fukure on its edge.\n      My question to the List is whether on not this kind of umegane is\ngood or bad. Well, it can hardly be &quot;good,&quot; right? There was a flaw there,\nbut an umegane must be better than a flaw, right? Does an umegane detract\nfrom or enhance the value of a sword?  And how visible should an umegane\nbe?  Is the fact that this plug was clearly visible - and square! - mean\nthat it was poorly done?\n      Peter Bleed\n\n\n\n\n"
