I believe the owner made a substitution (he had\nonly so many slots and given me more items than he had\nslots). Same owner as the Myochin.\n\nThe design is exactly the same as Rich&#39;s, but it did\nnot feel Akasaka. The mimi on Akasaka usually feels\nmore full, rounded. Then the actual plate on the tsuba\nwas ~perfectly~ flat and the sukashi so crisp in\nexecution that it felt almost machined precise in\nexecution.\n    I mentally ruled out Akasaka, and was curious to\nsee the shinsa results on it. The fact that I don&#39;t\nwould point towards either (a) early senility or (b)\nthat this was the one substituted out.\n\nJim, (sidenote) at the time I was surprised at the\nMyochin call on the other tsuba. I would have thought\nthat it ended up in some group I was less familiar\nwith. Interesting tsuba.\n\nAny preview on the Yagyu exhibit for those\ninternational listeroos that won&#39;t get to see it?\n\nCurran\n\n\n\n--- Jim Gilbert &lt;jggilbert@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; Curran,\n&gt; Number 482 was a Myochin tsuba with a circular cross\n&gt; section rim and a design of two large diamond shapes\n&gt; at 12:00 and 6:00.  That&#39;s the only thing similar in\n&gt; your group.  I know the owner, so I&#39;m guessing it&#39;s\n&gt; the one you&#39;re thinking of.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ve seen the spiral motif used on a guard signed\n&gt; Tadatoki, and as Rich said the insect is often seen\n&gt; in Akasaka sukashi.  I don&#39;t think Akasaka is a bad\n&gt; call. \n&gt; \n&gt; Rich, what&#39;s putting you off Akasaka?\n&gt; \n&gt; Back to the Yagyu,\n&gt;  Jim\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   Rich,\n&gt; \n&gt;   At the Chicago 2004 NTHK Shinsa, I papered a near\n&gt;   identical (very pristine condition) tsuba for a\n&gt;   friend. I do not remember what the attribution\n&gt; was-\n&gt;   but I know it was not Akasaka.\n&gt; \n&gt;   I do not know if Jim G. has easy access to those\n&gt;   records, but I believe the tsuba was somewhere\n&gt; between\n&gt;   the submissions # 460 to 485.\n&gt; \n&gt;   Jim can probably identify it out of hand, but I\n&gt;   thought you might also appreciate the Hagihara\n&gt; notes\n&gt;   on the similar tsuba.\n&gt; \n&gt;   Curran\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been\n&gt; removed]\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n\n\t\t\n____________________________________________________\nStart your day with Yahoo! - make it your home page \nhttp://www.yahoo.com/r/hs \n \n\n"
