Also maybe there is another\nplace to host pictures like RichT? (Isn&#39;t that nice of\nme to volunteer Rich&#39;s site).  The only reason I say\nthis is just like there are sites where you can look\nup the pattern of steel for sword to kantei, why\ncouldn&#39;t we do the same with the pics of tsuba just as\nyou have done.  I know not all tsuba have them, but\nstill would help peg down school.  SO many projects\nout there.  Anyway, thanks again.\nKen\n\n--- Jim Gilbert &lt;jggilbert@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; Ken,\n&gt; Good, glad it helped.  I plan to update the photos\n&gt; on my site and will include images of rims where\n&gt; there is something to see.  Given storage and\n&gt; bandwidth limitations I will probably have to get\n&gt; rid of the pieces that I don&#39;t have any longer so\n&gt; that I can focus on the best examples.  \n&gt; \n&gt; The technical aspects of tekkotsu are far from\n&gt; settled.  The quote that Pete posted from the\n&gt; Solingen catalog is an interesting one.  I don&#39;t\n&gt; know whether that is how tekkotsu were formed in the\n&gt; Muromachi period.  I have read hypotheses crediting\n&gt; everything from the source of the ore onward for\n&gt; being the cause of tekkotsu.  There is even an idea\n&gt; that the bones were not even visible in the original\n&gt; piece but are only revealed over time due to the\n&gt; corrosion and/or wear resistance of the higher\n&gt; carbon regions.  I doubt that that&#39;s entirely true,\n&gt; but it is a factor for guards with condition\n&gt; problems -- the tekkotsu will stand out.\n&gt; \n&gt; Jim\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   Jim,\n&gt; \n&gt;   Excellent, while of course I would love to handle\n&gt;   them,  these pictures are the next best thing. \n&gt; Great\n&gt;   stuff and makes it clearer.  If someone had the\n&gt; time,\n&gt;   it would be great to put these up on\n&gt; your/someone&#39;s\n&gt;   website.  All these sites devoted to swords, could\n&gt; use\n&gt;   some more to tsuba.  Would love to see tekkotsu\n&gt;   website depicting various schools.\n&gt; \n&gt;   Now for the next question- why so different? \n&gt; metal\n&gt;   used? folding techniques?  when forming the mimi\n&gt; what\n&gt;   steps would they do (I know big questions)?\n&gt; \n&gt;   Thanks- as always you are extremely helpful.\n&gt;   Ken\n&gt;   &#92;\n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been\n&gt; removed]\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?
