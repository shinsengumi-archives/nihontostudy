I&#39;ve found that both in Japan and the US.  It is certainly a multi-variable issue, though.\n\nHow and why tsuba sizes vary over time is a very interesting and complex question.\n\nJim\n\n\n\n  While I agree with Arnold&#39;s points, I would suspect \n  that given two tsuba of equal quality the larger would\n  likely bring bigger bucks. Just the Western hangup \n  that bigger is better.\n\n  As for why smaller on some earlier tsuba, I suspect just\n  a matter of style of the period. A tsuba should (?) balance\n  a blade somewhat (although the effect may be only slight\n  if at all), so as blade shapes, lengths and weights changed,\n  so would tsuba size. Just my uneducated opinion on the topic.\n\n  Rich\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
