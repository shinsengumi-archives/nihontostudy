Normally that sort of  punching was done to spread the metal out laterally (to shrink the nakago-ana), so nothing would be broken away or gouged out.  This case is pretty extreme and to no obvious effect, but still, removing iron isn&#39;t difficult and the holes wouldn&#39;t be much help as far as I can imagine.  Iron is soft and it looks like the holes were drilled after the punching.  It strikes me as some later fiddling to mount it on something, but who knows.\n\nThe design is weights, not axe heads, btw (not your idea, I know).  The Japanese tool for splitting bamboo looks like a broken off sword (no kisaki).  A friend of mine from Higashi Hiroshima comes from a farming family and their bamboo knife is in fact a broken Masahide sword with a nice mei.\n\nJim\n\n\n\n  All, in this tsuba ( Owari or Kyo Shoami maybe ?? ) in the punch marks \n  on the face, are 3 distinct pin holes or drill holes. Are these to \n  enable the metal to be broken away easier when punching out the iron ?. \n  Seems reasonable.\n\n  http://www.l-wise.co.jp/sword/sdata43/egk251-02.jpg\n\n  http://www.l-wise.co.jp/sword/sdata43/egk251-05.jpg\n\n  http://www.l-wise.co.jp/sword/sdata43/egk251-04.jpg\n\n  Any thoughts welcome.\n\n  Cheers\n\n  rich\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
