Doesn&#39;t that\nplay an important role as well ?\n \nI read in a piece by R. B. Caldwell that since the kamakura tachis were\nso well balanced by themselves (he described them as prima donnas haha) \n \nthey really only needed a light lacquered leather guard. \n \nSo it stands to reason that the Nambokucho massive swords that had\nlittle fumbari were no where near as well balanced and must have needed\nmassive tsuba to match ??\n \nOr small ones that were 2.5 inches wide and 1 inch thick of course\nhahaha\n \n- Matt \n\n-----Oorspronkelijk bericht-----\nVan: Richard Turner [mailto:ikkanshi@...] \nVerzonden: donderdag 24 april 2003 6:16\nAan: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com\nOnderwerp: Re: [nihontostudy] EXCELLENT!!! and startin&#39; off with a\nquestion...\n\n\nThis is an interesting topic, I have just been lent The Picture Book of\nOld Tsuba by Robert Burawoy to read and enjoy and there are several of\nthese \nvery tsuba in this book. I remember reading that the tsuba size changed\nwhen fighting went from one handed mounted to two handed ground\nfighting. There are several nice smaller cast pieces in this book that\nare from the nambokucho period. There is also a very nice red lacquer\nthat was a used by certain Priests I believe that loos spectacular. I\nwill research this more later in the day and respond with proper\ninformation.\n\ncheers\n\nRich Turner\n\n\n---\nOutgoing mail is certified Virus Free.\nChecked by AVG anti-virus system (http://www.grisoft.com).\nVersion: 6.0.471 / Virus Database: 269 - Release Date: 10/04/2003\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\nYahoo!
