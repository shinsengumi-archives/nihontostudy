Even if it would be=\r\n\nbetter..it is not how the artist intended it to be. The swords were\nonce m=\r\nade for battle...but now they are universally considered art. \nWe collector=\r\ns are always striving to get swords that are as close as\npossible to how th=\r\ney were originally  manufactured. Yes...suriage is\ntolerated...but not pref=\r\nered. It is accepted because it cannot be\nundone. No-one here would have an=\r\n old sword shortened because they\nthink it would look better that way. \nAdd=\r\ning hi may not be noticable, but it is not the chosen action by\nanyone exce=\r\npt yourself..and since we are preserving these swords for\nfuture generation=\r\ns...I just feel it is selfish to change it. The next\ngeneration may want it=\r\n shortened..the next will add a horimono..and\nafter a few generations what =\r\nwas a nice Shinto sword becomes another\nback-of-the-cupboard relic. None of=\r\n this can be undone, and the fact\nthat others may do it does not make it th=\r\ne correct action.\n\nJust my 2c on behapf of future generations looking for o=\r\nriginal Nihonto.\n\nBrian\n\n\n--- In nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com, Enore Gardon=\r\nio &lt;egardon@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Its a Shinto blade not Koto. If I do put the hi=\r\n on it will not be for \n&gt; whistling purposes. What makes people think that =\r\nI would shallowly ruin \n&gt; an old blade. I see no reason why the blade canno=\r\nt be used for Iaido\nand \n&gt; adding a hi on it does not ruin the blade, if do=\r\nne by a proper smith in \n&gt; Japan. The blade can still be appreciated. We ar=\r\ne obviously looking at \n&gt; this from opposite ends. If done correctly and I =\r\npresented you with the \n&gt; blade for the first time you would probably not k=\r\nnow that it was\nmodified.\n&gt; Enore\n&gt; \n\n\n\n"
