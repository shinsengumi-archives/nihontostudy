The reason for its rarity is simple.  All \nthe spare copies were stored in a leaking compartment and most of the \nremainders were destroyed.  There just are not that many copies \naround.  Nos. 1 and 10 are all gone from my stock but they were \npopular and are being hoarded someplace.  The true scarce one is No. \n5.  I had fifty copies reprinted and they are all gone as well.  You \ncan recognize them because they have a soft paper cover instead of \nthe coated stock.\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
