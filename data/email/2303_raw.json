Looks like someone that was \nat the show is busting your balls.  If they are from Chicago then they must be \npart of your local sword study group possibly.  I seem to remember that \nsomeone on this list knew that you had left your sword in the shinza room.  I think \nsomeone on this list must know what is going on, but would rather see you \nsquirm for a bit.  Good luck on finding out who it is.\n\nLou\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
