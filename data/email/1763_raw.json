Given \nthe style of the plate and shape and the angle of the kozuka ana (the \noval opening) it may be as old as the late Muromachi to Momoyama \nperiod (late 16th C).  Given the style of raised rim, it would \nprobably be designated as a Katchushi (armor maker&#39;s) tsuba, although \nthat is more a convenient term than a literal truth.  It&#39;s a nicely \nproportioned and apparently well made guard, although simple.  It \nlooks like there is black lacquer on a lot of the surface.\n&gt; \n&gt; The style of the dragon on the other tsuba is typical for Echizen \nKinai work from the mid to late Edo period.  It&#39;s often seen in \nlarger tsuba, but less common in tanto guards.  Given the soft detail \nand the look of the seppa dai (the central flat oval) it might be \ncast.  I can&#39;t tell for sure from the photos.  \n&gt; \n&gt; What does the rest of the mounting with the older guard look like?\n&gt; \n&gt; Jim\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   Hi\n&gt; \n&gt;   i made a trade a did get two &quot;Tantos&quot;, can anyone tell me \nsomething \n&gt;   about the tsubas that were mounted on them, se pics under photos \n&gt;   Tsubas2.jpg , would be nice to now age or something on them\n&gt; \n&gt;   Best Regards\n&gt; \n&gt;   Patrik\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
