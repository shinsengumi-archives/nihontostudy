That would be a 100\npoint koshirae.\n\nEach deviation from that state has a corresponding point reduction.\n\nI agree with Gordon&#39;s comments about preservation standards and practices in\nJapan and I believe that foreign collectors should understand and apply\nthese standards to their own practice.  This approach tends to keep the\ndimensions I outlined above in balance.\n\nUnfortunately, a lot of koshirae submitted to the overseas shinsa have these\ndimensions knocked out of balance due to overzealous restoration,\nreplacement or outright fabrication.\n\nThere isn&#39;t a formula for this, so I will provide some anecdotes that I\nthink will get the general idea across.\n\n- The biggest upsets seem to result from newly built koshirae.  An owner\nwill collect a group of old fittings, sometimes of very nice quality, and\nhave a koshirae made up with a new saya and tsuka foundation.  This will not\npass shinsa and the owner will be unhappy, particularly when he sees\noriginal koshirae with fittings that are not nearly as nice as his pass with\nabove average point values. \n\n- These other koshirae can have very plain fittings that on their own would\nnot even be seen as being collectible by most.  However, when they are all\noriginal and in good condition they can do quite well as a koshirae, often\nto the surprise of their owners who thought the mount was nothing special\nbecause the fittings weren&#39;t fancy.\n\n- An otherwise original, good looking koshirae with a newly made saya will\nfail.\n\n- An original koshirae with a refinished old saya will suffer a major point\nreduction.  If the mount is otherwise fairly good and well preserved, the\nrefinished saya will probably drive it into the shinteisho point range\n(60-69).  If the mount is not so good, the saya can drive it below 60 points\nwhich translates to failing shinsa.  An &quot;auto body&quot; job on a saya will\nalmost certainly drag any koshirae below 60 points.\n\n- A slightly damaged but original saya will suffer a point reduction, but\nprobably not as big a one as a new or badly restored one will.  Too much\ndamage can pull the piece into the shinteisho or failing range.\n\n- A new tsuka foundation, while less obvious than a new saya, will fail.\n\n- Same that is obviously new will result in a major point reduction, but in\npractice is usually accompanied by enough additional poor &quot;restoration&quot; to\nresult in failure.\n\n- It is a plus to keep old tsuka ito (mid Edo or older) intact, even if it\nis damaged or dirty.  Clumsy recent tsuka ito work will result in a\nsignificant point reduction.  Good quality recent tsuka ito work is a lesser\nreduction.  I personally believe that destroying an older wrap is a very bad\npractice, but at shinsa there is no way to know what was removed before the\nnew wrap was applied.  A koshirae that should have tsuka ito but does not\nhave it will usually fail.\n\n- Missing kurikata, koiguchi, etc. will result in a point reduction.  Badly\nrestored kurikata, koiguchi, etc., will also result in a point reduction.\nOnes restored to professional Japanese standards are generally overlooked.\n\n- A missing kozuka or kogai where there should be one will result in a point\nreduction, as will one inappropriate to the koshirae.  A gimei kozuka or\nkogai will result in failure of the koshirae, although it is usually\npossible to certify the koshirae excluding that fitting.  \n\n- A koshirae with gimei or reproduction tsuba, menuki,  fuchigashira or any\nfitting that cannot be excluded will fail.\n\n- An original sageo is a slight plus.  A missing or modern one is ignored.\n\n- Missing seppa tend to be overlooked, but ill-fitting western ones are\nworse than none. \n\n- In general minor repairs done to high quality Japanese standards will be\noverlooked, but ones done poorly and/or in non-Japanese standards will be\ndowngraded.\n\n- Put-together koshirae from old saya and tsuka will fail if detected...\nand they are detected.\n\n- Restoration work that is good enough to escape detection will escape\ndetection.\n\nJim\n\n\n\n\n  Jim, care to comment?\n\n\n\n  Gordon\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYahoo!
