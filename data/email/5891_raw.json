In some cases I still may have &quot;want lists&quot; from clients who are\n&gt; still looking for certain books, and I&#39;m glad to do what I can to put\n&gt; people and books together - that was the real thrill of bookselling.\n&gt;\n&gt; Dean, in most cases a photo of the cover will be enough for identification,\n&gt; though in some cases a shot of the colophon page with the publication\n&gt; information will be needed where there are significant differences between\n&gt; editions.\n&gt;\n&gt; The email list(s) are decidedly not the best place to offer books like\n&gt; these. I don&#39;t know what the subscriber counts are, but the nearly complete\n&gt; lack of traffic tells the story. The Nihonto Message Board is where the\n&gt; action and the collectors are, for the most part.\n&gt;\n&gt; I did close my business for health reasons, and my remaining Asia-related\n&gt; stock is being handled by Paragon Books, but I recently found a few\n&gt; &quot;stragglers&quot; that I&#39;ll be offering on NMB. I&#39;m in the process of moving\n&gt; over the next month or so to smaller, rented, quarters, but I&#39;m still alive\n&gt; and interested and willing to help out wherever I can. I recently put\n&gt; together a Hawley&#39;s offered there with someone I knew who had been looking\n&gt; for a copy.\n&gt;\n&gt; Dean or anyone can drop me a line or call,\n&gt;\n&gt; Craig\n&gt; bridgeofdreams@...\n&gt; 847-846-7701 (cell)\n&gt;\n&gt; On Fri, Nov 25, 2011 at 11:32 AM, sigp210 &lt;sigp210@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; **\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Curran,\n&gt; &gt; Don&#39;t you think it might be a good idea to get hold of Craig from the\n&gt; &gt; Ex-Bridge of Dreams? Although he was recently forced to close his Nihonto\n&gt; &gt; Book business, I am sure he is still very good at suggesting prices and\n&gt; &gt; would know most of the books. Might even be able to assist with moving\n&gt; many\n&gt; &gt; of them or be able to advise.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Brian\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- In nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com, Curran Campbell &lt;neobliviscar@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Dean,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Though I was not introduced to your father until late in life, he and I\n&gt; &gt; had two wonderful discussions on Bizen blades.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I hope his books go to excellent homes.
