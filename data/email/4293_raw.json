It is a beautiful\n&gt; Mino\n&gt;   &gt; Shakudo Tsuba. I believe the kogai ana is filled\n&gt;   &gt; with\n&gt;   &gt; copper. It has nice nanako. The edge is\n&gt; completely\n&gt;   &gt; filled with leaves and flowers,etc. The only\n&gt; really\n&gt;   &gt; weird thing is that the seppa-dai must have be\n&gt; put\n&gt;   &gt; on\n&gt;   &gt; a pole weapon or something. It has notches put\n&gt; in\n&gt;   &gt; and\n&gt;   &gt; the nakaga ana has been widened. Questions,\n&gt; where\n&gt;   &gt; would you classify this? I was thinking mid-edo,\n&gt; \n&gt;   &gt; but\n&gt;   &gt; what would you look for in ko-mino work? I have\n&gt;   &gt; been\n&gt;   &gt; looking for a piece like this for a long time\n&gt; and I\n&gt;   &gt; think I did well on the purchase. Comments\n&gt; please\n&gt;   &gt; (good and bad). \n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nhttp://w25.photobucket.com/widgets/dynamicflash.php?featuretype=bucketstrip&featurename=Minotsuba&pa=/c52/kamakiri/Mino/\n&gt;   &gt; Double click on scrolling picture to view more\n&gt;   &gt; detailed photo.
