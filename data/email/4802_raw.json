My interest is\nin fittings, so I agree with Barry in that the fuchi\n(and probably the kashira too) looks interesting. We&#39;d\nlove to see more photographs, if possible. Just be\ngentle with the tsuka (handle), but don&#39;t be afraid of\nit.\n\nThe nakago (tang) of the sword isn&#39;t signed, but does\nhold some promise at first glance. If you can take a\nwhole shot of the nakago, it would be most beneficial\nto the sword guys on the list.\n   Is Harry Watson on this list? Any chance you will\nbe in Dallas this year at the gunshow she mentioned?\n\nCurran\n\n--- Richard Turner &lt;ikkanshi@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; Hi Becky, it would be great to see the whole Nakago\n&gt; ( tang ) as the \n&gt; sword looks Suriage, and maybe O Suriage ( greatly\n&gt; shortened )\n&gt; \n&gt; Sorry to ask, but you love hard work :-) can you\n&gt; supply an image of the \n&gt; whole tang ?\n&gt; \n&gt; Cheers\n&gt; \n&gt; Rich\n&gt; \n&gt; BECKY WALLACE wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; OK, with your encouragement, I have disassembled\n&gt; my sword, taken \n&gt; &gt; pictures and posted them in my folder &quot;Becky&#39;s\n&gt; Sword&quot;. They are the \n&gt; &gt; last 5 pictures in the folder. If the sword blade\n&gt; is signed it appears \n&gt; &gt; to be with a single character that looks something\n&gt; like a Y. It isn&#39;t \n&gt; &gt; very clear and the pictures aren&#39;t very good, but\n&gt; if anyone can tell \n&gt; &gt; anything, I&#39;d sure like to know it.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Thanks,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Becky\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; bungotakadasword &lt;MuramasaIII@...\n&gt; &lt;mailto:MuramasaIII%40aol.com&gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; --- In nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n&gt; &gt; &lt;mailto:nihontostudy%40yahoogroups.com&gt;, BECKY\n&gt; WALLACE &lt;SNDE92BW@...&gt; \n&gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Wow, I can&#39;t believe it. The scan you put in my\n&gt; folder. The one\n&gt; &gt; top left is identical to mine. Same crickets. And\n&gt; the signature is\n&gt; &gt; identical to the one someone posted as a mino. So\n&gt; now I know about the\n&gt; &gt; tsuba. So what about the sword? Is the maker of\n&gt; the sword and the\n&gt; &gt; tsuba generally completely different people?\n&gt; schools? are they\n&gt; &gt; totally disassociated or might there be some\n&gt; swordsmiths that tended to\n&gt; &gt; use tsubas from this particular school?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Becky\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; based on your pic # 4........... all you have to\n&gt; do is remove that wood\n&gt; &gt; peg ( behind the fuchi ) and the whole &quot; handle &quot;\n&gt; will come off and you\n&gt; &gt; can take pics.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I labelled it &quot; mino &quot; because I put it with a\n&gt; Mino sword.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; milt\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been\n&gt; removed]\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been\n&gt; removed]\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?
