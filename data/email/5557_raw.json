Looking at examples of Nobuiye work, this motif does frequently appear on his tsuba. Has anyone ever found reference to WHY this motif was so often used by Nobuiye? Does it relate to something that was particularly meaningful to Nobuiye? Does anyone ever recall reading anything on this? It would seem doubtful that it was used simply because it was a pleasing pattern to adorn tsuba. \n\nRon\nSTL\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
