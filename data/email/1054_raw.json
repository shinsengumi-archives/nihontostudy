One thought I have is that the kashira\nwas originally the kojiri, I feel the shape would make more sense this way.\nAltogether a puzzling item. There is no bare wood visible.\nRegarding another tsuba, if you have Sotheby&#39;s London catalogue of 11\nNovember lot 27 is a Soten tsuba with a Hozon paper, the item is clearly\n19th century and a long time after the 2nd Soten, any ideas?\nAlan\n\n\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &quot;Jim Gilbert&quot; &lt;jggilbert@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Thursday, November 13, 2003 12:56 AM\nSubject: Re: [nihontostudy] Re: anyone for a piece at auction\n\n\n: Ray,\n: I think that it&#39;s a legitimate Japanese koshirae, although the bare wood\nparts are apparently replacements to fill in the &quot;blanks.&quot;  It&#39;d be hard to\ncobble together something with such an unusual shape to the saya, tsuka and\nkashira.  The shape and the suspension ring remind me of toppei koshirae\nfrom Bakumatsu.  The catalog entry claims that the fittings are decorated in\nuttori, which if correct would suggest a much earlier date.  I can&#39;t tell\nfrom the photo whether the ring might be a later modification.  Without\nhaving seen it in person all I can do is speculate.  It&#39;s unusual enough\nthat even after seeing it I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if I was still stuck.\n:\n: Alan (or anyone else who might have seen it (or now owns it)), any ideas?\nThis is the lot illustrated as 253, but described under 251.\n:\n: Jim\n:\n:\n:\n:   Hi Jim, thanks for the background. If not Ainu, I am very curious\n:   what the origin of a koshirae like this would be. Perhaps someone\n:   simply cobbled this together from the fragments of other koshirae?\n:   Or, maybe this piece originated outside of Japan.
