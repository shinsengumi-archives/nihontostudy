Sword books and\n&gt;kodogu references tend to follow simple rules and if you learn to\n&gt;recognize a handful of &quot;signpost&quot; kanji you&#39;ll be able to navigate\n&gt;them and glean much of the info.\n&gt;       With sword signatures saku or tsukuru are usually preceeded\n&gt;by the two characters of the smiths name (you&#39;ll need O&#39;neill).\n&gt;Kuni,ju and (no)Kami are preceeded by place names, usually two\n&gt;characters (in the Nelson indecies). The character shu is usually\n&gt;part of the &quot;Chinese&quot; name of a province (also found in the Nelson\n&gt;indecies). nen, tsuki,hi(jitsu) and dai are usually preceeded by\n&gt;numbers, the year, month, day and generation respectively. Of course\n&gt;nen can follow a zodaiacal character like year of the rat, year of\n&gt;the tiger, (these characters are also found in the indecies).\n&gt;       Most descriptions follow sugata, jigane, hamon, nakago and\n&gt;background. It is in the background that one can get lost as these\n&gt;are usually given in regular Japanese, not &quot;swordspeak.&quot; Even then if\n&gt;you can learn to recognize dai, jidai, nen, kuni, den, (ryu)ha,\n&gt;deshi, and mon, you can get a lot out of what seem undecipherable\n&gt;paragraphs. Mon by the way means gate, Masatsune mon would translate\n&gt;&quot;Masatsune school&quot;, as in &quot;he studied within the gate of Masatsune&quot;\n&gt;or &quot;in the Masatsune school&quot;. Often rendered as &quot;student of&quot; it can\n&gt;mean that he may not have been a direct student but was a product of\n&gt;that group, if it was a large school or the relationship isn&#39;t clear.\n&gt;       For tsuba the signatures follow similar rules though one\n&gt;encounters a wider use of GO or art names. Regular dictionaries don&#39;t\n&gt;really help there, I suggest Haynes or the Kinko Meikan. The\n&gt;descriptions usually follow Subject, shape, plate, engraving and\n&gt;inlay. So look for zu,sugata,ita,hori and zogan, knowing the terms\n&gt;from glossaries you&#39;ll quickly start to recognize the kanji as they\n&gt;are repeated in many listings.\n&gt;       In general I think reading swordspeak, learning to read\n&gt;swordspeak is easy, learn the hiragana and a handful of kanji and you\n&gt;can get a lot out of those books. Please bear in mind I type all this\n&gt;not for you as I am sure you know much of this already, rather it is\n&gt;intended for those the list that might be having similar troubles...\n&gt;-t\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;To manage your options for this group:\n&gt;\n&gt;Post message: nihonto@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;Subscribe:  nihonto-subscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;Unsubscribe:  nihonto-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;Nihonto group website: \n&gt;&lt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/nihonto&gt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/nihonto\n&gt;\n&gt;Remember: Honor is your most important attribute!\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;YAHOO!
