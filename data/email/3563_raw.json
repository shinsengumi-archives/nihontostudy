Is this incorrect ?. I would have thought that with \ntechnological advances, another 200 years or so of study and probably \naccess to more material, we would have the best books available to us \nnow. I would also imagine that any books written with authority in those \ndays would be rare and worth a lot of money.\n\nAnd I don&#39;t know why, but I imagine all the good data is on scrolls. \nLOL, too many movies maybe ?\n.\ncheers\n\nRich.\n\n\nbungotakadasword wrote:\n\n&gt;http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=6583734408\n&gt;\n&gt;Jim, Gordon et  al,\n&gt;this kind of old book &quot; reliable &quot; ?\n&gt;\n&gt;Milt\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;Yahoo!
