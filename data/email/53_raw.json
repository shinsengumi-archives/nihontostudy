From early koshirae I have seen, katana are mounted with kogai only, kozuka and kogai, or neither.  I have not seen a katana mounted with only a kozuka.\n\nWakizashi are very commonly mounted with only a kozuka, but are also seen with kozuka and kogai.\n\nThe two files in the nihontostudy website File section include columns to indicate the kozuka and kogai configuration for each mounting in the Katana Koshirae catalog.\n\nWe see a fair number of 8+ cm tsuba around with a kozuka ana cut in them...  were they really big wakizashi tsuba, were katana mounted with kozuka only at some point or was the ana used for a kogai, despite the kozuka shape?  I don&#39;t know.  There is one wakizashi koshirae in the spread sheet with an 8.6 cm tsuba, so that might be the explanation.\n\nI&#39;ll come back to this later.\n\nJim\n\n\n  Ken -\n\n  Presence of kogai and kozuka ana are maybe part of the\n  story. I asked Jim a similar question and as I understood\n  his reply (perhaps he will elaborate); katana tsuba\n  normally have both kozuka and kogai ana or either\n  while wakizashi tsuba normally only have a kozuka ana.\n  Although there are numerous exceptions; small sukashi\n  tsuba which to my eye are obviously for a wakizashi\n  based on size not uncommonly have both. Also many\n  of the very early tosho and katchushi tsuba had\n  only one (many had been added later). I hope I haven&#39;t\n  done too much damage to what Jim had said. I&#39;m sure\n  he will fill in the blanks.\n\n  Rich\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
