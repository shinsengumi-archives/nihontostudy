It is 46mm x\n&gt; 29mm oval metal disk with Japanese writing on both sides.  I not sure\n&gt; which side is the obverse or which way is up.  I&#39;ve had it for 40 years\n&gt; and have never been able to satisfy my curiosity.  I even showed it to a\n&gt; Japanese tourist once and all he could tell me that it is a military\n&gt; script that is not taught anymore.  I&#39;ve attached a copy to this e-mail.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks in advance,\n&gt;\n&gt; Dave Wilber\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
