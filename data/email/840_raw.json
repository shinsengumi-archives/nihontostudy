Then I realized that it was signed which made me wonder (and my question to you all) if you find Momoyama era fittings very often signed? Well, I guess you do but if so, I have seen very few that were signed. This led me to wonder if this set was really that early or what. Looking in Haynes&#39; books I do not see a Muneyoshi (kao) referenced--without kao, yes, but none with kao. Could read Soyoshi, sokichi...maybe something totally different?  Hopefully the links will work (in Yahoo pictures) and if so, I would appreciate any comments that you may have as to when these were made and what era. (apologies for the poor photo...mei is fine, though.)\n\n  http://tinyurl.com/p40k\n\n  http://tinyurl.com/p40v\n\n  Any help or impressions or comments...all appreciated.\n\n  Ron\n  STL\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
