Be that as it may, let me in=\r\nterject two self-learned Chicken\ntruths about rust:\n\n1. It&#39;s always worse t=\r\nhan it looks.  If there is ANY surface\ndiscoloration (red, black, gray, eve=\r\nn white), then there is pitting. \nMore a problem, of course, on blades as o=\r\npposed to tsuba.  But any\nrusting of any kind means more than just finger s=\r\ntones on blades to\ncorrect the damage.  I have not the experience on kodogu=\r\n to say\nsomething even semi-intelligent, but suspect that if any discolorat=\r\nion\nis removed, the surface will not be as smooth as when first made,\nunles=\r\ns considerable nearby unrusted metal is removed as well.\n\n2. When there is =\r\nscabby red/brown rust on blades, the pitting is kinda\nbad to extremely bad,=\r\n and it&#39;s difficult to impossible to tell simply\nby looking which it is.  T=\r\nhis Chicken truism comes from polishing\n(&quot;Forgive me, God, for I have sinne=\r\nd&quot;) two Pacific Era gunto with\nequivalent scabby surface rust.  Paradoxical=\r\nly, on the the traditional\ntamahagane (no stamps) gunto, the rust pits went=\r\n to China, in depth\nthey were as long or longer than their width.  I couldn=\r\n&#39;t get out all\nthe pitting without grinding away over three hundred years w=\r\north of\nmetal, and had ot give up with about five percent of the pits\nremai=\r\nning.  On the non-traditional, Seki-stamped gunto (Kumemune\nmentioned a whi=\r\nle ago), though the surface rust was essentially\nidentical, the pits were n=\r\no where near as deep, and, as it turned out,\nnot deeper than the waves in t=\r\nhe crap wartime polish, and so were not\nthe major concern in the end.\n\nBott=\r\nom line, rust is either bad, or extremely bad, and it&#39;s tough to\ntell betwe=\r\nen the two before getting serious.  FWIW, JMO.\n\nNC  ;o)\n\n\n\n\n\n"
