It has =\r\na Shin gunto tsuka and a\n  &gt; older\n  &gt; &gt; appearing Kyo-sukashi tsuba. The b=\r\nlade is a bit &quot;rough&quot; but still\n  &gt; has\n  &gt; &gt; very visible hada. The hamon =\r\nappears to be Suguha for the most\n  &gt; part.\n  &gt; &gt; The hada is very prominan=\r\nt, it seems to be a Itame/Mokume mix with\n  &gt; &gt; Masame near the ha. The Mas=\r\name hada also can be clearly seen\n  &gt; through\n  &gt; &gt; the kissaki. The sword =\r\nis unsigned with a osujikai yasurime. The\n  &gt; &gt; nakago condition appears ( =\r\na guess ) approx. 1800-1860. I&#39;m\n  &gt; thinking\n  &gt; &gt; a late Edo copy of an K=\r\noto Yamato. Nagasa 65cm, machi width 3.1\n  &gt; cm,\n  &gt; &gt; yokote 2.1 cm, sori =\r\n1.5 cm. Do these characteristics suggest to\n  &gt; &gt; anyone a particular Shins=\r\nhinto School, Smith or Province. I know\n  &gt; it\n  &gt; &gt; would be difficult wit=\r\nh or without blade in hand, but any advice\n  &gt; or\n  &gt; &gt; information would b=\r\ne appreciated. Thanks.....\n  &gt; &gt;\n  &gt;\n\n\n\n   \n\n[Non-text portions of this mes=\r\nsage have been removed]\n\n\n"
