The comment about it being the 2nd outside of\nJapan is a reference to the October issue where there was another example\npublished with the claim of it being believed to be the only signed example\noutside of Japan.  How one would verify such a claim I don&#39;t know, but it&#39;s\na bit hard to believe.  Certainly attributed work is more common than\nsigned.\n:\n: Shigemitsu is the second generation of the Hayashi line after Matashichi,\nthe founder.  His work is well thought of, but is overshadowed by\nMatashichi, I think.  You&#39;ll find examples in the Higo sections of Sasano&#39;s\nsukashi tsuba books, in general tsuba books or of course in ones focusing on\nHigo.  Understanding the ins and outs of the Higo sukashi groups is\nchallenging.\n:\n: Jim\n:\n:\n:\n:   All, just received my december issue of To-Ron and there is an\nabsolutely gorgeous sukashi guard by Hayashi Shigemitsu. I see noted it is\nonly the 2nd knw guard outside of Japan by this artist. How rare is his\nwork, how highly is he rated ??.\n:\n:   Cheers\n:\n:   Rich\n:\n: [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n:\n:\n: To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n: nihontostudy-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n:\n:\n:\n: Yahoo!
