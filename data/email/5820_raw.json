You might want to consider whether a London based collector could do you a favor, pick up and ship the tsuba to you.  I would suggest finding out from Bonhams how someone could be authorized to get the tsuba and then inquiring on the Nihonto message board if someone would  be willing,\n\nDale Garbutt\n\n\n________________________________\nFrom: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com [mailto:nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com] On Behalf Of Kenneth Wilson\nSent: Wednesday, May 18, 2011 3:28 AM\nTo: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com; nihonto@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: [nihontostudy] auction ripoff\n\n\n\nHi all,\n\nI just wanted to warn anyone bidding on auctions to be careful of total ripoff\nshipping policies. Bonhams in England quoted me a price of 141 english pounds\nto ship 1 regular tsuba. I got a quote from mailbox etc which is around 100 and\nthat is still disgusting. I know it costs about $20 usd say around 15 pounds\nto ship. I emailed when I got the original quote and said you must be\nmistaken. They said that quote is correct, they use an outside vendor but the\nitem will be delivered to my doorstop. where else would it be delivered to? I\nfigured at those prices if they have 5-6 customers in NY they could actually\nsend a person by plane to hand deliver. I am debating what to do, but since I\nhaven&#39;t gotten a response back asking to speak to a person in charge, it looks\nlike I won&#39;t be a customer of theirs ever again. I am a strong believer in\nproviding customer service but when an action like this occurs, it just shows me\nthey don&#39;t really care. 3rd party or not you as a company are responsible for\nthe entire experience. If they chose the vendor, it is still part of their\nservice. I am just amazed at how much of a ripoff is being allowed to go on.\nSo be warned and be careful, a company I thought was reputable is a place I\ndon&#39;t think is acting in a reputable manner.\n\nHope all of you have better experiences.\nKen\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n________________________________\nThis transmission contains information from the law firm of Whiteford, Taylor & Preston LLP which may be confidential and/or privileged.
