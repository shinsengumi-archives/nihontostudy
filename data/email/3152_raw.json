I laugh at it now but it didn&#39;t sit well...\n\nHad to laugh at this comment because we have all experienced this thinking somewhere along the way. Actually, I doubt that many of us &quot;picked&quot; this hobby; rather, I think the hobby picked those of us having that &quot;spark,&quot; that fascination (obsession?) with ancient things needing preserving.  \n\n&gt;not having a &quot;ton of money&quot;...\n\nToday, I sometimes wonder how the newer collectors bitten by this interest survive, seeing the cost of things today. Then I realize that 35 years ago when swords could be bought for $25, many of us struggled to purchase those &quot;cheapies.&quot; Fresh out of the navy and with a new wife and baby, and making squat in salary, I had to peddle whatever could be found and then hoard those dollars for when a sword of interest was found. Fun times, indeed! So I suppose things never change.\n\n&gt;Whatever you spend on books, you will save when you come to buy your pieces.\n\nTruer words where never written! My only regrets regarding books are the books I sold off, thinking I&#39;d never really use them. Buy they better books as they come out because once they are out-of-print, the price exculates. Yes, the internet has a wealth of information on it but there is nothing like researching a sword of kodogu with a good library at your fingertips. You recommended &quot;educate yourself&quot; and that is the key to advancing in our area of study. I too was told to &quot;study, study, study&quot; when I met my first knowledgeable person familiar with Japanese swords (Dr. Thomas Hoopes) back around 1968. \n\nSorry...feeling &quot;grandfatherly&quot; today...just had to add my few cents worth to this discussion.\n\nRon\nSTL\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: Mark Jaillet \n  To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Tuesday, July 12, 2005 9:55 AM\n  Subject: RE: [nihontostudy] RE: Question....\n\n\n  Hi Kim,\n                      As a complete beginner myself, rest assured, there is\n  information out there. It will not however fall into your lap. There is a\n  ton of information on the web. I do not live in a &quot;Nihonto Knowledge Rich\n  Enviroment&quot;!  My only contact for information is the web.  As far as not\n  having a &quot;ton of money&quot;,  I once mentioned the same statement to my very\n  first contact in the Nihonto world. His reply to me was that maybe I should\n  pick another hobbie!  I laugh at it now but it didn&#39;t sit well with me when\n  he first told me. It forced me to re-focus my train of thought. EDUCATE\n  yourself Kim. Whatever you spend on books, you will save when you come to\n  buy your pieces.\n\n  Your frustration came across load and clear! As a beginner, I could relate.\n  I agree with Barry, we are all busy. Do not think that you are being\n  intensionally ignored.\n\n  Good luck in your quest.

I kind of feel like I\n    and my posts are invisible to everyone.  The other lists that I&#39;m on, I\n    get some type of response from someone, and I don&#39;t feel like I&#39;m\n    ignored.  If someone doesn&#39;t know, I would like to know this, if I need\n    to get Photos let me know, but don&#39;t ignore the questions.  There are a\n    lot of folks on this list which has expertise in parts of swords or full\n    swords and then there are folks, like myself which are learning from\n    asking questions and listening to the answers.  I don&#39;t have tons of\n    money for expensive books, what books I do have, do not cover areas\n    which I&#39;m asking questions about.  So, please, if someone asks a\n    question, please acknowledge it, even if it is an answer like, &quot;I don&#39;t\n    know the answer.&quot;\n\n    In the case of the question below, would it help in getting a photo of\n    the pieces and putting it up on this list for all of you to see?\n\n    Sincerely,\n    Kim\n\n    Kim Ghobrial wrote:\n\n    &gt;Hi Everyone,\n    &gt;Sorry to ask this, but I was looking at an Auction, which I&#39;m going to\n    &gt;see tomorrow and wanted to know if this is something for me to look at\n    &gt;or not.
