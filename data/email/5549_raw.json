It need a polish done by \nsomeone properly trained in that art, and with the proper supplies. \nAttempting to do it yourself will ruin the sword and any value it may \nhave. Without looking at the sword, or at least a few good pictures \nof it, no one can tell you what it is (Japanese or otherwise), nor \nhow old. With pictures some might venture a guess, but for a real \nopinion you&#39;ll need to take it to someone who knows nihonto so they \ncan examine it.\n\nBest,\n\nAndres\n\nAt 03:33 PM 2/22/2009, you wrote:\n\n&gt;I just got a japanese sword... me friend bought a old house & found it\n&gt;in the basement with some other old japanese things... i took the\n&gt;bamboo pins our & removed the handle & there is a line of japanese\n&gt;wrighting on both sides of the tang... the hand guard is iron shaped\n&gt;like a 4 petaled flower sort of... no other metal on the scabbard or\n&gt;handle other than the guard & a peice what looks like gold that goes\n&gt;over the blade just in front of the guard... the blade has some rust on\n&gt;it but not pitted anywhere... how do i clean off the rust and what\n&gt;parts of the sword can i clean without ruining its value if it has\n&gt;any ? havent done anything to it as far as trying to clean anything...\n&gt;only took off the handle to look...\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
