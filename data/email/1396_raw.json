Don&#39;t know \nhis last name it is lost to time. He was such a screw up everything he \ntouched went to Shizuoka if you get my drift. His name became \nsynonymous with F-ups. When I worked at Hunters Point Naval Shipyard, \n&quot;He pulled a Larry&quot; or &quot;Watch out you don&#39;t Larry that up&quot; were common \nexpressions. You may be THE Gorby, but it doesn&#39;t mean that every now \nand again Milt or anyone one of us might be a Gorby, Gorby!\n\n\n"
