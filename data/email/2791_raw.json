The seppa dai area does have those big\npock marks I see on Hirata tsuba.\n\nI am wondering if this is just a very late Hirata, a\nMeiji era export, or an attempt to imply Hirata &lt;I had\nrecently discussed a gi-taganamei Higo Kamiyoshi tsuba\nwith Jim G., in that the unsigned tsuba had\nhammermarks to imply it was the work of second\ngeneration Kamiyoshi &quot;Fukanobu&quot;&gt;.\n   On what little I have seen and very little I know\nof such Hirata tsuba, they always have radial marks on\nthe plate to add to the design impression of a shell.\nThis one been flat and black lacquered, seems very\nodd.\n\nThank you in advance to any replies,\n\nCurran \n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________ \nDo you Yahoo!? \nYahoo!
