I&#39;m sure that there=\r\n is further commentary in Joly&#39;s translations of Akiyama republished in the=\r\n NCJSC newsletters some years ago, but I don&#39;t have them organized or index=\r\ned.\n&gt;\n&gt;Nobuie Tsuba by Nakamura is as good a picture sources as any, at lea=\r\nst for having large numbers of examples to compare.  Each mei is attributed=\r\n to a type in the text of the oshigata section.  The attribution is usually=\r\n at or near the end of the text (lower left portion).  \n&gt;=E6=94=BE=E3=82=8C=\r\n=E9=8A=98 hanare-mei, =E5=A4=AA=E5=AD=97=E9=8A=98 futoji- mei, =E8=A9=B0=E3=\r\n=82=8A=E9=8A=98 sumari-mei, =E5=B7=A6=E5=82=BE=E9=8A=98 sakei-mei and =E7=\r\n=94=B2=E8=83=83=E9=8A=98 katchu-mei are ones I saw frequently when I flippe=\r\nd through the book.  \n&gt;\n&gt;In the past there were something like 8 or more ca=\r\ntegories of mei in use.  Most signatures these days are lumped into futoji-=\r\nmei and hanare-mei.  There&#39;s quite a bit of variability among accepted exam=\r\nples in each category though, so things are still not simple.  Wakayama sho=\r\nws some details about the different signatures in the first volume of his T=\r\noso Kodogu Koza.  No doubt there are other comparisons in the various surve=\r\ny books.\n&gt;\n&gt;It&#39;s a difficult area.\n&gt;\n&gt;Jim\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of =\r\nthis message have been removed]\n\n\n"
