Fairly classic design and at 81mm x 80mm x 5.5mm it\n&gt; &gt; &gt; is a =\r\nnice size. One of the traits here that I find most interesting is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the=\r\n mimi, and the obvious fold line that appears in it (it covers about\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n30% of the mimi). it is almost like the tsuba was made from a two plate\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; construction, though I am not suggesting that at all. I assume the\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n original plate was forged, then folded and forged again before shaping.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I cannot nay that I have seen this so clearly before in an Owari =\r\nguard\n&gt; &gt; &gt; before ( I will also note that I got it to jump out a bit with =\r\nsome\n&gt; &gt; &gt; clever lighting etc) and wondered if it was a normal trait in Ow=\r\nari \n&gt; &gt; works.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I really love the iron on this guard, its been =\r\nwell forged and is in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; really good condition.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; http://farm7=\r\n.static.flickr.com/6144/5934784209_807a0a2719_b.jpg\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; http://farm=\r\n7.static.flickr.com/6132/5934784543_7aa87f9b4a_b.jpg\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; http://far=\r\nm7.static.flickr.com/6144/5935345246_1aa21c6a64_b.jpg\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Cheers\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Rich\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been rem=\r\noved]\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been remo=\r\nved]\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; \n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
