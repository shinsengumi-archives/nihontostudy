I&#39;ve long been a fan of &quot;ishime&quot; ground and also the &quot;leather&quot; texture (name escapes me). When you think of it, if an artist is so talented and has such control to create every other aspect of a tsuba, why would he not have that ability when applying a finish like you speak of? Just a marvel, to somebody who has trouble trimming toenails evenly!\n\nPete...you still have &quot;those&quot; menuki???\n\nRon\nSTL\n\n\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: Peter A Bleed \n  To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Monday, January 12, 2004 8:56 AM\n  Subject: RE: [nihontostudy] Ko-Katchushi tsuba.....\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Matt,\n  You have engendered an interesting discussion and elicited Jim&#39;s usually\n  worthwhile insights. Thanks\n  In response to your comments, I took a look again and some of my katchushi\n  guards last night (they used to be so common and cheap that I couldn&#39;t\n  avoid becoming a &#39;collector&#39;). I have always loved the finish of these\n  tsuba which looks old and natural but which is also obviously the creation\n  of human intention. I am not familiar with Gemmell&#39;s book, but - like Jim -\n  I am sceptical about the use of a pointed hammer to created tsuba surfaces.\n  I can believe that a kinko might make and use a hammer with a network of\n  very fine points. As I think about it, use of irregular hammer and anvil\n  surfaces during the forging of the initial plate might be a means of\n  setting up the internal irregularities we call bones etc.\n  I agree with Jim, too, that whatever means was used to created a surface\n  finish, it probably involved a chisel or punch rather than direct pounding\n  with a hammer.\n  In that regard, let me recall a conversation with Hagawa-san, the Sendai\n  kinko I have mentioned to the list before. He makes frequent use of\n  &quot;ishime&quot; which is a smooth but &#39;irregular&#39; surface of small dots that looks\n  like a stone (ishi means stone). He told me that ishime is as hard to do as\n  nanako. It is done with specially crested punches (&#39;tagane&#39;) that are\n  struck with a hammer - one dot at a time. Hagawa-san said that once\n  started, an entire surface had to be done in one setting to assure a\n  uniform texture. If the work was interrupted, the piece will be ruined.\n  Thus, before he starts an ishime surface, he tells his wife and family that\n  they should not interrupt him til the tapping stopped. Maybe the point here\n  is that even if special tools are used, it is still the craftsman&#39;s skill\n  and intensity that matters.\n\n  Peter Bleed\n\n\n        Yahoo!
