We felt that going to press early in the second quarter was crucial given the nature of the findings.\n\nJim\n\n\n\n  Thanks to the research by Jim and others, we have made\n  a major discovery in relation to the origins and makers of\n  Saotome tsuba, contrary to the standard lineage given in\n  Japanese sources.\n\n  Saotome tsuba are now known to have been made by\n  a group of women tsuba makers; the so-called &quot;Rice\n  Planting Women&quot;. These were a group of women who\n  during the season were engaged in the planting of rice,\n  but who during the off season made tsuba as a means\n  of enhancing their incomes. These women tsuba makers\n  were excellent metal workers making well wrought tsuba\n  plates that they sold either as finished products or to\n  other schools of tsuba makers to embellish in that\n  schools particular style. This is perhaps the only\n  known instance where women composed a major\n  school of tsuba makers.\n\n  Thanks to Jim and others for their research in\n  bringing this important information to light.\n\n  Rich S\n  April 1, 2004 :-)\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
