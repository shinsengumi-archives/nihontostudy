He \nsays it is 130 to 140 yeears old.  I&#39;ve never seen one like it \nbefore. It&#39;s saya is made of bamboo.  The tsuba is gold or brass with \nwhat look like narcissus flowers and pods.  The blade is forged but \ndoesn&#39;t appear to be high-quality steel (hamon is midare).  The \nkojiri of the saya is flared.  The kissaki is O and the mune is \nihori. The boshi is midare-komi on one side and almost Jizo on the \nother.  Nakago appears to be tanago. The ji has what looks like long \nfaint lotus flowers decorating it.\n\nMore strangely, there is no kashira, same, ito, menuki, on the tsuka, \nwhich I believe is made of wood, rather than bamboo.\n\nI ran the characters past a Korean and a Chinese woman and neither \ncould tell me anything. No surprise there, however I couldn&#39;t \nidentify the characters in either the Japanese or Chinese character \nreferences on the Web.\n\nIf any of you fine scholars can tell me what Ive gotten myself into, \nor where it might actually be from and when, I would appreciate it.\nPlease respond to the group and to my email address: \ngrandone@... I&#39;m located in the USA.\n\nThanks so much for reading all this.\n \nRegards,\n\nJim\n\n\n\n\n"
