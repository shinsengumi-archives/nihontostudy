I have read the various prescriptions for cleaning, \nwaxing, etc... and, as I&#39;ve mentioned, I am quite the novice and so \nam in the dark as to what the current thinking on this is.  The \ntsuba I have are all in excellent condition, with only minimal spots \nof light surface rust in some of the sukashi openings, and none on \nthe plate or rim.  Again, I appreciate your thoughts on this, and am \ngradually coming to a view that if I&#39;m in doubt, do nothing!  \n\nThanks again,\n\nSteve\n\n\n"
