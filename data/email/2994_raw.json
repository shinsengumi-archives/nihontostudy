Or was it commonly an original feature?\n\nhttp://zincavage.org/LightningTsuba.html\n\nDavid\n\n\n\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: Jim Gilbert \n  To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Tuesday, May 17, 2005 10:46 PM\n  Subject: Re: [nihontostudy] tsuba box kanji\n\n\n  David,\n  The kanji say Akasaka, written right to left.  Usually things written on the side of boxes are group or motif names that make it easy for the owner to pull a given piece out of a stack.  What does the tsuba in the box look like?\n\n  Jim\n\n\n    A new tsuba came in today, in an interesting box of a form I have not seen.  The inside cloth portion was recessed to fit the tsuba.  No centerpiece to come off and expose the nails.  \n\n    The box&#39;s side had some kanji.  Could this be a reference to the particular tsuba, which has lightning inlaid in zogan.\n\n    http://zincavage.org/TsubaBox.html\n\n\n\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  Yahoo!
