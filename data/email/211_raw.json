In Fujishiro&#39;s, they place the Shodai in Genna ( 161=\r\n5 ) and the Nidai in Kanban ( 1661 ) They also have a yamato no daijo masan=\r\nori listed in Kan&#39;ei ( 1624 ) who may or may not be the Nidia. There would =\r\nseem to be quite a bit of difference in time between 1624 and 1661, I mean =\r\nbuy that, he would have either been pretty young if he was in fact the smit=\r\nh working in 1623 or pretty old when listed as the Nidai. \n\nI then also hav=\r\ne volume 47 of Token Shibata which has an excellent example of the Shodai&#39;s=\r\n work in it and it places it at Keich=F4 ( 1596 )\n\nDoes anyone have any cla=\r\nrification on when the Shodai and Nidai worked ?, and does Fujishiro&#39;s date=\r\n them according to title. i.e. the Nidai received the Daijo title in 1661 s=\r\no that is the date Fujishiro listed him from.\n\ncheers all\n\nRich T\n\n\n\n\n[Non-=\r\ntext portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
