They wer=\r\ne clearly not intended for mounting on a Japanese \nsword and, for this reas=\r\non cannot be considered to be &#39;tsuba&#39;.  \nNeither is this aperture compatibl=\r\ne with the tang of a Chinese \nsword, and my own belief is that such artefac=\r\nts were intended for \nmounting on a tie-jian, or Chinese &#39;fighting stick&#39;.\n=\r\n\nThe question of their nickel content can surely be resolved, either \nby mo=\r\ndern physical tecniques such as laser micro-spectral or atomic \nabsorption =\r\nspectral analysis.  Surely the effect of the forging \nprocess would be to m=\r\nore evenly distribute the nickel thoughout the \nbase metal?  Much more simp=\r\nly, the simple measurement of their \ndensity might be a guide.\n\nAs for the =\r\nuse of mercuric gilding, this is clealy only practicable \non copper artefac=\r\nts or on those of the soft-metal alloys containing \nthis element.  Before t=\r\nhe use of this gilding tecnique on iron, the \nartefact needs to be coated w=\r\nith a copper film, and this can \nnormally be seen where the gold has subseq=\r\nuently separated.\n\nRegards, John L.\n\n--- In nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com, &quot;=\r\nsosidore&quot; &lt;sosidore@y...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Dear all,\n&gt; \n&gt; In Chinese documented =\r\n4000 years of history meteorite have long \nbeen \n&gt; regarded as precious mat=\r\nerials. Ancient Chinese craftsmen \nprocessed \n&gt; stone meteorites into varie=\r\nties of item for religious worshipping \n&gt; purposes. I guess iron meteorites=\r\n were also used for same \npurposes. \n&gt; Only they weathered away in time soo=\r\nner than their stonny counter \npart. \n&gt; I posted once again 2 iron tsubas o=\r\nnto my folder entitled \nSOSIDORE. \n&gt; This time they revealed cleared gilded=\r\n finish. \n&gt; I suspeceted they were made of iron meteorite based on followin=\r\ng \n&gt; reasons.\n&gt; \n&gt; 1. They are lighter than iron.\n&gt; Iron meteorites are rar=\r\nely pure iron. They usually contain nickel. \nSome \n&gt; meteorites contain ple=\r\nnty of iron. They are heavy in weight and \n&gt; weathered away much sooner. So=\r\nme iron meteorites contain plenty of \n&gt; nickel. They are apparently lighter=\r\n and can better resist weather. \nThe \n&gt; two iron tsubas showed here are rel=\r\natively light. They showed \n&gt; superficial rusting only, evidencing higher c=\r\nontent of nickel. \nInitial \n&gt; observations support the idea that they might=\r\n be once a part of an \niron \n&gt; meteorite with considerable content of nicke=\r\nl.\n&gt; The chiseled holes revealed a secret about the distribution of \n&gt; mate=\r\nrials within tsubas are not even. Again it points to a \npossibility \n&gt; that=\r\n the tsuba materials could have been iron-nickel alloy with \ncontent \n&gt; of =\r\nwhich not evenly distributed. And this is characteristics quite \n&gt; common i=\r\nn case of meteorite.\n&gt; \n&gt; I purchased these two iron tsubas from a Chinese =\r\nvendor who used \nto \n&gt; sell antiques. There is strong possibility these twp=\r\n artifacts \nwere \n&gt; unearthed in China.\n&gt; \n&gt; They way these 2 iron tsubas g=\r\nilded was typical Chinese. However, \nI am \n&gt; pretty sure that in Japan mirr=\r\nor craftsman followed exactly same \nmethod \n&gt; in treating mirror surface wi=\r\nth mercury. The same technique can \ncome \n&gt; out with gilded finish when add=\r\ning gold-grains into the mixture of \n&gt; rubbed-on materials. \n&gt; \n&gt; Now, I am=\r\n wondering if these two iron tsubas were of Japanese \norigin.\n&gt; \n&gt; The most=\r\n convincing clues of all are the inscriptions. \n&gt; 1. Chinese way of arrangi=\r\nng characters always comes from top down \nand \n&gt; from left to right. In thi=\r\ns case. They are to be read from top \ndown \n&gt; then left to right.\n&gt; 2. The =\r\ncontent of inscriptions are typical Japanese.\n&gt; 3. The style of fonts are t=\r\nypically Japanese.\n&gt; \n&gt; The three points mentioned excluded the possibility=\r\n that they were \n&gt; originally made in China. Even if they were once contrac=\r\nted with \n&gt; Chinese craftsmen made to Japanese order the font of characters=\r\n \n&gt; concerned betrayed the fact that Chinese people never trained to \nwrite=\r\n \n&gt; nor processed kanji onto surface of any materials in Japanese \nstyle. \n=\r\n&gt; Only Japanese can..  \n&gt; \n&gt; For sure these two iron trubas are not isolate=\r\nd case. I wonder \nwhere \n&gt; are the rest of them and in what form? Anyone kn=\r\nows any record \nabout \n&gt; iron meteorite processed into any other type of it=\r\nems that became \npart \n&gt; of Nihonto?\n&gt; \n&gt; SOSIDORE\n&gt; Chen, Ying-chaw\n&gt; Taip=\r\nei\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n"
