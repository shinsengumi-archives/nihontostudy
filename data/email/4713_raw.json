Looks like a Namban tsuba, made of brass and possibly and \nfini=\r\nshed in Shakudo, though I am not completely sure on the finish. It \nwould p=\r\nrobably date to sometime in the Edo period. So what does all that \nmean ?\n\n=\r\nNamban refers to a tsuba school that specialised in Chinese styles or forms=\r\n.\nShakudo is a mix of alloys (95% brass and 5 gold) that makes a very \nblac=\r\nk finish.\nThe Edo period ran from 1615 to 1868 app.\n\nThe theme is two drago=\r\nns, intertwined in arabesques, and at the top \nlooks t0o be the sacred jewe=\r\nl of Shinto and bottom, some form of mon ( \nfamily crest )\n\nI could be way =\r\noff on all of that of course.\n\nhope that helps a bit.\n\nCheers\n\nRichard Turn=\r\ner\n\n\nPatrick wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hello,\n&gt;\n&gt; I was hoping to get some help regarding =\r\na &#39;Tsuba&#39; I have. I know\n&gt; nothing of them, in fact the only reason I know =\r\nthey are called\n&gt; &#39;Tsubas&#39; is because I saw one on television this morning.=\r\n..\n&gt;\n&gt; I Googled &#39;Tsuba&#39; and this group was one of the first links I found.=\r\n I\n&gt; have tried - with difficulty - to identify and date my tsuba.\n&gt;\n&gt; So I=\r\n thought I would seek help from people who know about tsubas and\n&gt; Japanese=\r\n swords.\n&gt; Here is a link to a photograph of it:\n&gt; http://img.photobuc ket.=\r\ncom/albums/ v340/donuil_ dhu/_DSC0031. jpg \n&gt; &lt;http://img.photobucket.com/a=\r\nlbums/v340/donuil_dhu/_DSC0031.jpg&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; I think it may be bronze. And help =\r\nI could get with identifying and\n&gt; dating it would be briliant!
