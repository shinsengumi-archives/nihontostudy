I have definitely seen other examples of the motif, but with a rim.  Hard to come up with an attribution based on the photo.  It might not be a professionally made guard.  The square cutout in the nakago ana is interesting.  You see that on some Nanban guards (not that I think this one has anything to do with Nanban style).\n\nThe plate of the chidori guard looks like typical Tadatsugu work, but those are not typically decorated beyond the simple sukashi patterns.  Tadatsugu was associated with the Umetada group, who of course did nunome zogan.  The nunome here doesn&#39;t look to be very high quality, though.  Maybe it&#39;s a later addition to jazz up the guard.  I can&#39;t make out the surface carving very well in the photo, but I can see that it&#39;s there.  I can&#39;t say that I&#39;ve seen a combination exactly like that before.  It&#39;s not typical of Tadatsugu work.  I suppose it was done to give the surface some visual activity.  It doesn&#39;t look deep enough to have been for inlay that is now missing.  The boat in the reeds w/birds motif is quite common, but I haven&#39;t seen it combined with a plum blossom before.  These may be successive layers of decoration that don&#39;t relate to one another beyond being present on the same tsuba.\nJim\nP.S. I think that your Higo guards are Heianjo zogan.\n\n-----\nJim,\nI can&#39;t find similar example in books on the rat.( may be there&#39;s a reason \nwhy ....... =)  )\n\nAlso I have not seen the way they punched/incised pattern on the iron plate ( \nthe chidori tsuba ), then did the flat inlays with subject matters ( chidori, \nboat/reeds )totally unrelated to the pattern ( circle/curve lies ).\nThat basically is why I want to find out further...............\n\nMilt\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
