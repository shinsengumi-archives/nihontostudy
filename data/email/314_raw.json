The ir=\r\non parrying bars would have taken care of other blades.  I don&#39;t recall any=\r\nthing about the leather plate that would suggest that it wasn&#39;t contemporar=\r\ny with the rest of the mounting, but my memory of it isn&#39;t good enough to b=\r\nase an argument on.  There is a somewhat similar koshirae at the bottom of =\r\npage 82 of Bottomley and Hopson&#39;s &quot;Arms and Armor of the Samurai.&quot;  Scanned=\r\n here for your convenience:\nhttp://tinyurl.com/dd82\n\nI suppose it&#39;s possibl=\r\ne that someone transplanted a shinai tsuba onto the nagamaki koshirae.  But=\r\n on the other hand if you set out to make a round leather guard to go on a =\r\nround wooden stick, I&#39;m not sure how one for a nagamaki pole would or shoul=\r\nd look different from one for a shinai.  Any ideas?\n\nIf we were talking abo=\r\nut a loose guard not associated with a koshirae, I&#39;d agree with Mo that it&#39;=\r\ns much more likely to have been from a shinai or bokken than a nagamaki.  B=\r\nut this one did come on a nagamaki and we have other examples of pole arms =\r\nmounted like this with a hand guard on the pole and parrying bars either mo=\r\nunted on the nakago or on the pole.  Am I missing something?\nJim \n\n--\n\n\n  &lt;=\r\nhttp://tinyurl.com/d2ee&gt;http://tinyurl.com/d2ee\n\n  Jim-\n        I just got =\r\naround to looking at this. Check the size of that \n  hole dude!=DD Are you =\r\nsure this is original to the pole? This looks \n  like a kendo shinai tsuba,=\r\n a very old one but I would bet it is for a \n  shinai none the less.\n  Tom\n=\r\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
