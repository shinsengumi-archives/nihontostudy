The seller was a gentleman about it and settled up with me, as expected. There were multiple photos. Soon after I made this purchase another alike tsuba was offered out of Japan (350076519430) which looked very nice, but one that I thought looks newer (to my surprise, of course). I was not trying to get a bargain, but hoped to discover a Yoshiro work in a different (than mon-sukashi) for my study. Oh well, maybe next time. Making SF show???\n\nRon\n\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: Peter A Bleed \n  To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Monday, July 21, 2008 1:20 PM\n  Subject: Re: [nihontostudy] clear lacquer\n\n\n\n  Ron,\n  Fakes coming out of Japan have emerged as a interesting problem for\n  collectors. I- for one - would like to see the eBay image of your recent\n  acquisition. Would you care to post it?\n  Peter\n\n  I&#39;ve always enjoyed Heianjo (never owning an Onin work that I know of) and Yoshiro \n  mon-sukashi works. Always like brass inlay on good iron! \n\n  To my surprise, I just received what I thought looked like a nice early iron with \n  brass inlay tsuba, recently purchased of Ebay, my first Ebay purchase in ages. \n  After 40-odd years I thought I had a good &quot;eye&quot; for such things; just bought a \n  repro! Yikes! Hope to reverse the deal but must admit that &quot;pictures are \n  deceiving&quot; at times. Looks like an honest mistake on the seller&#39;s part, but it \n  points up the importance of in-hand study. (I think others spotted this since my \n  bid was much too low if authentic. Just mentioning this to point out how good (in \n  pictures only) these repros are today. \n\n  Enjoyed this topic of lacquer on Heianjo works. I once owned a very similar (or \n  same one?) tsuba that was pointed out here. I need to sit down and check some of \n  my other early tsuba for lacquer. \n\n  Ron \n  STL \n\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: Dr. Philip Vos Fellman \n  To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Monday, July 21, 2008 8:42 AM \n  Subject: Re: [nihontostudy] clear lacquer \n\n  Hi All: \n\n  Heianjo are complex. For a start, most Heianjo (real Heianjo and not Edo period \n  copies) are Momoyama period or earlier. They were mainly made just for a hundred \n  years or so, basically the 16th century. The earlier pieces are sometimes called \n  Onin, but even if you include this group, you still only get the period around \n  1450-1600. That means that they are old. Many were lacquered. Some were well \n  preserved some were not. The lacquer is part of the overall gestalt. If you see a \n  hundred Heianjo tsuba, 25 or so will be lacquered, of which 5 will be in excellent \n  condition, 10 will be decently preserved, 5 will be in need of varying degrees of \n  restoration and 5 will be dead. \n\n  Cheers, \n\n  Shirogitsune \n\n  --- On Sun, 7/20/08, bungotakadasword &lt;MuramasaIII@...&gt; wrote: \n\n  From: bungotakadasword &lt;MuramasaIII@...&gt; \n  Subject: [nihontostudy] clear lacquer \n  To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n  Date: Sunday, July 20, 2008, 1:58 PM \n\n  gang, \n  last time i mentioned noticing &#39; clear lacquer &quot; on most Heianjo tsuba, \n  people thought i was smoking some good weeds....... .... \n\n  Typical response was ........... fire scales \n\n  http://www.nihontok anjipages. com/tosogu. com/ \n\n  how about that ? \n\n  milt \n\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed] \n\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed] \n\n\n\n\n\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n   \n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
