ISB=\r\nN 90\n400 9279 6.\n\nI have seen some of these pieces in person and the work i=\r\ns quite\ndifferent from Mino, although I see what you&#39;re thinking.  I&#39;m not =\r\naware\nof anything documenting who the specific makers were.  They weren&#39;t\nn=\r\necessarily nihonto fittings makers.  All sorts of decorative items were\nmad=\r\ne in this style, boxes, bowls, buttons, buckles, tea services, pipes,\netc. =\r\n You should be able to see some examples at the Rijksmuseum in\nAmsterdam.  =\r\nThe Metropolitan Museum here in NYC has a few examples on\ndisplay.\n\nJim\n\n\n\n=\r\n\nGang, although not entirely Japanese Sword Related, I still thought it\nmig=\r\nht be interesting to bring this up. It seems that tsuba makers also\nmade sh=\r\nakudo hilts for Rapiers and Short Swords for the Dutch in the\nearly 18th ce=\r\nnt. I have included an excerpt below from the book I am\nreading at the mome=\r\nnt:\n\n[On the topic of Short Swords]\n\n&#39;The Dutch also traded with Japan and =\r\nas a result a variety of wares\nmade by Japanese craftsmen were carried back=\r\n to the West. These included\nhilts makde of shakudo, a mixture of copper an=\r\nd gold, and patinated to a\nrich blue colour to contrast with the gilded pan=\r\nels of relief\ndecorations set at intervals on the guard, knucklebow and pom=\r\nmel. As\nwith the ivory hilts from Ceylon, contemporary Dutch hilts were the=\r\n\nprototypes for these exotic pieces. The craftsmen who made them were\nspeci=\r\nalists in tsuba, Japanese sword guards, and came from the area\naround Nagas=\r\naki. The majority of these exotic hilts echo standard\nsmallsword or hunting=\r\n sword hilts of the 1700&#39;s but hilt forms of the\n1750&#39;s were also copied.&#39;\n=\r\n\nThe author then goes on to illustrate such a Japanese shakudo hilt. It\nact=\r\nually kind of looks a tiny bit like Mino work. Very remarkable. Now\nhas any=\r\none ever seen any of these items first hand? Is this phenomenon\ndocumented?=\r\n Do we know which tsuba makers got involved in this new\nbusiness?\n\nAnd sinc=\r\ne the Dutch were ordering them back in the 18th cent, I might\nwant to keep =\r\nmy eyes peeled other here, to see if any turn up at auction\nor a local anti=\r\nquefair (I am in The Netherlands). I would be so lucky\nhahahahaha..\n\nRegard=\r\ns, Matthew\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nYahoo!
