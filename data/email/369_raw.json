I don&#39;t know what the difference in use was, but there probably was a practical reason.  I don&#39;t have a firm understanding of toppei koshirae, but at least some of these examples with the external spring clip were apparently made for wear with Western-style clothing.  Some toppei koshirae without a spring clip still have a ring-swivel fitting instead of a kurikata.  Others have a fixed or swivel ring mounted on the &quot;edge&quot; rather than the side of the saya.  I think that the sageo used was more like a string rather than a flat braid.  I suspect that they were worn at a different angle to the body and possibly there was a greater risk of the sword falling out of the saya, hence the clip.  I don&#39;t know much about them.  Tom, any ideas?\n\nEtched soft metal isn&#39;t a very common technique.  Good lacquer and an interesting wrap, too.  It would fit right in the Edo no Tanto Koshirae picture book.\nJim\n\n\n\n  Jim:\n\n  Thanks for the compliment!\n\n  Soft metal fittings that were etched.\n  It has a ring, not kurikata. (was this used for a different purpose?)\n\n  Thanks very much,\n  Ron P.\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
