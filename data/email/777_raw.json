I find it difficult to get my arms around the group because of the range of their output.  I have seen some menuki and fuchigashira signed by Nagatsune with animal motifs where the eyes were formed with that same raised ring and dot seen on the large buffalo.  Kind of wide awake and a little bugged out.  I&#39;m not sure if there were other groups that made eyes quite like that.  Not an area that I&#39;m strong in, but that&#39;s the only thing that stands out for me here.  Anyone else have a better grasp of Ichinomiya?\nJim\n\n\n\n  Hi all - \n\n  Benson has a really wonderful pair of menuki depicting &quot;water buffalo&quot; or as Bob has billed them, &quot;cows&quot;, on his web site. The gold on the small &quot;cow&quot; next tot he larger one looks to be utori. Pins are solid rounded pins with base feet. Looks like these Tokubetsu Hozon menuki are attributed to Ichinomiya School. My question, can anyone give some comments on connecting the workmanship of these menuki to the Ichinomiya school? Would be interesting!\n\n  Ron\n  STL\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
