Yes, he even slept with it! (Lord only knows...) Two of these tsuba took on a wonderful color within a month while another--it seems it was a later tsuba of a more dense/harder plate--did not color much. Like Cary&#39;s tsuba from years ago--tsuba in the pocket treatment--sometimes natural oils (juices) work, sometimes they don&#39;t. \n\nRon\nSTL\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: Richard Turner \n  To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Thursday, September 23, 2004 6:51 PM\n  Subject: Re: [nihontostudy] Re: Care of sukashi tsuba\n\n\n\n  &gt;  I discovered a better way now,\n  &gt; no, it&#39;s not wearing it in your rear pocket (  for the SF residents ).\n  &gt;\n  &gt; milt\n  &gt;\n  &gt;\n  I actually think that the fasion statement of having a tsuba in every \n  pocket, weighing down your trousers and making all your pockets bulge is \n  not a bad thing :-)\n\n  Rich Turner\n\n        Yahoo!
