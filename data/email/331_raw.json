I&#39;m not gloating or bragging - well I am, but collectors are allowed\nto do that. My real goal in this posting is to discuss what I think is a\nvery interesting sword fitting.\n      It is still to be seen as item 2176985428 on the world&#39;s marketplace.\nPlease take a look.\n      One of my research interests is the history of Japanese archeological\nresearch. Usually, archeology is presented as a subject that was introduced\nto Japan in the early Meiji period by Edward Morse. Japan is littered with\nold sites, tho, so there must have been an older interest in ancient stuff.\nOf course there was and I have found evidence of  a fair amount of Edo\nperiod interest in stuff we now see as prehistoric. There were collectors\nand collectors&#39; groups, and named types. I think there were as well some\npretty good understandings that objects like stone artifacts reflected old\nways of doing things. And in that light, I find this tsuka very\ninteresting.\n      The &quot;menuki&quot; on this tsuka are absolutely Jomon era arrow points. In\nfact, Jomon points are pretty uniform for thousands of years (unlike the\ncase in North America, for example) so it is hard to know the specific age\nof these two artifacts. But that is what they are. Finding them tied into\nEdo period fittings is proof that folks at that time were picking ancient\nobjects up, looking at them, and finding them interesting. I think it also\nsuggests that somebody must have figured out that these two things were\nsome manner of weapon or at least something that went with a sword.\n      Now I have not seen the tsuka - only the images - but based on them\nI see this as a pretty ordinary piece of koshirae - lacquered tsuka-ito,\nbut shark skin rather than same, and pretty rustic iron fuchi-kashira. It\nseems to be a katana size so it would be a real samurai&#39;s sword, but I see\nit as a &quot;country piece.&quot;  Archaeological sites are where you find them, but\nI could certainly believe that a rural samurai, like a country\nadministrator or a local land owner, could acquire stone points and find\nthem interesting enough to use in this way. Do you all agree?\n      Finally, let me ask the list if anyone out there has ever seen any\nother use of archeological objects on or with  swords or other Edo period\nstuff\n      Thanks for listening.\nPeter Bleed\n                                                                            \n                                                                            \n                                                                            \n                                                                            \n                                                                            \n                                                                            \n\n\n\n\nPeter Bleed\nAssociate Dean\nCollege of Arts and Sciences\n1223 Oldfather Hall\nUniversity of Nebraska\nLincoln, NE 68588-0312\n(402) 472-2891\n\n\n\n"
