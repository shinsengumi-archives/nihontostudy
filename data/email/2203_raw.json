I think the \nmessage I&#39;m getting is:  just leave well enough alone!  So I \nbelieve I will...  :o).  \nOne thing, though:  for rookies like me, how would you suggest \nbeing able to spot the oiled, waxed, or (gulp) painted tsuba that \nmay deceive me?  I certainly hear what you&#39;re saying, and want \nto heed your words.  But how, exactly, can I know it when I see it?  \nI don&#39;t believe any of the pieces I&#39;ve acquired thus far have been \ntampered with this way, but I guess I can&#39;t really be sure (I have \nnot attempted any soap and water cleaning of them.  They \nappear in great condition to my untrained eye, and so I haven&#39;t \nfelt any need to clean...).  Most of my pieces have Hozon papers: \nwould this be any indication at all that the tsuba in question are \nmore likely to be &quot;deception-free&quot;?  Or is that entirely irrelevant?  \nSorry for all the bothersome questions, but I really am eager to \nbecome informed!  Many thanks, Richard, for your time and \nattention...\n\nSteve\n\n\n--- In nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com, Richard George &lt;\nrkg@t...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; steven,\n&gt; \n&gt; first,\n&gt; \n&gt; DON&quot;T MESS WITH THE RUST INSIDE THE SUKASHI \nCUTOUTS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n&gt; \n&gt; Now that I&#39;ve said that...\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ve seen all sorts of tsuba abuse (&quot;brown&quot; wax, various \nattempts at \n&gt; repatination, people who have\n&gt; decided they can do a better job of patination than the original \nmaker \n&gt; and strip top quality\n&gt; pieces down and start over, people who just wax them with \nsome magic \n&gt; compound, oil them, etc.,.) - don&#39;t do it -\n&gt; basically, Jinsoo is absolutely correct - if the surface patina is \ngood, \n&gt; just store &#39;em somewhere where they\n&gt; won&#39;t get condensed on and rub them periodically with your \nhands/a soft \n&gt; cloth.  If its got problems, see below...\n&gt; \n&gt; the deadly enemy of iron tsuba is red rust - if your piece has \nthis on \n&gt; it, its a problem.  somehow you have to\n&gt; get this off - some people use horn, but I&#39;ve found that ivory \nseems to \n&gt; be really good for use to scrape this off\n&gt; while not harming the the brown rust (I think Jim Gilbert has an \n&gt; excellent article on this in a couple of\n&gt; places on line...).  - often you have to work at it quite a bit - I \n&gt; sometimes alternate scraping sessions with\n&gt; washing the piece in warm water with a mild soap and a soft \n&gt; toothbrush...  And again, you only want to\n&gt; do this ONLY on the outside surfaces of the tsuba, not down in \nthe sukashi.\n&gt; \n&gt; After you&#39;ve done that, the revealed old rust regions are often \npretty \n&gt; gnarly, or if the piece is just plain &quot;rough&quot;,\n&gt; you can &quot;pocket polish&quot; the piece - just carry it around\n&gt; in your pocket for a few weeks (NOT where you carry your keys/\nchange) - \n&gt; this gives the piece a nice rubbed look that\n&gt; is hard to get by just marathon rubbing sessions with a cloth...\n&gt; \n&gt; When you&#39;re buying tsuba, always be on the lookout for pieces \nthat have \n&gt; been &quot;primped&quot; like this - you&#39;ll see\n&gt; people that hide a multitude of sins with various waxes, oils, \nPAINT (I \n&gt; got a couple like this - the guy color\n&gt; matched the patina and jammed the tsuba (!!) - looked real \ndarned good, \n&gt; too - I was quite happy until I tried to clean\n&gt; up a rough spot I thought was oil, used some enamel thinner, \nand - \n&gt; surprise!...), etc.,.  I&#39;d like to think they\n&gt; just wanted the pieces to look better/didn&#39;t know any better and \nreally \n&gt; weren&#39;t thinking fraudulent thoughts, but....\n&gt; \n&gt; Good Luck,\n&gt; \n&gt; rkg\n&gt; (Richard George)\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;Milt,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Jinsoo Kim told me that the best way to care for the old iron \n&gt; &gt;sukashi pieces I have is to simply rub them now and then \nwith a soft \n&gt; &gt;silk cloth.  I have read the various prescriptions for cleaning, \n&gt; &gt;waxing, etc... and, as I&#39;ve mentioned, I am quite the novice \nand so \n&gt; &gt;am in the dark as to what the current thinking on this is.  The \n&gt; &gt;tsuba I have are all in excellent condition, with only minimal \nspots \n&gt; &gt;of light surface rust in some of the sukashi openings, and \nnone on \n&gt; &gt;the plate or rim.  Again, I appreciate your thoughts on this, \nand am \n&gt; &gt;gradually coming to a view that if I&#39;m in doubt, do nothing!  \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Thanks again,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Steve\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;Yahoo!
