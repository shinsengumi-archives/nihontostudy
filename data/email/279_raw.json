The tsuba on\nthe\n  &gt;Uesugi Kenshin pieces are yamagane and kiku shaped sukashi pieces. My\n  &gt;nagamaki has a rounded-square disk in yamagane -- absolutely plain.\n  &gt;\n  &gt;Gordon\n  &gt;  -----Original Message-----\n  &gt;  From: Richard George [mailto:rkg@...]\n  &gt;  Sent: Friday, May 23, 2003 1:21 PM\n  &gt;  To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com\n  &gt;  Subject: [nihontostudy] polearm tsuba question\n  &gt;\n  &gt;\n  &gt;  hey guys,\n  &gt;\n  &gt;  Are there any other polearm lovers out there - check out this tsuba -\nit\n  &gt;  supposedly came off a nagamaki:\n  &gt;\n  &gt;  http://home.teleport.com/~rkg/misc/front_small.JPG\n  &gt;  http://home.teleport.com/~rkg/misc/front_small.JPG\n  &gt;  http://home.teleport.com/~rkg/misc/edge_small.JPG\n  &gt;  (there are a few other closeups in the same directory, but I didn&#39;t\n  &gt;  quite get a couple of &#39;em in focus - sorry about\n  &gt;  presenting this upside down, but I really busy last night and didn&#39;t\nget\n  &gt;  a chance to rotate the photos...).\n  &gt;\n  &gt;  The piece is 2.885&quot; by 2.73&quot; by.21&quot; thick at the rim and ~.175 in the\n  &gt;  center.  The rim appears to be\n  &gt;  silver, and the sukashi pieces appear to be filled with lead.\n  &gt;\n  &gt;  The piece appears to be pretty old (Jim pointed out that it looked like\n  &gt;  there were a couple of layers of lacquer\n  &gt;  on it), and the lead makes it really heavy for a tsuba of this size.\n  &gt;\n  &gt;  So, has anybody seen something like this on a &quot;real&quot; naginata/nagamaki\n  &gt;  koshirae?  any attempts at kantei, observations,\n  &gt;  etc., would be greatly appreciated.\n  &gt;\n  &gt;  thanks,\n  &gt;\n  &gt;  rkg\n  &gt;  (Richard George)\n  &gt;\n  &gt;\n  &gt;\n  &gt;\n  &gt;\n  &gt;        Yahoo!
