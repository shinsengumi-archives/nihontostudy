That description says that they were \n&gt; first issued in the 1880&#39;s, so maybe it is just old enough that it had \n&gt; been &quot;handed down&quot; one generation or something (making it an \n&gt; &quot;heirloom&quot;). I didn&#39;t see anything that could be considered a hamon, \n&gt; but I also figured I didn&#39;t really know what I was looking for/at.\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n&gt; &lt;mailto:nihontostudy%40yahoogroups.com&gt;, &lt;nixe@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Sue\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; where are you located? if one of us are in your area we could \n&gt; arrange to see it. The tanto is a Navy officer&#39;s dirk, they were made \n&gt; from early 1900&#39;s through WWII. Some had hand made blades but most had \n&gt; machine made blades. If you google Japanese Navy Dirk you might see \n&gt; others like yours.
