Can  \nyou direct me to a book I am likely to have where it may be found?\n\tYou raised a question earlier, is the taste in schools like Jingo  \n&quot;learned&quot; because the books and teachers all say it is good? I think  \nthat quality has to be &quot;taught&quot;, you have to see and compare many  \nfine examples to discern it. The teachers taste though may not become  \nthe students. Alan makes a good point, in that we have to know the  \ntastes of the times to understand why certain themes and materials  \nwere used and what was seen as masterwork in one era may not compare  \nwell to those of another time. However we don&#39;t have to blindly  \nfollow the fashions of the past.\n\tIf you like it, you like it. Buy and collect what you like. What we  \nsee as clunky and rustic in a bad way, appealed to someone at some  \npoint or your tsuba would not exist. It seems you like it and it  \nfound you, thats a good thing.\n-t\n\n"
