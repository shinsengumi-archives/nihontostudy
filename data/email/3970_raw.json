I&#39;m looking forward to contributing here as well.\nI am also h=\r\nappy to hear that you are thinking of updating your site \nin the not-too-di=\r\nstant future.  Such a superb site, and I&#39;m sure the \nnew images of mimi/tek=\r\nkotsu will be invaluable for those of us who \nare big on Owari and Kanayama=\r\n...\n\nSteve\n\n\n--- In nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Jim Gilbert&quot; &lt;jggilbert@=\r\n...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Welcome, Steven.  Looking forward to hearing more from you=\r\n.\n&gt; \n&gt; Jim\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   Greetings everyone,\n&gt; \n&gt;   I am new to the forum he=\r\nre, at least as a contributor...  I \n&gt;   have &quot;lurked&quot; here for some time, =\r\nand finally decided it was \ntime I \n&gt;   joined you all in your excellent di=\r\nscussions.  As a &quot;tsuba man,&quot; \nI \n&gt;   have especially appreciated the recen=\r\nt activity on this site.  \nYou \n&gt;   are all so knowledgeable and generous w=\r\nith your thoughts and \n&gt;   comments---it certainly helps someone like me wh=\r\no is relatively \nnew \n&gt;   to tsuba.  \n&gt; \n&gt;   I have very much enjoyed the K=\r\nantei of recent days, and the \n&gt;   excellent photographs of tekkotsu that J=\r\nim has provided.  It \nreally \n&gt;   helps to have such images for reference. =\r\n \n&gt; \n&gt;   Fascinating thoughts, too, on the matter of aesthetic valuation \no=\r\nf \n&gt;   tsuba in pre-Edo times.  Jim&#39;s refereces to the tea ware of the \nday=\r\n \n&gt;   are intriguing as well.  \n&gt; \n&gt;   Anyway, I just wanted to introduce m=\r\nyself and express my \n&gt;   appreciation for the great activity on the board.=\r\n  I will look \n&gt;   forward to seeing more, and to contributing a few words =\r\nhere and \n&gt;   there.  Best to all...\n&gt; \n&gt;   Steven\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portio=\r\nns of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n"
