When I first glanced at the shumei I picked up on the second character=\r\n as the &quot;a&quot; =E9=98=BF in Shoami and then on the next character as the middl=\r\ne kanji =E4=B9=99 from Saotome.  Of course the rest does not fit either cas=\r\ne, although Saotome and Ko-Shoami would be somewhat defensible attributions=\r\n.  The first kanji looks like ichi/kazu =E4=B8=80 and the last ko =E5=B0=8F=\r\n.  I can&#39;t make sense of it, but feel like I must be missing something obvi=\r\nous.  The other character at the left appears to be a kao, although I do no=\r\nt know who it belongs to.\n\n I also spent time on your gold seal when you po=\r\nsted it, but struck out on that one too.  I don&#39;t have a tensho dictionary =\r\nso I asked my shodo teacher to look it up, but couldn&#39;t conclude on any kno=\r\nwn tsubako.\n\nThey&#39;re both bugging me, so if I turn anything up I will post =\r\nit.  Meanwhile, hopefully someone else will take a look and settle it.\n\nSor=\r\nry,\nJim\n\n\n\n\n  A colleage, and collector, has recently purchased the sukashi=\r\n tsuba \n  illustrated in my Photo Album JPL and has asked for my advice \n  =\r\nregarding its possible attribution and for a translation of the red \n  lacq=\r\nuer inscription  The figure on the bottom left appears to be a \n  kao, but =\r\nI am otherwise at a complete loss.  Any help/suggestions re \n  either of th=\r\nese requests would be much appreciated.\n\n  While you are in my Photo Album,=\r\n I am still seeking some information \n  on the gold, hira-zogan seal.  Ther=\r\ne has been a complete absence of \n  replies to my earlier request regarding=\r\n this.\n\n  Grateful thanks and regards, JPL.\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this m=\r\nessage have been removed]\n\n\n"
