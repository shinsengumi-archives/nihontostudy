There is a small section also on his kokuin \nand Kao ( do you have the book ? ) it is in Japanese but I can copy that \nsection for you if you like.\n\nJust for general interests sake, his Kao is made up up the disassembled \nkanji &#39;Hide&#39; which is re assembled in a different order, interesting.\n\ncheers\n\nRich\n\nRon Hartmann wrote:\n\n&gt; Hi all -\n&gt;\n&gt; Somebody asked me about how &quot;kokuin&quot; were put onto nakago. I&#39;ve always \n&gt; refered to these as &quot;hot stamped&quot; but really, I wonder how the smith \n&gt; applied these stamps. The nakago being soft (not hardened), were they \n&gt; punched in after the sword was finished? It would seem illogical to \n&gt; think the smith &quot;heated the nakago&quot; enough to &quot;hot stamp&quot; their seal. \n&gt; Can anyone explain how this was done?\n&gt;\n&gt; A related question is about Masahide who did apply a &quot;kokuin&quot; to his \n&gt; nakago. Does anyone know if Masahide ever signed his nakago with his \n&gt; &quot;kokuin&quot; only? (Not signing his full mei with it.)\n&gt;\n&gt; Ron\n&gt; STL\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; To manage your options for this group:\n&gt;\n&gt; Post message: nihonto@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subscribe:  nihonto-subscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Unsubscribe:  nihonto-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Nihonto group website: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/nihonto\n&gt;\n&gt; Remember: Honor is your most important attribute!\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
