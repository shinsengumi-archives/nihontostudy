Yes I think this is a Repo also, but maybe late 20th \ncentu=\r\nry as a guess. It&#39;s a copy, I believe of a K=F4 Sh=F4ami tsuba that was \nor=\r\niginally done in a soft metal (Yamagane from memory) in the Momoyama \nperio=\r\nd, or perhaps a bit earlier.\n\nAnyway. as I said, I think this is a very mod=\r\nern repo, just my opinioon \nnayway.\n\nCheers\n\nRichard\n\n\n\ndarpa_ems wrote:\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; I&#39;ve had this tsuba for well over 20 years, & have wondered what info\n&gt; t=\r\nhere might be on it... It&#39;s a rabbit & waves design, with no ID marks.\n&gt; It=\r\n&#39;s iron, about 8cm x 8.5cm x 4mm. I believe it&#39;s a early 20th\n&gt; cent. repro=\r\n, at least I kind of hope it is, as it&#39;s been on several of\n&gt; my practice s=\r\nwords over the years... When I got it it had a nice solid\n&gt; brown patina, b=\r\nut enough rust scaling to need cleaning with a wirewheel.\n&gt;\n&gt; Pics are here=\r\n-\n&gt; http://ph.groups.yahoo.com/group/nihontostudy/photos/browse/e85a \n&gt; &lt;ht=\r\ntp://ph.groups.yahoo.com/group/nihontostudy/photos/browse/e85a&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Any tho=\r\nughts would be greatly appreciated.
