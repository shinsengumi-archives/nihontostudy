A member of McClafferty Sensei&#39;s dojo called and told me. I\nremember him from the Houston sword shows 20 years ago. What a riot he was.\nWhen that guy walked in teh room he sort of took over. Bad jokes and teh\nwhole bit. Fearless. A lot of fun to be around. I spoke to him a few months\nago and he was weak then. But he survived so long with his desease I\nunderstand it has not been done before. God bless him and his family.
