Obviously the &#39;armorer&#39; who mounted the sword \nknew nothing about swords, nor cared!  I believe that, like in the US \nduring the war, people donated swords to the government (in the US it \nwas fighting knives) for issue to new officers.  I don&#39;t believe that \nevery &#39;ancestral&#39; blade in a Gunto or Kaigunto mount was mounted by \nthe family of an officer with a &#39;family&#39; blade.  When swords were \nneeded, many were donated to the cause; be it the invasion of China \nand Manchuria or WW2.  That one sword told me that the armories were \nmerely making sharp shiny things for the military and that is as far \nas their knowledge went.  This is speculation, of course, but it \nmakes sense to me especially with some of the swords I have seen.\n\n\n"
