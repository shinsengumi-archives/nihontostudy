Kawai Hisayuki was a  \nTokugawa vassal who made swords for pleasure. His given name was  \nKametaro, his Go was Shoseishi, he had a son, Kawai Hisataka who  \nsucceeded to the name of Hisayuki. The Shodai Hisayuki died in Tokyo  \nin Sept. 1868, his son died in Tokyo in 1886. I believe the temple  \nthey are buried in is called the Ryuyoji.\n\tAny of this fit your genealogy? would be cool if he was a long lost  \ncousin...\n-t\n\nOn Aug 20, 2007, at 12:25 PM, kiwi57 KAWAI wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; I have a Kawai Hisayoshi in my lineage, but I&#39;m wondering if  \n&gt; Hisayuki is\n&gt; there also...
