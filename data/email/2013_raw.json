I&#39;ve found that isopropyl alcohol is &quot;patina safe&quot; and good for removing some of the junk that winds up on tsuba.  (Although if your tsuba has a patina &quot;enhanced&quot; by wax it will come off.)  I don&#39;t know if it&#39;ll work on sumi.  There is sumi ink remover for getting stains out of fibers:\n\n  http://www.shodokai.com/shop/product_info.php?cPath=33_36_46&products_id=110&PHPSESSID=5766575043bd7ac2cb2e9b6ce3d12734\n\n  I have no idea if it would work or if it would affect the patina.  My guess is that it&#39;s an enzymatic stain remover like Nature&#39;s Miracle.\n\n  Sumi should be mostly carbon with some glue binder.    Since there&#39;s nothing for it to soak into here it may just come off with water and some brushing.\n\n  Jim\n\n\n\n    All-\n          Yes yes, I&#39;m back thank you very much, no applause please. Here is a \n    kodogu question for the group. How does one remove SUMI, as in india \n    ink, from iron, without of course damaging the patina. Sitting here \n    with a tsuba in my back pocket and my enquirin&#39; mind wants to know...\n    -t\n\n\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n        Yahoo!
