Enjoyed seeing lots of familiar faces and some good  \n&gt; swords. People are still submitting stuff they shouldn&#39;t, however. I  \n&gt; do hope the level of study continues to improve. A lot of the guys  \n&gt; who have been with this for some time now did very well with some  \n&gt; only getting one or two rejections. Nonetheless, the younger and less  \n&gt; experienced guys need some guidance. I think the clubs are best for  \n&gt; that. Still, when the front desk tells you not to submit your  \n&gt; numbered and stamped gunto and you do anyway, I guess there is not  \n&gt; much that can be done. We are trying to have a traveling shinsa every  \n&gt; year with Chicago up next. I hope we can continue to see fewer  \n&gt; rejections. Oh, the show also seems to have been well attended on  \n&gt; Saturday. I gave a short talk similar to the one in San Francisco,  \n&gt; and it was a pretty good turn out for a one off event.\n\n&gt; Gordon\n\nI was not able to make it for the show and had two swords I was going to\nsubmit for shinsa. One already had NBTHK attribution at Juyo level and\nas it was a mumei, I was interested in alternate attributions.\n\nAs I didn&#39;t make it, neither were submitted.\n\nDoes the NTHK accept such blades? I was told somewhat vaguely that they\nmay not so I would like to know if I should bother submitting things\nlike this in the future?\n\nThanks,\n\n- darcy\n\n-- \nNOTICE: This email is private communication for the named recipients\nonly.
