Also\na sword book (maybe by the same author). I also got\ninto teh back room of the National Museum to see their\ntsuba collection. They had 3 swords, and about 300\ntsuba. The lady administrator gave me an autographed\nbook she had written about Japanese arts. I have meant\nto write about that since then. Maybe now I can get\naround to it. If you would like I can post the address\nof the publisher.
