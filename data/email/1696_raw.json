I have created an album under Verne and they are pics of \na sword I just found at an antique shop.Would like some opinons, not \nsigned. Could be a shorted katana bordering on wakasashi length. The \nsword had just been brought in by a WW2 vet&#39;s widow of which he will \ngive me her name to verify the story.I need help on identifying the \nhamo, it is active and on both side there are a couple of pea shaped \ntemper spots floating over the main temper.\nThanks\nVerne\n\n\n"
