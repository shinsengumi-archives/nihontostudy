I\n&gt; thought it was Yoshi something to begin with.\n&gt;\n&gt; For our tsuba experts here, In Tsuba, an Aesthetic guide it states that\n&gt; the first Umetada smiths signed with a different characture for Ume.\n&gt; They used ?. Then a little later on they changed to ?, the same i think\n&gt; as is on my mei. Then a little later on again, they changed back to ? or\n&gt; used a plum rebus instead of a kanji in the place of Ume. The book does\n&gt; not give the dates for these changes but I assume it was in the late\n&gt; Koto/early Edo period, around the time of the First or second\n&gt; generations. The other thing is that it may be is Ko-Umetada but I am\n&gt; looking further into that.\n&gt;\n&gt; any thought&#39;s on this ??\n&gt;\n&gt; Rich\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
