It was\nthin -  3 mm - and rather small, but showed a wonderful delamination flaw\nand a very sabishii set of 4 &#39;arrow fletch&#39; cut-outs. It clearly is an old\nsoldier that I&#39;ll bet you dates from the later Muromachi period. I rather\nlike these things, but this one was in  &quot;as found condition&quot; which meant it\nwas terribly dirty and seemingly covered with red rust and some kind of\nreally noxious pucky. At first I thought that I should just throw it in the\njunk box, but decided to give it a bit of &#39;treatment.&#39;\n      After a good boiling, it was clean enough to show the laminations,\nbut it was also entirely bright. In that condition It wouldn&#39;t look good\neven in the junk box, so I invited it to have a bit of color. It responded\nnicely, but it was now rather fresh. Here&#39;s the tip I discovered. I used a\nbit of boar tusk to &quot;bone&quot; the surface. I used this in the usual way, to\nburnish the flat surfaces and clean out the sukashi and the rim. I was VERY\nimpresses that the tusk seemed to work better than the antler does. It was\nnot hard enough to scratch the surface so that it left no bright  lines. It\nalso was hard enough to leave not dusty residue on the surface. But it did\na nice job of finishing the surface and quickly turned it a nice dark\nblue/black. With a dab of oil, and in less than an hour, this tsuba went\nfrom a questionable buy to a presentable piece I was pleased to hang with\nmy other swordsmith guards.\n      I could never have done this sort of thing with a finer or more\nvaluable tsuba, but in this case I felt I not getting beyond my\ncapabilities and also that I was preserving an old guard that was &#39;at\nrisk.&#39; From now one, I am going to use the harder tusk rather than antler.\nAhhh the joys of collecting\n\n\nPeter Bleed\n\n\n"
