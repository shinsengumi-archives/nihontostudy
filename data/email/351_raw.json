A hole is drilled with a tool steel \nbit.  In punching, the smith heats up the section of the nakago to \nred heat, and using a round steel punch, hammers a deep dimple on one \nside.  He then turns the blade over and centers the punch over the \ndimple on the other side, and whacks it with a hammer.  Done \ncorrectly, a small, round coin is ejected, and the hole is complete.  \nFresh punched holes will show rounded shoulders, and may show in the \ninterior the section where the little coin broke off.  Drilled holes \nwill have sharp, square shoulders, and uniform walls, likely showing \nspiral marks on the sides.  I believe most of the WWII traditional \nnihonto had punched ana, but don&#39;t know what percentage of non-\ntraditional gunto had drilled ana.\n\nNC\n\n--- In nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Matthew E.
