I don&#39;t know whether cutting test inscriptions were initially filed\nflush with the surface of the nakago or not.  If the inlay was raised at all\nthere won&#39;t be a reference point.  Also, an old but false cutting test or\nattribution would presumably have the same &quot;depth&quot; as a correct one of the\nsame age.  I wouldn&#39;t take it as a certain test of the validity of an inlaid\ninscription.\n:\n: I heard another tidbit about Umetada habaki once that I haven&#39;t been able\nto verify.  Their habaki are certainly of very high quality and the\nconstruction and finish are distinctive, but I was told that the Umetada\nwere exceptionally good at fitting habaki to o-suriage swords.  I&#39;m not sure\nwhat to make of that... anyone have any ideas?  I&#39;ve certainly seen Umetada\nhabaki on ubu tanto, so their type is not strictly developed for the nakago\nof shortened blades.\n:\n: Jim\n:\n:\n:\n:   Wow Jim, these are exactly the pearls I like to hear. Incredible ! When\n:   you think about it, it makes complete sense, but I doubt anyone would\n:   ever take the trouble to figure something like that out over here.\n:\n:   Now, we can tell the fake cutting tests from the genuine ones with a\n:   simple swoop. Very much appreciated, this info is, thanks Jim !\n:\n:   - Matt\n:\n:\n: [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n:\n:\n:\n: To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n: nihontostudy-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n:\n:\n:\n: Your use of Yahoo!
