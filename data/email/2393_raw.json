This sounds like the worst kind of popular \n&gt; western mythology, right up there with &quot;don&#39;t resheath the sword\nwithout \n&gt; blood on the blade.&quot;\n\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Bob\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ranox27157@y... wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; But a good clue to a family sword is the\n&gt; &gt; the etching or engraving of a name on the blade. That is the name of \n&gt; &gt; a warrior killed by the sword (and by placing the warriors name on \n&gt; &gt; the blade, his soul is captured in the steel).\n&gt; \n&gt;   I would like any comments on the blade directed\n&gt; &gt; to me personally. &lt; Ranox27157@y... &gt; Should it turn out that \n&gt; &gt; this is one of the presentation swords, but without a legal issue, I \n&gt; &gt; will either sell it or donate in to the loical WWII museum.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
