I also have a large pair of &quot;running boar&quot; menuki signed Shozui which have the same star-shape roots. Not holding out that these are correct as signed, but I have seen this thing on at least one pair of menuki by Shozui (am I spelling this right?). Any comment on the use of this star-shape roots? Characteristic of any era or maker? Just curious. \n\nRon\nSTL\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: Jim Gilbert \n  To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Tuesday, August 10, 2004 5:50 PM\n  Subject: Re: [nihontostudy] menuki question\n\n\n  Milt,\n  They&#39;d probably be attributed to Edo Kinko.  I don&#39;t think that getting an attribution to a school would be very likely.  FWIW, the style of the Nio in &quot;052F&quot; was used by Yokoya Somin.  His Juyo Bunkazai Nio futakoromono from the Kyoto National Museum was on display in Washington DC about five years ago in the big Art of Edo show at the National Gallery.  It would have been worth the trip even if that was the only thing to see.\n\n  Jim\n\n\n\n    please klick...............\n\n    http://tinyurl.com/4lqsp\n\n    these are my Nio menuki. I know menuki is hard to &quot; kantei &quot;, but any \n    opinion as to school is appreciated.\n\n    Gorby....... shoami is unacceptable.\n\n\n    milt\n\n\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n        Yahoo!
