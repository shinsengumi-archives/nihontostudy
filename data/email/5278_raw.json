There is no school name included. I am \npretty sure the name is Hidemichi. The other three characters on the right side \nbegin with Ry&#251; or dragon. The next two I cannot read. I have asked my wife to take \na look. I have check the Kink&#244; Dictionary and there is a listing for Hidemichi, but it \ndoes not give his pseudonym. There are a couple of other possibilities for the \nsecond character of the name. It looks like Michi, but it could also be Hideyuki \ndepending on the number of strokes in the character. Terunori is also a possiblilty \nwith the same characters as Hideyuki, just a different reading. Unfortunately, none \nof these artists use the pseudonym shown on your tsuba.\n\nGordon\n\n"
