With the average price of a blank cd under $1 and a DVD under $4 ( i&#39;m talking ozy $ here ), the oly real expence would be shipping. And with online, as long as the file sizes are kept managable then they are basically free. We have software here that produes flash files that make files of good quality at about 1 - 2 meg per minute with audio and this is quite acceptable I think. Of course the joy of CD/DVD is it is either full screen or close to it.\n\nEither way, it&#39;s all good and would offer a lot to everyone, even as a reminder to those who went to the lectures or shows.\n\nRich\n\n\n\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: Jim Gilbert \n  To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Friday, November 21, 2003 10:59 AM\n  Subject: Re: [nihontostudy] Re: the state of things What&#39;s Next?\n\n\n  Creating a distribution channel for this stuff is important.  There is a lot of material that is in circulation among friends and at clubs.  For example, our own Tom Helm made a nice videotape of an NTHK group visit to a swordsmith in Kamakura.  I got a VHS copy from Tom and have shown the tape at our NY shibu meeting and loaned it out to friends.  That&#39;s all very good, but the material hasn&#39;t traveled as far or freely as it could. \n\n  An online or disc-based way to distribute this stuff would not only make more of the existing material, but would also create an incentive to make the effort to record more.  We haven&#39;t taped Gordon&#39;s lectures for example.  If the tape is only going to circulate between a few friends, it&#39;s not too motivating to take the time to do it.  OTOH, if we know that there&#39;s a place for it on the web there&#39;s a much bigger motivation to capture it.  \n\n  I don&#39;t think that the old model of selling a video for $39.95 (or a lot more) will go anywhere.  If it can be put online or sold for a few bucks or as part of membership dues on disc it&#39;ll have an audience.  Not a money maker, but a way to distribute information.\n\n  Jim\n\n\n\n    I too would be happy to offer any help in translating vision from Video/Film to CD/DVD. We have all the technology in my office and with all permissions I would offer this for nothing ( except maybe the stock/disk cost, this could be worked out somehow ) if interested.\n\n    This is a very good idea. To see Yumoto sensei in the flesh would be great, especially for those of us who know of him only in his books.\n\n    Rich Turner\n\n\n\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n        Yahoo!
