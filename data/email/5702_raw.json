I&#39;ve come to admire &quot;his&quot; persistence, although he&#39;s probably a\nboiler room somewhere rather than an individual.\n\nI&#39;m afraid that Gordon may be waving his cane and yelling at the kids to\nstay off his lawn before long...\n\nI had a chance to look at a very interesting tsuba recently. It&#39;s a typical\nbird in the plum tree Higo guard, but what&#39;s interesting is that it wasn&#39;t\ncompleted. The design is scribed into the plate and all of the roughing out\nwas done with a chisel. Even the outline of the rim is chiseled in with\nmultiple cuts from both sides. It looks like a slight gouge was used while\ncutting the rim and most of the sukashi was cut with a straight chisel.\n\nA couple of sections of sukashi have some file work done, but the rest is\nstill rough. It looks like one of the thin branches was chiseled down too\nthin to be finished properly and the piece was abandoned. The color of the\nguard isn&#39;t bad (even though I doubt any patina was applied) and the build\nup on the interior sukashi walls looks about like you&#39;d expect for an Edo\npiece.\n\nI recently spent two weeks shooting in Baja Sur, Mexico. A great place,\nother than the developed Cabo area on the southern tip. \n\nA few wildlife photos from both the Pacific and Gulf sides:\n\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/jggilbert/sets/72157623839030000/\n\nJim\n\nwww.jimgilbertphoto.com\n\n--- In nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com &lt;mailto:nihontostudy%40yahoogroups.com&gt;\n, Richard Turner &lt;ikkanshi@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; and I think julius_lopez82@... asked a legit question on Ichimonji ?\n&gt; \n&gt; I had a quick check and Jim&#39;s deleted someone named nicemaletrust who \n&gt; keeps coming back bit thats all I see.\n&gt; \n&gt; cheers\n&gt; \n&gt; Rich\n&gt; \n\n\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
