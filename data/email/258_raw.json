They are called tagane mei.  Various Higo tsubako used groups of marks at the top and bottom of the nakago ana, some of which are specific to individual makers.  The Tosa Myochin group used a group of distinctive angled chisel marks at the top of the nakago ana, although I&#39;m not aware of any individual Tosa makers being identified by a specific tagane mei.  Hirata Hikozo and some Saotome and Tembo used large, round punches along the sides of the nakago ana.  Many Kyo-sukashi tsuba have a distinctive deep rectangular punching along the sides of the nakago ana, but I haven&#39;t seen published research on this.  \n\nOther chiseling appears to be purely functional, though.  Generally sekigane are used to fit the top and bottom of the nakago and to the nakago.  Occasionally you see sekigane on the sides of the nakago ana as well, but usually the sides appear to have been adjusted by punching the plate in.\n\nSo, some are there to fit to swords, some are there as a group or individual mark.  It&#39;s an important thing to take note of as you study tsuba.\nJim\n\n\n  Fellow tsuba collectors,\n\n  I am not totally convinced that those chisel marks   around the nakago -ana \n  are there to fit the sword nakago better to the tsuba.\n  After collecting a few  tsuba, I am beginning to see some similar pattern in \n  the chisel marks.\n  Don&#39;t you all think to get a &quot; tighter/custom &quot; fit , it&#39;s easier  to add the \n  sekigane  than to hammer the iron to narrow the gap, if you may ?\n\n  opinion, anyone ?\n\n  Milt \n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
