Cary suggested it\nwould be best to submit these in Japan and it got me\nthinking about many questions surrounding this\nprocess.  I don&#39;t recall a lot of discussion around\nfittings submission, but there have been many\ndiscussions on submiting swords. So I thought it would\nbe helpful (for at least some of us or at least me).\n1.  When is it worth submitting fittings to shinsa?  I\nunderstand the value of knowledge but aren&#39;t fees a\nlittle high for fittings in relation to swords? \n2. Is the process similiar to swords, must submit\nseveral times for higher papers? \n2.  What criteria would you use? for example, price: a\n$250 tsuba may not but a $500 would? or age a late edo\npiece isn&#39;t worth it?\n3.  A sword with papers usually increases value (often\ngreatly(?)).  How much would this apply to tsuba\nand/or fittings in general?\n4. What kind of conditions must your tsuba be in for a\nreal consideration? patina, rust, missing inlay, etc? \n5. Does age factor into condition, ie koto swords may\nhave certain flaws overlooked in the papering process\nbut shinto would not, does this translate over to\ntsuba?\n\nAll comments are appreciated.  By the way, the 2 tsuba\nI was questioning are located in the other yahoo list\nfolder under mantis (I think labeled &quot;11 &1&quot;) which\nwere recently shared with on that list.  Anyone else\ninterested I will gladly send pics of.  \n\nThank you\nKen\n\n\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nSBC Yahoo!
