The motif is of \n  flowering plum branches, correct?\n\n  Gordon\n\n  On 2006/03/20, at 8:28, Jim Gilbert wrote:\n\n  &gt; I have added scans of the other side of the tsuba to the folder below. \n  &gt;  I forgot to mention the dimensions again, so for the record they are \n  &gt; 90.1 mm H x 84.1 mm W x 5.0 - 5.5 mm thick at the mimi.\n  &gt;\n  &gt; The maker is Nobuie and the signature is of the type now called \n  &gt; futoji-mei \u001b$BB@;zLC\u001b(B (bold, thick).  Within both the hanare and futoji-mei \n  &gt; types there is considerable variation in the detail of the signatures. \n  &gt;  This example is not one of the more boldly executed futoji-mei.  As \n  &gt; Pete crypictically indicated, an oshigata of this guard is published \n  &gt; in Nakamura Kakudayu and Akiyama Kyusaku&#39;s 1926 Nobuie Tsuba shu \n  &gt; (#52).  There the signature is described as sumari-mei \u001b$B5M$jLC\u001b(B (&quot;close \n  &gt; packed&quot;), which is one of the older terms now included within the \n  &gt; futoji-mei type.  This guard is described as futoji-mei in several \n  &gt; later books and in the NBTHK&#39;s attribution.\n  &gt;\n  &gt; The hitsuana had not yet been filled when the oshigata was made.  This \n  &gt; guard was the property of the Okubo daimyo family in Odawara until it \n  &gt; was sold in 1931, so the ana were likely filled by the new owner.  It \n  &gt; is unlikely that they are original to the plate given that they are \n  &gt; made such that the guard would be mounted with the unsigned side as \n  &gt; the front.  The shapes of the hitsuana are unusual.   It was clearly \n  &gt; mounted with an o-kozuka, which are typically 18-20 mm wide (vs. the \n  &gt; standard size of 14-15 mm).  As Gordon mentioned, the small size of \n  &gt; the kogai-ana suggests it was mounted with one of the narrow style \n  &gt; ko-Mino kogai.  The opening is too small to accommodate a standard \n  &gt; 14-15 mm wide kogai.\n  &gt;\n  &gt; The early Edo period &quot;betsujin&quot; (different person) Nobuie work will \n  &gt; lack the quality in the metal, tekkotsu, finish and carving.  The \n  &gt; plates are usually rather characterless and the working lacks \n  &gt; subtlety.  The late Edo period revival pieces do indeed try to emulate \n  &gt; the finish of the originals and as Alan mentioned some do a fairly \n  &gt; good job.  In general, the working of the rim is a bit forced and \n  &gt; overdone in these examples compared to the originals.  They obviously \n  &gt; will look young, but there is also a somewhat artificial quality to \n  &gt; them.  The same feeling comes from later copies of early Shino and \n  &gt; Oribe ceramics.\n  &gt;\n  &gt; The metal, tekkotsu and yakite finish should lead to an Owari origin.  \n  &gt; Remember that Kaneie worked in Kyoto, and everything about his guards \n  &gt; is in line with Kyoto methods and aesthetics.\n  &gt;\n  &gt; That&#39;s all I can think of at the moment.\n  &gt;\n  &gt; Jim\n  &gt;\n  &gt;\n  &gt;\n  &gt;   The photos for kantei problem number three can be viewed here:\n  &gt;\n  &gt;   http://ph.groups.yahoo.com/group/nihontostudy/photos/browse/3108\n  &gt;\n  &gt;   Jim\n  &gt;\n  &gt;\n  &gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n  &gt;\n  &gt;\n  &gt;\n  &gt;\n  &gt; Yahoo!
