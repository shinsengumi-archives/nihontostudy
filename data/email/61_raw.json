How common would this have been, I can see how it would effect the centre of balance on the sword itself, obviously pulling the centre of balance back to the tsuba or there abouts. I thought, and correct me if I am wrong, that those who could afford a descent sword in the old days would have had it made to suite their height, arm length etc. I assume this would only be needed if coming into procession of a sword that was originally made for someone else.\n\nRich\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
