I\ndon&#39;t know how much later. I&#39;m just basing my opinion\noff the seppa dai and some of the other measurements.\nMaybe yours is 50 to 100 years younger than the\nko-umetada photographed. My confidence level isn&#39;t\nsuper high though, so don&#39;t quote me. Just sticking my\nneck out to risk an opinion.\n\nAs to the black lacquer- thats your call. If the\nlacquer is fair to good quality, I personally would be\ninclined to leave it. I&#39;m of the minimally invasive\nschool of thought. Clean it to a preservation point of\nview.\n   If the lacquer is well done and has survived this\nlong, I consider it part of the atmosphere of the\npiece. If its a hack job, boil away.\n\nCurran\n\n\n\n\n--- David Zincavage &lt;jdz@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; I have a tsuba which has a certain amount of what\n&gt; looks like black lacquer remaining on a minority of\n&gt; its surface.  Should I be boiling this tsuba, trying\n&gt; to remove whatever is left?  Or should I preserve it\n&gt; as is? \n&gt; \n&gt; An almost identical tsuba (evidently without\n&gt; lacquer) is identified in Haynes catalogue 2 as &quot;Ko\n&gt; Umetada style.&quot; \n&gt; \n&gt; http://zincavage.org/KoUmetada.html\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?
