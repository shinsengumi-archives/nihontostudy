The style of the sukashi is more like Kyo work, \nthough.  It&#39;s difficult to judge iron from photographs, but it \ndoesn&#39;t look typically Owari.  I&#39;ve seen guards that looked quite \nlike Owari be judged as Shoami because of uncertainty over the lack \nof some classic characteristic or other.  Some of these sukashi \npieces can be very difficult to pigeonhole with confidence because \nthey share characteristics of Kyo and Owari.  My guess is that your \nguard would be attributed to Shoami.  Probably early Edo period or a \nbit older.\n&gt; \n&gt;   The other guard is interesting.  Some of that type have plates \nlike Kamakura bori and have a simple carving around the rim.  Others \nhave plates more like Onin guards.  Both types can have a simple \nring or two of brass inlay.  I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve seen an example that \nhas the rim hammered like yours, but aesthetically it seems like the \nsame idea as the carved decoration seen on others.\n&gt; \n&gt;   The style of the plate, the shape of the kozuka ana and the \nsimple inlay decoration would all point to an Onin attribution.    \nHow thick is it?  Probably mid Muromachi at least.\n&gt; \n&gt;   Jim\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;     Gentlemen:\n&gt; \n&gt;     I really have problems with attribution on these early tsuba:\n&gt;     http://www.nihontophile.com/Suk1.jpg\n&gt;     http://www.nihontophile.com/Suk2.jpg\n&gt;     http://www.nihontophile.com/Suk3.jpg\n&gt;     Tsuba is 7.2 tall x 6.9 cm wide; 4 mm thick at the mimi.\n&gt;     I first thought Ko-Shoami because of the fine sukashi work.\n&gt;     But it looks Owari (and has bones in the rim). However it is \non the \n&gt;     small side..which would place it late but it looks early and \nhas \n&gt;     obviously been mounted many times.\n&gt;     What about Kyo-Shoami?\n&gt;     (perhaps some day I will get it down.....:)\n&gt; \n&gt;     Also this tsuba has given me a fit as to attribution/age:\n&gt;     http://www.nihontophile.com/html/gallery.html\n&gt; \n&gt;     Any help would be much appreciated.\n&gt; \n&gt;     Kind regards,\n&gt;     Ron P.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;           Yahoo!
