(I guess it s=\r\ntrongly suggested that the \niron pieces are tsubas and not anything else.)\n=\r\nThe way To-yo combined into new Kanji phrase is unique to Japan. It \nindica=\r\nts that the tsuba could be dated as early as when emperor \nMeiji came to po=\r\nwer or even earlier as I would explain later. \nWestern metal processing tec=\r\nhnique was then not yet introduced into \nJapan. This probably explains why =\r\nthe quality of workmanship appears \nto be out dated. \nMeteorite of all kind=\r\n have their own earth age respectively \nmeasurable counting from the day th=\r\ney reached the globe. \nI hope someday some scientists would be interested e=\r\nnough in doing \nthe dating for this tsuba.\nOnce determined of its age peopl=\r\ne could better tell its background \nby linking its age with history of Sino=\r\n-Japanese cultural enchange. \nTsuba or any other name one might have it cal=\r\nled I am sure it must \nhave been a part of one very unusual martial sword e=\r\nxactly as the \ninscription illustrated. \nThe owner of which could be rather=\r\n important so qualifiable to claim \nthe ownership of the rare iron meteorit=\r\ne. Who is this man? I wonder. \nBy inscripting tsuba with &quot;TO-YO(oriental) M=\r\nARTIAL SWORD&quot; The sword \nmust have been made with an western reciepient in =\r\nmind. Again an \nimportant figure. Who is this western man?\nHere comes one i=\r\nnteresting question. Why the Japanese craftman did \nnot inscribe the said t=\r\nsuba straight forwardly with &quot;Japanese \nmartial sword&quot;?\nPlease note that du=\r\nring Chinese Ming dynasty, which is earlier than \nMeiji period, Japan shipp=\r\ned a lot of porcelain art to Europe bearing \nmostly Chinese designs. And re=\r\nmarkable portioned of them marked with \nChinese way of dating. \n(This was h=\r\nappened when China sealed its seaport to contain its own \npeople within.) \n=\r\nJapanese porcelain exporters were aiming to impress European buyers \nthat t=\r\nhe porcelain they shipped were of China origin. For in \nEuropean&#39;s mind the=\r\nn whatever oriental was mysteriously Chinese. \nSomewhere in Japan long ago =\r\nthere might have been a recorded \nmeteoric fall. An iron meteor broke into =\r\nmany pieces before falling. \nThere in the local museum some specimen could =\r\nstill be found. What \nif this tsuba happens to contain exactly same content=\r\n as the \nexsisting ones? \nShould that be the case I would be happy to laon =\r\nmy tsuba to that \nJapanese museum for the sake of happy reunion -- after ma=\r\nny \ncenturies of roaming.\n\nChen, Yingchaw\nTaipei\nPhoto File titled SOSIDORE=\r\n\n\n--- In nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Dr John P Lissenden&quot; \n&lt;docliss@j...=\r\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; While I cannot add any knowledge to &quot;sosidore&quot;&#39;s on the subjec=\r\nt of \n&gt; meteoric iron, I cannot let his comments pass without making some \n=\r\nof \n&gt; my own.\n&gt; \n&gt; The two artefacts that he illustrates, with their square=\r\n \napertures,  \n&gt; demonstrate a common enigma in deciding what use they were=\r\n \nintended \n&gt; for.  They were clearly not intended for mounting on a Japane=\r\nse \n&gt; sword and, for this reason cannot be considered to be &#39;tsuba&#39;.  \n&gt; Ne=\r\nither is this aperture compatible with the tang of a Chinese \n&gt; sword, and =\r\nmy own belief is that such artefacts were intended for \n&gt; mounting on a tie=\r\n-jian, or Chinese &#39;fighting stick&#39;.\n&gt; \n&gt; The question of their nickel conte=\r\nnt can surely be resolved, \neither \n&gt; by modern physical tecniques such as =\r\nlaser micro-spectral or \natomic \n&gt; absorption spectral analysis.  Surely th=\r\ne effect of the forging \n&gt; process would be to more evenly distribute the n=\r\nickel thoughout \nthe \n&gt; base metal?  Much more simply, the simple measureme=\r\nnt of their \n&gt; density might be a guide.\n&gt; \n&gt; As for the use of mercuric gi=\r\nlding, this is clealy only \npracticable \n&gt; on copper artefacts or on those =\r\nof the soft-metal alloys \ncontaining \n&gt; this element.  Before the use of th=\r\nis gilding tecnique on iron, \nthe \n&gt; artefact needs to be coated with a cop=\r\nper film, and this can \n&gt; normally be seen where the gold has subsequently =\r\nseparated.\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards, John L.\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com, =\r\n&quot;sosidore&quot; &lt;sosidore@y...&gt; \n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Dear all,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; In Chinese =\r\ndocumented 4000 years of history meteorite have long \n&gt; been \n&gt; &gt; regarded =\r\nas precious materials. Ancient Chinese craftsmen \n&gt; processed \n&gt; &gt; stone me=\r\nteorites into varieties of item for religious \nworshipping \n&gt; &gt; purposes. I=\r\n guess iron meteorites were also used for same \n&gt; purposes. \n&gt; &gt; Only they =\r\nweathered away in time sooner than their stonny \ncounter \n&gt; part. \n&gt; &gt; I po=\r\nsted once again 2 iron tsubas onto my folder entitled \n&gt; SOSIDORE. \n&gt; &gt; Thi=\r\ns time they revealed cleared gilded finish. \n&gt; &gt; I suspeceted they were mad=\r\ne of iron meteorite based on following \n&gt; &gt; reasons.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 1. They are l=\r\nighter than iron.\n&gt; &gt; Iron meteorites are rarely pure iron. They usually co=\r\nntain \nnickel. \n&gt; Some \n&gt; &gt; meteorites contain plenty of iron. They are hea=\r\nvy in weight and \n&gt; &gt; weathered away much sooner. Some iron meteorites cont=\r\nain plenty \nof \n&gt; &gt; nickel. They are apparently lighter and can better resi=\r\nst \nweather. \n&gt; The \n&gt; &gt; two iron tsubas showed here are relatively light. =\r\nThey showed \n&gt; &gt; superficial rusting only, evidencing higher content of nic=\r\nkel. \n&gt; Initial \n&gt; &gt; observations support the idea that they might be once =\r\na part of \nan \n&gt; iron \n&gt; &gt; meteorite with considerable content of nickel.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; The chiseled holes revealed a secret about the distribution of \n&gt; &gt; mate=\r\nrials within tsubas are not even. Again it points to a \n&gt; possibility \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nthat the tsuba materials could have been iron-nickel alloy with \n&gt; content =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; of which not evenly distributed. And this is characteristics \nquite \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; common in case of meteorite.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I purchased these two iron tsubas =\r\nfrom a Chinese vendor who used \n&gt; to \n&gt; &gt; sell antiques. There is strong po=\r\nssibility these twp artifacts \n&gt; were \n&gt; &gt; unearthed in China.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The=\r\ny way these 2 iron tsubas gilded was typical Chinese. \nHowever, \n&gt; I am \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; pretty sure that in Japan mirror craftsman followed exactly same \n&gt; metho=\r\nd \n&gt; &gt; in treating mirror surface with mercury. The same technique can \n&gt; c=\r\nome \n&gt; &gt; out with gilded finish when adding gold-grains into the mixture \no=\r\nf \n&gt; &gt; rubbed-on materials. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Now, I am wondering if these two iron=\r\n tsubas were of Japanese \n&gt; origin.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The most convincing clues of a=\r\nll are the inscriptions. \n&gt; &gt; 1. Chinese way of arranging characters always=\r\n comes from top \ndown \n&gt; and \n&gt; &gt; from left to right. In this case. They ar=\r\ne to be read from top \n&gt; down \n&gt; &gt; then left to right.\n&gt; &gt; 2. The content o=\r\nf inscriptions are typical Japanese.\n&gt; &gt; 3. The style of fonts are typicall=\r\ny Japanese.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The three points mentioned excluded the possibility th=\r\nat they \nwere \n&gt; &gt; originally made in China. Even if they were once contrac=\r\nted with \n&gt; &gt; Chinese craftsmen made to Japanese order the font of characte=\r\nrs \n&gt; &gt; concerned betrayed the fact that Chinese people never trained to \n&gt;=\r\n write \n&gt; &gt; nor processed kanji onto surface of any materials in Japanese \n=\r\n&gt; style. \n&gt; &gt; Only Japanese can..  \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; For sure these two iron trubas=\r\n are not isolated case. I wonder \n&gt; where \n&gt; &gt; are the rest of them and in =\r\nwhat form? Anyone knows any record \n&gt; about \n&gt; &gt; iron meteorite processed i=\r\nnto any other type of items that \nbecame \n&gt; part \n&gt; &gt; of Nihonto?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nSOSIDORE\n&gt; &gt; Chen, Ying-chaw\n&gt; &gt; Taipei\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n"
