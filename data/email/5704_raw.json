I&#39;ve come to admire &quot;his&quot; persistence, although he&#39;s probably a\n&gt; boiler room somewhere rather than an individual.\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m afraid that Gordon may be waving his cane and yelling at the kids to\n&gt; stay off his lawn before long...\n&gt;\n&gt; I had a chance to look at a very interesting tsuba recently. It&#39;s a \n&gt; typical\n&gt; bird in the plum tree Higo guard, but what&#39;s interesting is that it wasn&#39;t\n&gt; completed. The design is scribed into the plate and all of the \n&gt; roughing out\n&gt; was done with a chisel. Even the outline of the rim is chiseled in with\n&gt; multiple cuts from both sides. It looks like a slight gouge was used while\n&gt; cutting the rim and most of the sukashi was cut with a straight chisel.\n&gt;\n&gt; A couple of sections of sukashi have some file work done, but the rest is\n&gt; still rough. It looks like one of the thin branches was chiseled down too\n&gt; thin to be finished properly and the piece was abandoned. The color of the\n&gt; guard isn&#39;t bad (even though I doubt any patina was applied) and the build\n&gt; up on the interior sukashi walls looks about like you&#39;d expect for an Edo\n&gt; piece.\n&gt;\n&gt; I recently spent two weeks shooting in Baja Sur, Mexico. A great place,\n&gt; other than the developed Cabo area on the southern tip.\n&gt;\n&gt; A few wildlife photos from both the Pacific and Gulf sides:\n&gt;\n&gt; http://www.flickr.com/photos/jggilbert/sets/72157623839030000/\n&gt;\n&gt; Jim\n&gt;\n&gt; www.jimgilbertphoto.com\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n&gt; &lt;mailto:nihontostudy%40yahoogroups.com&gt; \n&gt; &lt;mailto:nihontostudy%40yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; , Richard Turner &lt;ikkanshi@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; and I think julius_lopez82@... asked a legit question on Ichimonji ?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I had a quick check and Jim&#39;s deleted someone named nicemaletrust who\n&gt; &gt; keeps coming back bit thats all I see.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; cheers\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Rich\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n&gt; \n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
