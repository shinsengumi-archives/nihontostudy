If it is not possible or pra=\r\nctical\n&gt; to take a picture, you might consider taking it to a\n&gt; sword club =\r\nnear you.\n&gt; \n&gt; Given the size and curvature of the blade, it is\n&gt; probably =\r\na wakizashi or a naginata-naoshi (a halberd\n&gt; like weapon that has been cut=\r\n down to make an oversize\n&gt; tanto. &quot;O-tanto&quot; basically is a large or oversi=\r\nzed\n&gt; tanto). The mounts sound fine to me. Many of these\n&gt; came back as sou=\r\nevinirs with WW2 veterans. As they\n&gt; played with them over the years, parts=\r\n &lt;handles,\n&gt; seppas, etc&gt; got mixed and matched.\n&gt; \n&gt; Don&#39;t mess with the b=\r\nlade using any cleaning\n&gt; chemicals. Despite the polish being gone and the =\r\nedge\n&gt; destroyed, there may be some life left to it.\n&gt; \n&gt; Please share in w=\r\nhat state or country you live, and we\n&gt; will try to point you to a nearby s=\r\nword society or\n&gt; club.\n&gt; \n&gt; Curran\n\n\n\n\n"
