I didn&#39;t see them i=\r\nn Tampa, but based on the photos they look like late Edo work.\n\nAgreed with=\r\n Gordon&#39;s earlier comment that there are plenty of early solid gold menuki,=\r\n including Ko-mino and Ko-Kinko work in addition to Goto.  The recent NBTHK=\r\n AB display and lecture at Tampa included several pairs of solid gold mainl=\r\nine Goto menuki from the Muromachi and early Edo periods.\n\nJim\n\n\n  ----- Or=\r\niginal Message ----- \n  From: Ron Hartmann \n  To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.=\r\ncom \n  Sent: Wednesday, February 27, 2008 7:31 PM\n  Subject: Re: [nihontost=\r\nudy] Kyo-kinko\n\n\n  Jim - \n\n  You may have seen these in Tampa but here is a=\r\n link showing the menuki that I was asking about: \n  http://www.nihonto.com=\r\n/11.3.07.html\n\n  Papered as Kyo-kinko, maybe these fall into that area as y=\r\nou mentioned where it is difficult to &quot;date&quot; them or to assign a maker.

It is often applied to work that is in Goto style but is not Goto main =\r\nor sideline work. Edo-kinko used to be used similarly for work in the style=\r\n of Edo region machibori kinko schools, but lately this is generally lumped=\r\n as &quot;Kyo-kinko&quot; as well. So it truly is a grab bag, but the problem (especi=\r\nally with menuki) is that there is so much Edo period kinko work with no un=\r\nique character to it that makes it possible to give a more specific attribu=\r\ntion.\n\n  BTW, generic Edo period kinko work of lower quality than Kyo-kinko=\r\n is attributed to Kyo-kanagushi.\n\n  Jim\n\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  =\r\nFrom: ROBSON Gordon \n  To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Wednesday,=\r\n February 27, 2008 4:23 PM\n  Subject: Re: [nihontostudy] Kyo-kinko\n\n  Hi Ro=\r\nn,\n\n  My understanding is that Kyo-Kinko is the new name for Waki-Goto. Thi=\r\ns would \n  make them a grab bag like Ko-Kinko or even Shoami. Their dates a=\r\nre post-Ko-\n  Kinko, so early Edo to Bakumatsu. There is a Kyo-Kinko book o=\r\nut there. I think the \n  title is Kyo-Kinko no Kenkyu (research into Kyo-Ki=\r\nnko) or something like that. Jim \n  is probably better up on this stuff the=\r\nn I am.\n\n  On on different note, good luck to Harry.
