I have a lot of books\n&gt; &gt; on Japanese Swords, but\n&gt; &gt; &gt; none of them have much on Tsubas.  I have a\n&gt; whole list of Books that Jim\n&gt; &gt; had up on his website,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; which I&#39;m trying to find out how to get some of\n&gt; them.  What books are\n&gt; &gt; really good and where can I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; get them?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Also, I purchased a set of Tsuba&#39;s from a Local\n&gt; Auction House in Portland,\n&gt; &gt; Oregon and need to find\n&gt; &gt; &gt; info on them.
