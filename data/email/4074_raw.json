Alan&#39;s on the Owari Kinko was\nthe only one that had not crossed my mind yet. I do\nnot have the Owari book he mentioned, so Pete will\nhafta comment on that.\n\nTsuba #1:   Work is definitely better than what I know\nas Waki Goto. But I came across pieces that reminded\nme of it. They were described as &quot;&#39;Kaga Waki Goto&quot;.\n\nTsuba #2:   This is the better tsuba of the two. The\nsakudo is a beautiful ink color and the piece is\nrather heavy. The condition is extremely good. The\nshakudo is all a high polish luster. Not nanako. The\nquality of the work does remind me of the better Kaga\nI have seen. The gold inlay is 99% there, but missing\none tiny spot that helps to reveal that the channels\nand the gold inlay are rather deep.\n    This is the one that has me stumped the most.\nSomehow doesn&#39;t feel like Kaga work. The shape? The\nexecution of some of the curves & lines?\n    I definitely have a lot to learn. \n\nThank you for the help. If someone can expand on Owari\nkinko, I&#39;d like to know more about this work.\n\nCurran \nC^3\n\n\n\n--- Alan Bale &lt;abale@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; Hi Pete,\n&gt; It,s not Ikkodo (一光堁E, it is 興善寺 and\n&gt; covers various types of tsuba including some that I\n&gt; would say were pure Kaga-zogan, look in the Owari\n&gt; book at the back for examples.\n&gt; Alan\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt;   From: klepet33319 \n&gt;   To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n&gt;   Sent: Thursday, March 30, 2006 1:12 PM\n&gt;   Subject: [nihontostudy] Re: 2 new Tsuba to ask\n&gt; about / Kantei\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   Hi Alan -- Would that be the same as Owari\n&gt; Ikko-do?  There is a tsuba \n&gt;   on Tokugawa (tsuba page one bottom) which has that\n&gt; same look and goes \n&gt;   by that description.  I had not heard that term\n&gt; before.\n&gt;   Hope all is well.\n&gt;   Pete Klein\n&gt;   http://www.sanmei.com/shop_e/enter.html\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   --- In nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Alan Bale&quot;\n&gt; &lt;abale@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;   &gt;\n&gt;   &gt; I think the first tsuba may be Owari kinko, it\n&gt; has a feeling of \n&gt;   early Nagoya work when the quality was high. The\n&gt; second might also be \n&gt;   Owari kinko of the type called &#39;Kozenji&#39;, I am not\n&gt; sure what this \n&gt;   means as it seems to be a catchall term, is the\n&gt; plate nanako struck \n&gt;   over the gold lightning pattern?

I&#39;m still\n&gt; experimenting\n&gt;   &gt;   with photography and did not clean these\n&gt; images at\n&gt;   &gt;   all.\n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt;   The shishi tsuba is nice. The nanako is very\n&gt; good and\n&gt;   &gt;   interesting in that it changes pattern on the\n&gt; sections\n&gt;   &gt;   with the shi-shi. My hesitation is that the\n&gt; general\n&gt;   &gt;   work is very good but not Goto grade. How else\n&gt; might\n&gt;   &gt;   this one be attributed?\n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt;   The second tsuba is solid shakudo of excellent\n&gt; color\n&gt;   &gt;   and very heavy. The carving is lush and\n&gt; extremely\n&gt;   &gt;   detailed. Despite the thickness of the piece\n&gt; and the\n&gt;   &gt;   carving, everything has a smooth roundedness\n&gt; to it so\n&gt;   &gt;   that there are no obtruding edges.\n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt;   Any help appreciated. I&#39;d like to figure these\n&gt; out as\n&gt;   &gt;   much as possible before I consider whether to\n&gt; submit\n&gt;   &gt;   to shinsa.\n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt;   Thanks,\n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt;   Curran\n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt;  \n&gt; __________________________________________________\n&gt;   &gt;   Do You Yahoo!?\n&gt;   &gt;   Tired of spam?
