I will be seeing Arnold Freznel and\nBarry Hennick on the 13th of December and we&#39;re going to discuss putting\nmaterial online.\n\nThe NTHK through John Prough has offered info as well.\n\nI just put some more money into hosting today to be devoted strictly to\nfree educational nihonto related content. I registered nkb.ca and bought\na new hosting contract for it.\n\nI&#39;m going to move over the data I have now, and hopefully expand the\nofferings.\n\nI put it up as its own domain for a couple reasons, first to put some\nspace between myself and the site, as on my general-purpose site I have\na sword (with more to come soon) and some tsuba for sale, and I would\nlike there to be a clean and clear gap of daylight between the two.\n\nI&#39;m going to write my letter to the Florida Token Kai after I move over\nthe NKB database and files to the new server.\n\n- darcy\n\n&lt;jggilbert@...&gt; writes:\n\n&gt; Darcy,\n&gt; Yes, I understood that you plan to host it for free.  I started pulling JSSUS issues at random to find a mention of the Yumoto tapes.  I don&#39;t see it in any recent issues... the first one that I happened to hit was from July/August of &#39;93.  That lists 11 cassettes of wide-ranging material on history, blades, fittings, kantei, tools, book reviews, etc.  It outlines the contents of each tape.  If it is of any help I can scan it for you.  I hope that the tapes still exist.\n\n&gt; BTW, I happened to see Thomas C. Helm of San Francisco, CA listed among the new members in the September-October &#39;93 issue.  Time flies.\n\n&gt; Jim\n\n\n\n\n&gt;   I&#39;ll do it for free with whatever info I can get my hands on.\n\n&gt;   As long as I don&#39;t go over my current bandwidth limit, I don&#39;t care\n&gt;   how many people leech it off my server and I&#39;m T3 class. \n\n&gt;   I will follow up with Barry Hennick when I see him, and I will ask the\n&gt;   people in the Florida club.\n\n&gt;   - darcy\n\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; nihontostudy-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n\n \n\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
