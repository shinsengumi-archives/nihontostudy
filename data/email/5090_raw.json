(It&#39;s just past midnight on the East coast, but of\ncourse =\r\nit&#39;s already Friday afternoon in Australia and Japan, Friday morning\nin Eur=\r\nope, so to keep it fair let&#39;s say the sale ends midnight 7/7/07\nwherever yo=\r\nu are.) Please do feel free to pass this message on to interested\ncollector=\r\ns who may not be on the several email lists (and excuse the\ncross-posting.)=\r\n\n\nNo minimum purchase - or maximum. This is your chance to get a great deal=\r\n on\nSoshu Den Meisaku Shu, Tanobe&#39;s Meihin Katanaezu Shusei, the complete 6=\r\n\nvolume Kanzan Token Koza, complete 10 volume Haynes Auction Catalogs,\nFuku=\r\nshi&#39;s Goto and Machibori books, or the Kokuh=F4 T=F4ken Zufu.\n\nAll shipping=\r\n will be done at cost as I always have. Postage rates,\nespecially for overs=\r\neas shipments have changed drastically since May 14th,\nbut I will work with=\r\n you to get your order to you safely and quickly with\nthe least expense pos=\r\nsible.\n\nRegrettably, if you live in Illinois, I have to charge 8.75% sales =\r\ntax.\n\nAs always, what is listed on my website is not all of what I have on =\r\nhand,\nthough I will make every effort to keep updating. If there&#39;s somethin=\r\ng\nyou&#39;ve been looking for, please do ask as I very likely may have it.\n\nPay=\r\nment by PayPal, or direct credit card charge to your Visa, MasterCard,\nAmer=\r\nican Express, or Discover Card, and I will accept wire transfers to\naccommo=\r\ndate overseas customers.\n\nFinally, I am aware that the hosting service I us=\r\ne has an expired security\ncertificate, so if you want to use a credit card =\r\nyou can call me, fax me, or\nsplit the information into two or more email me=\r\nssages. Also, there&#39;s a bug\nin the PayPal ordering button - yes, I&#39;m moving=\r\n to a new hosting service and\nworking with a new web person to fix these th=\r\nings. It&#39;s probably best to\nemail me directly in any case as the shipping f=\r\nor each order will be\ndifferent.\n\nThanks in advance for your continued supp=\r\nort!\n\nCraig\n\nCraig L.
