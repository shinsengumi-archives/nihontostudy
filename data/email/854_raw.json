By chance,\nis this person a fencing coach on the West Coast?\n\nI&#39;ve also had similar thoughts about some of rapier\ntsuba being more the smallsword form copies of the\n18th century. I was not sure how far back such\nsmallswords were made and used. From mental trivia, I\nremebered record of one used in a duel c. 1715.\n\nMy knowledge of western sword types is erratic, so I\ndon&#39;t put up much arguement about what was first made\nwhen.\n   Sailors of all types (English, Dutch, Portugese,\nSpanish... southern Spanish and Portugese of mixed\nMoorish ancestry) carried weapons of all types. I\nwondered about cutlasses and other weapons. Shipdeck\nweapons made for hacking with little or no knowledge\nof fencing.\n\nThe study tsuba I have was worn carved face towards\nthe blade, with the cupping toward the hand. Most\ninteresting to me, the INSIDE of the cup was once\nentirely covered in zogan of gold or silver. It is a\nfist sized tsuba, so that was a rather flashy display\nto anyone looking at the samurai who carried it.\n   I did not realize this when I first received it.\nOnly when it was pointed out to me by Jim Gilbert. I\ncan only wonder if it were patterned, and what the\nentire rig must have looked like.\n   Someone quite intentionally dug most of the gold or\nsilver out of the cup, leaving small scars. A shame. \n\nCurran\n\n\n&gt; Curran,\n&gt; I sure won&#39;t promise any &quot;depth&quot; on this issue. I\n&gt; also don&#39;t know which\n&gt; book you have in mind, but I happen to have\n&gt; Yoshimura&#39;s &quot;Namban Tsuba:\n&gt; Akogare No Dezain&quot; with me here. It shows NO cupped\n&gt; guards at all... which\n&gt; merely means they don&#39;t fit his classification.\n&gt; I suppose that cupped guards could be reflective of\n&gt; European designs, but\n&gt; it seems to be no more than a very general\n&gt; reference. Furthermore, I have\n&gt; become convince by John Lissenden that most Namban\n&gt; &quot;rapier&quot; guards date to\n&gt; the 18th century. In John&#39;s view the classic\n&gt; &quot;rapier&quot; tsuba appear to be\n&gt; copies not of rapiers but of the later smallsword\n&gt; form  -  which is a\n&gt; development of the 18th century. Cuphilt rapiers, on\n&gt; the other hand, are\n&gt; (supposedly!) Spanish and 17th century. Given how\n&gt; things were in Japan at\n&gt; that time, I wonder how common they could have been\n&gt; in Japan. Maybe, of\n&gt; course, that could explain how the samurai could\n&gt; have got the cup pointing\n&gt; in the wrong direction!\n&gt; Peter\n&gt; \n&gt; _\n&gt; \n_____________________________________________________\n\n&gt; There is a Namban tsuba book out there. Paperback.\n&gt; We\n&gt; requested Bob Orssman look for it, but he could not\n&gt; find it. It is supposedly a $25 book, and not very\n&gt; old.\n&gt; \n&gt; I do not recall much in the way of cupped guards.\n&gt;   Could you please give your opinion against the\n&gt; cupped guards being not attributed to westerd style?\n&gt; I&#39;ve heard 2 arguments against it, but not in much\n&gt; depth.\n\n&gt; The one I recently picked up is more of a bowl shape\n&gt; (more of an L edge to it, but about 1 cm deep), and\n&gt; would have been worn correctly cupped towards the\n&gt; hand.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nThe New Yahoo!
