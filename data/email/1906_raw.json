Don=B4t get cheeted.\n\n\n  At present you can find a K=\r\niyosada japanese Sword with NBTHK papers \n  for sale on ebay. I bought this=\r\n sword the 21th. of february 2004, \n  payed it but never received it. By re=\r\nquest I received several other \n  photos of the sword and the NBTHK papers =\r\nas well as copies from his \n  passport and driverslicense. This information=\r\n is avaible for the \n  list if you don=B4t find it inconvenient. Look well =\r\nat this sword on \n  ebay and take care of wolflady 137 and jnetweb as well =\r\nas John \n  Pivec, Minneapolis, USA. This sword will without any doubt be pu=\r\nt \n  for sale again. If anyone has this sword in their possession, please \n=\r\n  let me know. I will award informations which will place the sword at \n  m=\r\ny house with 1000 U.S.dollars. If the Nihonto study group find it \n  approp=\r\niate I will put photos of the sword as well as John Pivecs \n  passport and =\r\ndriverslicense, on the list. \n  The Danish Criminal Police, The Danish Fore=\r\nign Ministry and the USA \n  Police are involved in the investigation and I =\r\nhave asked ebay to \n  help with information as well.\n  Thankyou for your he=\r\nlp in advance\n  All the best\n  Allan\n\n\n        Yahoo!
