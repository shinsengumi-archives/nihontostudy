Not too long ago, I came across a reprint of a tsuba book\n&gt; written in 1736.  I can even supply a picture, because I put photos\nwhenever\n&gt; possible of Japanese language titles into my bibliography, which I need to\n&gt; avoid duplicate acquisitions.  Koshoyama found me a copy.\n&gt;\n&gt; Kanzan, Matsumiya. Tsuba shokan koketsu, 7.5&quot; x 10.5&quot;, 210 pages.\nEstimated\n&gt; to be authored in 1736, &quot;Tsuba shokan koketsu&quot; is said to be the oldest\n&gt; monograph on the appreciation of the tsuba. The hand-written original has\n&gt; long been lost, but over the years numerous hand-copies were made among\n&gt; tsuba and sword enthusiasts. Since the extant copies were becoming scarce\n&gt; and out of reach of average tsuba enthusiasts, Shibata Mitsuo undertook\nthe\n&gt; project of publishing the book in a modern format in 1967. This book is\nthe\n&gt; result of that effort. Original text and illustrations (taken from several\n&gt; reliable copies in existence) are duplicated in large pages, and modern\n&gt; typesetting was added to enable today&#39;s audience to read the cursive\n&gt; classical writing. The direct translation of the title is &quot;Orally\n&gt; transmitted secret of the appreciation of the tsuba,&quot; but &quot;How to\nAppreciate\n&gt; the Tsuba&quot; would be much more appropriate for the content.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt; From: &quot;arnold frenzel&quot; &lt;afrenzel@...&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;jdz@...&gt;; &lt;token_kenkyu_kai@...&gt;;\n&gt; &lt;nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Monday, March 21, 2005 9:29 AM\n&gt; Subject: Re: [nihontostudy] papering tsuba\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hi:\n&gt; &gt;  That is any excellent set of questions. It is useful to remember that\n&gt; &gt; while sword knowledge and what should be designated as what goes back at\n&gt; &gt; least to the time of the first Ashikaga Shogun, knowledge of tosogu,\n&gt; &gt; particularly iron tsuba, goes back no early than the late Bakumatsu era,\n&gt; &gt; particularly with the writings of Akiyama and\n&gt; &gt; Kawaguchi. The knowledge paradigm is a still expanding one and the\n&gt; &gt; boundaries are somewhat indistinct and evolving. There can be a great\n&gt; &gt; deal of controversy as to what group something falls into and wildly\n&gt; &gt; different opinions as to age of manufacture, that of course hinging on\n&gt; &gt; the date of the adoption and substantial spread of the use of\n&gt; &gt; uchi-gatana. All one needs to do is to watch the moving time line in the\n&gt; &gt; writings of the late Sasano Masayuki.\n&gt; &gt;  My advice would be to be conservative in what you submit unless it is a\n&gt; &gt; piece about which you have a great deal of curiosity and it being of\n&gt; &gt; good workmanship, preservation and aesthetic content. On the other hand\n&gt; &gt; one can not sell short the impact that papers have on the value of\n&gt; &gt; fittings and the certainty with which they can be sold at a predictable\n&gt; &gt; price, if that is of relevance to you.\n&gt; &gt;  Arnold\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; jdz@... 03/20/05 3:17 PM &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve never submitted anything for papers, and just to experience the\n&gt; &gt; process I was thinking of submitting one or two tsuba to shinsa.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; But looking at the costs, and not believing I own any more than\n&gt; &gt; Hozon-level sorts of tsuba, I began to wonder if it made sense to spend\n&gt; &gt; several hundred dollars just to add minimum Hozon papers, or perhaps to\n&gt; &gt; fail.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Any wisdom out there on how good a tsuba needs to be to be Hozon or\n&gt; &gt; Tokubetsu Hozon?  Why paper a tsuba at all?  What makes you decide to\n&gt; &gt; submit a particular one?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; DZ\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
