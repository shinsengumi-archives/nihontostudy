It w=\r\nas its serial and disjointed format that made it awkward to use, but its co=\r\nmprehensiveness more than made up for that. Also, the late Robert M. Lewert=\r\n put out a quite complete and reasonably accurate index of the NL in its or=\r\niginal form, so if one had that it was never a probelm to access. Thanks fo=\r\nr the additional information Jim. \n AF \n\n\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; jggilbert@... 08/0=\r\n5/05 7:02 PM &gt;&gt;&gt;\nTo clarify for those who haven&#39;t seen it, this is more tha=\r\nn just a reprint of Albert Yamanaka&#39;s original work.  Paul Allman took apar=\r\nt a set of the original newsletters and rearranged them according to a logi=\r\ncal table of contents.  The first two volumes are as easily accessed as the=\r\n Nihonto Koza or similar encyclopedia.  \n\nVolume I covers Koto, arranged by=\r\n the classical road system.\n\nVolume II is Shinto and Shin-Shinto, followed =\r\nby History of the Japanese Sword, Identification of Nihonto through Shape, =\r\nand Definition of Nihonto and its Nomenclature.\n\nVolume III includes Histor=\r\nical figures, Famous Swords in Japanese History, Kokuho, Missing Kokuho and=\r\n Juyo Bijutsu and Kyoho Meibutsu Cho\n\nVolume IV continues Kyoho Meibutsu Ch=\r\no, several articles by others, the Tokugawa Jikki and an extensive compilat=\r\nion of Random Thoughts.\n\nSome of the most interesting material is in later =\r\ntwo volumes, but an index would greatly enhance their usability.\n\nThe Allma=\r\nn version came out over ten years ago, but was &quot;off the market&quot; until recen=\r\ntly.  I see that latest offering does not include binding of the four volum=\r\nes, so be sure to get them into some sort of binding before the pages get m=\r\nixed up. \n\nJim\n\n\n  Everyone can latch on to one, because the NCJSC reprinte=\r\nd it.\n\n  http://www.ncjsc.org/NCJSC_Publications_4_04.pdf\n\n\n    Hi:\n    The=\r\n Yamanaka Newsletter is second to none as a useful source of comprehensive =\r\nand detailed information on the Japanese sword - coming as a newsletter it =\r\nhas certain natural limitations of easy use, ie, it isn&#39;t easy to use, but =\r\nit is virtually without peer.\n    If you can latch onto one, do!\n    AF\n\n  =\r\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; jdz@... 08/04/05 11:21 AM &gt;&gt;&gt;\n    I would strongly recommend addi=\r\ntionally:\n\n   Albert &quot;Kozan&quot; Yamanaka, reformatted by Paul R.
