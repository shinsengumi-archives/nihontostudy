It was in 1992 when my wife began her one year struggle with cancer. At her last sword show--probably in Houston I guess--Ken, who was also struggling and somehow surviving his cancer, had a wonderful &quot;pep-talk&quot; with Kathy that truly helped her to continue her treatments. It amazes me to realize Ken survived another eleven years. He shall be missed!\n\nRon\nSTL\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: tom helm \n  To: tom helm \n  Sent: Sunday, August 10, 2003 8:35 PM\n  Subject: [nihontostudy] Ken Mack\n\n\n  Some of you may have known Ken Mack from sword collecting, restoration, or\n  in martial arts.\n\n  I heard today he has passed away.\n\n  May we keep him and his family in our prayers.\n\n  Sam C.\n\n  This was posted to another list.
