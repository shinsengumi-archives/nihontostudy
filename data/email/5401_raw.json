Today is a black day indeed as we lost our dear friend, Ralph Bell.  The world is a sadder place today.\n\n\nI just received a phone call from his wife, Theresa, and she told me that yesterday afternoon while he was returning from fishing, he lost control of his truck and was thrown to his death.  I really do not have any further details as the exact cause of death will not be forthcoming until after an autopsy is done tomorrow.\n\n\nThe most important thing we can do for the family at this time is NOT call Theresa.  She is dealing with this tragedy with the family and does not need to go over the story multiple times.  She has requested that all calls go through me.  My home number is 650-595-1703.  I will follow up with further emails as more information is forthcoming.\n\n\nThe full ramifications of this event has not sunk in yet and I am sure it will take awhile for each of you to believe it also.\n\n\nPlease contact any collectors who knew Ralph and pass the word along.\n\n\nFor those of you who would like to send a card to Ralph&#39;s family here is his address:\n\n\nTheresa Bell\n650 Calle de la Plata\nSparks, NV 89436\n\n\n\n\nTake care and say a prayer for the family tonight.\n\n\nFred\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n************************\nFred Weissberg\nNihonto.com\n************************\n\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
