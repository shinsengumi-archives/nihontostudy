So how much sori is too \n  much?? \n\n  I mean it is quite pleasing to the eye, very appealing in fact but it sorta \n  looks like a caricature of a sword. \n\n  The sori is tori-sori nice and even the length of the blade, so in keeping \n  with that I went ahead and curved the nakago to match the sori in the blade \n  to stay with the &quot;lines&quot; of the sword...\n\n  It is in mid polish right now and once I get it mounted I will post some \n  pics... I am amazed that the thing held together in the quench as it was \n  moaning and groaning and dancing around while it was in the tank but I didn&#39;t \n  hear one &quot;Tink&quot; or &quot;Toink&quot; and no cracks are coming up and I am at 800 \n  grit on the polish (I don&#39;t use stones..I am doing this for book IV and am \n  using available abrasives that just about anyone can get...and I must say I am \n  getting some really nice results on the blades I am making...)\n\n  So did I make an abomination with 1 1 /2&quot; of sori??? This should cut really \n  well with that much curve but I dunno...\n\n  Thanks all!!\n\n  JPH\n\n\n  Dr JP Hrisoulas, COL NANG (Ret)\n  Bladesmith.\n  Author: The Complete Bladesmith\n  The Master Bladesmith\n  The Pattern Welded Blade\n  http: _www.atar.com_ (http://www.atar.com/) \n\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n  \n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
