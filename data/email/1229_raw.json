They&#39;re accomplices to the sale. Every fake sold \nmeans\n&gt; money in Ebay&#39;s pocket. If you turn on the lights while the thief \nand\n&gt; his accomplice are robbing your house, the accomplice suddenly \nturns\n&gt; into a vigilante and is glad to help you catch the thief... \n&gt; \n&gt; That&#39;s the one and only reason Ebay doesn&#39;t do anything about it.\n&gt; \n&gt; On the flip side of the coin...\n&gt; \n&gt; There is a saying, &quot;It&#39;s impossible to cheat an honest man.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Everyone on Ebay wants to get a steal. They want to buy your item \nfor\n&gt; less than it is worth, and if you ask a fair price few will go to\n&gt; you. They will flock to those that appear to be offering discounted\n&gt; items though, often times cutting deals outside of ebay, and all \nthey do\n&gt; is screw themselves. Their own greed means they end up with these\n&gt; valueless pieces of junk. \n&gt; \n&gt; Even armed with a little information, if they see someone who \ndoesn&#39;t\n&gt; appear to know what they&#39;re selling, how many of them send an \nemail and\n&gt; say, &quot;Hey dude, that junky violin you found in your grandpa&#39;s \nattic is\n&gt; really a Stradivarius. You should get it authenticated and sell it \nat\n&gt; Sotheby&#39;s, pay off your mortgage and be able to send your kid to a \ngood\n&gt; university.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Very few.\n&gt; \n&gt; So when you go out of your way to inform them, often times you \ntake away\n&gt; the mystery and the treasure hunting mentality takes them\n&gt; elsewhere. Right into the hands of the scammers.\n&gt; \n&gt; They want to buy something from you of extreme value, and not pay \nfor\n&gt; it. So they find someone who looks like they&#39;re providing this to \nthem. \n&gt; \n&gt; It&#39;s not only with swords, but it&#39;s with diamonds... other \ngemstones,\n&gt; watches, everything. I sold some gold coins once, and I had no end \nof\n&gt; people offering to do me a favor and give me 20% *less* than the \nmarket\n&gt; price of gold if I would sell to them now and end the auction.\n&gt; \n&gt; Gold is the one thing that has a well understood value in the \nworld, and\n&gt; even on ebay auctions will end at the market price of gold\n&gt; consistently. The price of gold is less a reflection on the value \nof\n&gt; gold then it is on the value of paper money. \n&gt; \n&gt; These people were effectively offering me 80 cents if I would give \nthem\n&gt; a dollar bill. There is no mentality there for a fair deal, just a \nhope\n&gt; that they can get something for less than it is valued.\n&gt; \n&gt; For both reasons above, junk will continue to be put on ebay and \nthe\n&gt; auctions will be well attended. People will buy first and ask \nquestions\n&gt; later. And ebay will turn a blind eye to everything.\n&gt; \n&gt; - darcy\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;saemonjonosuke@h...&gt; writes:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Hi,\n&gt; &gt; It is getting more &#39;funny&#39; with this Chinese &#39;dealers&#39; on Ebay.\n&gt; &gt; 2 weeks ago I put a tsuba from Mastsugu on Ebay,, many people \nwatch \n&gt; &gt; and bid on it.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; But now,,, some Chinese dealer copy my title and discription and \nput \n&gt; &gt; it on his 3 *^#@ tsuba&#39;s......\n&gt; &gt; Please see these items.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Item number: 2578865338 / 2578866848 / 2578869530 \n&gt;  \n&gt; &gt; I don&#39;t understand that Ebay doesn&#39;t do anything about this.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; John\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; &gt; nihontostudy-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Your use of Yahoo!
