I purchased the new, 2-vol. set of Sue-\nKoto. I can allready tell it&#39;s going to be very educational. I went \nto all the lectures - the Kodogu & Tsuba lectures (by Gilbert & \nRobson) were the best. Benson lectured on Bizen swords and I was able \nto admire and study 5 of them. \n\nThis is my second time to attend this show. I decided to have my own \ntable and actually sold some of the wonderful Tsuba that I own (I own \ntoo many!). I was very glad to meet Robert Haynes. He is so happy to \nanswer any and all questions that anyone ask&#39;s. I ask him plenty and \nwas educated in the process. \n\nThe only head-ache occured coming and going at the SF airport. I had \na Security Weapon case to carry 2 swords - allmost lost, repeatedly \nsearched, I could go on and on. \n\nI have a question..........What is the web-site address for the NTHK? \nI am contemplating joining. I hear they have a good &#39;novice&#39; course \nabout Nihonto.\n\nThanks,\nElliott\n\n \n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
