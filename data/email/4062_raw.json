The second might also be Owari kinko of the type called &#39;Kozenji&#39;, I am not sure what this means as it seems to be a catchall term, is the plate nanako struck over the gold lightning pattern? Perhaps Jim could help on these.\nAlan\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: Curran Campbell \n  To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Thursday, March 30, 2006 3:43 AM\n  Subject: [nihontostudy] 2 new Tsuba to ask about / Kantei\n\n\n  List,\n\n  I have 2 tsuba that I would like opinions about.\n\n  Tsuba #1:    Shishi\n\n  http://ph.groups.yahoo.com/group/nihontostudy/photos/view/ff0b?b=8\n\n  Tsuba #2:   Unknown\n\n  http://ph.groups.yahoo.com/group/nihontostudy/photos/view/ff0b?b=9\n  _____________________________________________________\n\n  Both photos are in my YahooGroups folder. Please\n  ignore the spots of high red. I&#39;m still experimenting\n  with photography and did not clean these images at\n  all.\n\n  The shishi tsuba is nice. The nanako is very good and\n  interesting in that it changes pattern on the sections\n  with the shi-shi. My hesitation is that the general\n  work is very good but not Goto grade. How else might\n  this one be attributed?\n\n  The second tsuba is solid shakudo of excellent color\n  and very heavy. The carving is lush and extremely\n  detailed. Despite the thickness of the piece and the\n  carving, everything has a smooth roundedness to it so\n  that there are no obtruding edges.\n\n  Any help appreciated. I&#39;d like to figure these out as\n  much as possible before I consider whether to submit\n  to shinsa.\n\n  Thanks,\n\n  Curran\n\n\n\n  __________________________________________________\n  Do You Yahoo!?\n  Tired of spam?
