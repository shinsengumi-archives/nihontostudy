The boshi of this tanto shows (as described), &quot;...the boshi is \n&gt; sugu then turns back in ko-maru with hakikake then nie-no-kui-sagari \n&gt; (descending nie line)...) Personally, I&#39;ve never noticed this odd \n&gt; characteristic on any illustrated swords before although it seems \n&gt; &quot;somebody&quot; recently asked me about this kind of thing.\n&gt;\n&gt; For those of you who do not have this journal, picture the boshi as \n&gt; described and at the end of the rather extended kaeri, there is a short \n&gt; &quot;wisp&quot; of nie that comes down off the end of the kaeri at about a 45 \n&gt; degree angle, into the ji. Interesting odd nie formation! Can anyone \n&gt; elaborate on this characteristic, if it is unique to Yoshimitsu or \n&gt; perhaps Awataguchi blades in general, whatever???
