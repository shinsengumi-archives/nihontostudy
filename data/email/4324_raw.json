Again, it seems to have some &quot;age&quot; and the style of decoration (inlay) seems so unlike Heianjo/Kyoto -- to my eye -- and the lack of kozuka/kogai-ana and the kiku shape...while not a super tsuba or anything, I do find it rather interesting to try and understand. \n\nRon\nSTL\n\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: Alan Bale \n  To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Thursday, July 06, 2006 5:17 AM\n  Subject: Re: [nihontostudy] Tsuba...kantei?\n\n\n  Hi Ron Rich,\n  I don&#39;t know why I said Ko-Shoami, it was just a feeling about the decoration. Many years ago I has a Heianjo style brass inlay tsuba signed and dated in the 1560s I think, an unrecorded maker in the provinces, without the signature it would be called Heianjo without a doubt although it had an irregularly punched plate.\n  Alan\n\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: Richard Turner \n  To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Wednesday, July 05, 2006 11:06 PM\n  Subject: Re: [nihontostudy] Tsuba...kantei?\n\n  Hi Ron, interesting, Alan may be right, but I have a Heianjo guard that \n  is dated to late Momoyama or early Edo ( guessing Edo ) that has similar \n  looking iron, the flows are also similar and the scattered leaves are \n  also Heinajo esk. The scollaped mimi is interesting, I have a couple of \n  these in my Heianjo book from memory.

It is iron with brass\n  &gt; &gt; inlay, kiku design, measures 86 x 84 x 4 mm in size. Inlay represents\n  &gt; &gt; mostly leaves with a few flowers. The inlaywork overlaps onto the edge\n  &gt; &gt; of the tsuba. Inlay is about 90% intact on face, 50% intact on\n  &gt; &gt; backside. Notice there are no hitsu-ana present.\n  &gt; &gt;\n  &gt; &gt; http://tinyurl.com/mhf6d &lt;http://tinyurl.com/mhf6d&gt; \n  &gt; &lt;http://tinyurl.com/mhf6d &lt;http://tinyurl.com/mhf6d&gt;&gt;\n  &gt; &gt;\n  &gt; &gt; This tsuba seems too elaborately inlaid to be called Kyo-zogan and I&#39;m\n  &gt; &gt; curious if perhaps it might fall more into Yoshiro work.
