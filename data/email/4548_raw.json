Haynes\n&gt; \n&gt; Soten Tsuba\n&gt; The first Sot=\r\nen lived in Kyoto in his early life.  Later, he moved \nto \n&gt; Hikone in Omi =\r\nProvince and worked there about the Kyoho era (1716-\n&gt; 36).  He received ma=\r\nny orders from Kyoto and was obliged to travel \n&gt; back and forth between th=\r\ne two cities.  No matter which city he \n&gt; worked in, he would sign as a res=\r\nident of Hikone.\n&gt; \n&gt; The first Soten had many students who helped him prod=\r\nuce Soten \nstyle \n&gt; tsuba.  In fact, during his lifetime, the demand for hi=\r\ns style of \n&gt; tsuba became so great that he and his school could not keep u=\r\np \nwith \n&gt; the orders.  In Kyoto, the Hiragiya school and, in Aizu, the \nSh=\r\noami \n&gt; school, made Soten style tsuba to help fill the orders for the \nman=\r\ny \n&gt; requests received from all parts of the country.\n&gt; \n&gt; There are severa=\r\nl opinions concerning the number of generations of \n&gt; the main line Soten m=\r\nasters.  Some say there were two, or that \nthere \n&gt; were three, or even mor=\r\ne.  The most logical is two.\n&gt; \n&gt; The first Soten signed his early work Shu=\r\nten.  The second \ngeneration \n&gt; used only the name Soten.  In addition to t=\r\nhese two artists there \nare \n&gt; at least twenty-five well-known students who=\r\n signed their work \nwith \n&gt; their own names, and innumerrable students who =\r\nsigned with the \nname \n&gt; Soten, or did not sign their work at all.  A stude=\r\nnt of note is \n&gt; Soshu, an above average worker, but the most famous studen=\r\nt is \nNomura \n&gt; Kanenori:  his best work is about equal to that of the seon=\r\nd Soten.\n&gt; \n&gt; There are slight differeces between the signatures of the fir=\r\nst \nand \n&gt; second Soten.  The first signed with kanji of about average size=\r\n.  \n&gt; The second used kanji slightly smaller than the size of the \nfirst.  =\r\n\n&gt; There are other differences in their work, such as the designs of \nthe \n=\r\n&gt; second being more picturesque and detailed.  The surface of his \nplate \n&gt;=\r\n is very busy and brilliant; the design covering the major portion \nof \n&gt; t=\r\nhe web area.  The first also used small figures in the designs \nbut \n&gt; he d=\r\nid not cover as much of the web area with his decoration.  He \ndid \n&gt; not u=\r\nse as much inlay of gold and silver.  From the style of \ncarving \n&gt; used ma=\r\ninly by the second Soten this school has come to be called \n&gt; Hikonebori sc=\r\nhool.\n&gt; \n&gt; Shape:  round/oval\n&gt; Plate Metal:  the first used iron plate.  T=\r\nhe second used iron, \nand \n&gt; in some cases shakudo plate.\n&gt; Carving:  human=\r\n figures, landscapes, flowers and birds, historical \n&gt; subjects of either C=\r\nhinese of Japanese derivation.  The inlay is \n&gt; usually gold, copper, silve=\r\nr, and shakudo.  Human faces will be \n&gt; either silver or copper inlay.  Bot=\r\nh masters used pure silver for \n&gt; their inlay.\n&gt; Signiture:  Goshu Hikone n=\r\no Ju Shoheishi Niudo Soten Sei.  He also \n&gt; signed with a very long signitu=\r\nre:  Goshu Hikone Nakayabu no Ju \n&gt; Soheishi Niudo Kitagawa Soten Sei.\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n Summary:\n&gt; The first and second Soten were splendid at their chosen style.=\r\n  \nThe \n&gt; iron is of good quality but the tempering is quite common.  The \n=\r\n&gt; nikubori is inferior.  He tried to cover this fault in the iron \n&gt; qualit=\r\ny by making a good edge and using fine decoration.  Although \n&gt; their work =\r\nis usually on iron plate, the plate is subordinate to \nthe \n&gt; decoration.  =\r\nTheir work should be judged on the quality of the \n&gt; carving, inlay and des=\r\nigns.\n&gt; \n&gt; Later Soten Tsuba:\n&gt; The majority of the work in the style of th=\r\nis school is but poor \n&gt; imitation made by shiiremono makers in the late Ed=\r\no age at the \ndocks \n&gt; of Yokohama.  These imitations account for more than=\r\n ninety-five \n&gt; percent of all Soten tsuba extant.  Even the best work of t=\r\nhe \n&gt; students, though not common, is usually only slightly better than \nth=\r\ne \n&gt; shiiremono examples.  The work of this school was so corrupted \nthat a=\r\n \n&gt; true idea of the real Soten tsuba is almost impossible to obtain.  \nIt =\r\n\n&gt; is unfortunate that the best work of this school has come under \nthe \n&gt; =\r\nsame pale of suspicion that surrounds the common work of the \n&gt; immitators.=\r\n  Had the work of this school been less papular, the \ntrue \n&gt; work of the f=\r\nirst and second Soten might be regarded with more \n&gt; respect than it now re=\r\nceives.\n&gt; authors note:  the term Hikonebori means the original style of \n&gt;=\r\n carving of the Soten school.  It is a combination of low relief, \nline \n&gt; =\r\ncarving, some shishiai, detailed iroye inlay and elaborate \nopenwork.  \n&gt; I=\r\nn reality it is but one type of ubu-zukashi, and is found rarely \nin \n&gt; the=\r\n early work of the first and second Soten.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n"
