Fun socially for me, but sold next to nothing therefore, but next to nothing.\n\nWill check the kogai for you but I do not think there is anything in Mino-bori. Did you ever get my response to you on the 2009 KTK book? Never heard back from you on that. Are you back in Japan? If so, lucky you!!\n\nRon\nSTL\n\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: excelsiorilluminati \n  To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Monday, May 03, 2010 8:37 AM\n  Subject: [nihontostudy] Re: Chicago chit-chat anyone?\n\n\n    \n  Hi Ron, I remember a couple of years ago in Japan you mentioned you had a plethora of kogai and would perhaps be pruning your collection. Do you by any chance have a Mino-bori kogai that is cluttering up the drawer? Anyone else? Of good good to very good quality. It is true that once this site and others had a lot of traffic. Learned a lot over time here.
