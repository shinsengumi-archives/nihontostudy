He supports this with ubu-ana in early\ntsuba. Of course, you have to accept that his dating of undated,\nundocumented tsuba are as early as Heian and Kamakura periods. It has\nrecently become fashionable to make all of Sasano&#39;s dates much later\n(younger?). I also have serious doubts about kogai being used for marking or\ncarrying heads. I don&#39;t think they would stand up to that kind of abuse.\nPicking ears and combing hair, certainly. Nonetheless, there certainly are\ntsuba, and tsuba that are clearly early -- Nambokucho to be conservative --\nthat have ubu kozuka ana as well as ubu kogai ana. \n\nGordon\n----------\nFrom: tom helm &lt;junkmail@...&gt;\nTo: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: Re: [nihontostudy] kogai on katana\nDate: Sun, 4 May 2003 10:43:39 -0700\n\n\n&gt;Hey guys,\n&gt;\n&gt;I was just curious - Anybody have any idea why momoyama era katana\n&gt;sometimes got only a kogai?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n      I don&#39;t KNOW but I am always full of theories...\nThink of the uses for these two, a kogai was used to dress the hair \nfrom way back, there is also evidence it was used to carry captured \nheads. Practical battlefield applications.\n      The kind of cutting done in battle was too rough for a small \nknife and was certainly work more suited for a tanto or wakizashi. \nOnce you enter the Edo period, there were many more uses for a \n&quot;pocket knife&quot; EG; cutting paper to leave a small note somewhere, \ntrimming a frayed edge, opening a bundle...\n      Todays trivia question; what does Michelle Yeoh pull from her \nhair to hand Zhang Zyi to use as a &quot;pass&quot; into the Wudan warehouse in \nthe final scene of Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon?\n-t\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\nYahoo!
