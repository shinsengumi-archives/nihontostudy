They were always worn on the  left side, the Japan sort of \nfrowned on left handedness (I hope that is a real word).  Anyway, the \ndaisho pair would not be worn on the right side of your body.\n\nBob\n\nPeter Farrar wrote:\n\n&gt;Does anyone have a katana saya with a groove that they can post a \n&gt;picture of to group?
