I had seen the blade before it was polished and also \nOKe=\r\nd it for Yushu-saku. It is a very fine piece and I hope I can figure \nout a=\r\n way to put the money together. The Sano trip was, as always, a \nreal pleas=\r\nure. Watanabe sensei got me to do some translation work for \nher, and she p=\r\nut out some very fine pieces. I particularly like the \nChu-Aoe blade. If yo=\r\nu remember Okada san&#39;s Yosazaemon Sukesada katana \nwe brought over last yea=\r\nr, the Aoe blade looked just like it -- only \nbetter. It was pretty clear s=\r\neeing that blade that Yosazaemon was \ncopying the Chu-Aoe style of workmans=\r\nhip down to the shape of the \nblade. Anyway, there will always be a next ti=\r\nme.\n\nGordon\n\nOn =C3=AC=CB=99=C3=B3j=C3=AC=CB=99, 11 21, 2004, at 10:47  PM,=\r\n arnold frenzel wrote:\n\n&gt; Hi Gordon:\n&gt; It is &lt;stevey@...&gt;.
