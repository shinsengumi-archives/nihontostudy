I do remember this now that you mentioned it. What started\nall this was my trying to &quot;date&quot; the gold dai-sho menuki I mentioned. When I\nsee &quot;gold&quot; I tend to think &quot;late Edo&quot; but that&#39;s not always true. The set I\nbought from Fred, being a dai-sho and of gold still makes me think late Edo;\nif a single set (not made as a dai-sho) then I probably should be thinking\n&quot;maybe earlier.&quot; Oh such fun with these toys, eh? \n\nRon\n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: ROBSON Gordon \nTo: nihontostudy@ &lt;mailto:nihontostudy%40yahoogroups.com&gt; yahoogroups.com \nSent: Wednesday, February 27, 2008 3:23 PM\nSubject: Re: [nihontostudy] Kyo-kinko\n\nHi Ron,\n\nMy understanding is that Kyo-Kinko is the new name for Waki-Goto. This would\n\nmake them a grab bag like Ko-Kinko or even Shoami. Their dates are post-Ko-\nKinko, so early Edo to Bakumatsu. There is a Kyo-Kinko book out there. I\nthink the \ntitle is Kyo-Kinko no Kenkyu (research into Kyo-Kinko) or something like\nthat. Jim \nis probably better up on this stuff then I am.\n\nOn on different note, good luck to Harry.
