There are several makers listed\n&gt; with that name.\n\nSupposing this is not gimei for some reason, I guess the kao would help\ntell them apart? There is an overall feeling of newness to this as well,\nso I would think that the maker would be working in the 1800s. \n\n&gt; The second is Nara Toshi (Naga?) followed by a kao.  I&#39;m not seeing\n&gt; the second character on the left very well, but if you&#39;re seeing it as\n&gt; the other &quot;toshi,&quot; that kanji can also be read Naga and there are a\n&gt; number of makers signing that way including the Nara Toshinaga of\n&gt; sansaku fame.\n\nRobertson character 187 is the one, most definitely and beyond a doubt\nin person. I couldn&#39;t get it to stand out very well on the scan, I&#39;ve\nbeen sorting out various things since coming back from Japan so I didn&#39;t\nput a lot of effort into getting a good clear one.\n\nReading it as naga is news to me though, thanks for the tip, I will do\nsome digging. I don&#39;t have much in the way of documentation for kodogu,\nbut I saw something for a Toshinaga, none for Hiroyuki though.\n\nThanks very much!\n\n- darcy\n\n\n"
