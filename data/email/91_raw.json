I have an old friend staying with me and haven&#39;t had much time to devote to the list.\n\nThe only koshirae mounted with Ko Katchushi or Ko Tosho tsuba that I have seen in person or in illustrations were typical mid to late Muromachi katana or wakizashi.  I have not seen an early tachi mounted with these guards.\n\nMost of the early tachi koshirae that have been preserved seem to have been for formal wear and these are fitted with relatively elaborate soft metal guards.  There are many practical tachi preserved at Oyamazumi, and some others in existence elsewhere, and they are mounted with nerikawa tsuba.  It seems that early tosho and katchushi guards were intended for practical use, but it is not clear to me that they were ever mounted on tachi despite some references claiming this.  I&#39;ll try to get back to the possible use of some of these tsuba on naginata or nagimaki, but I don&#39;t think that the majority were mounted on pole arms.\n\nReading ahead through the email list, Gordon is of course correct about Sasano&#39;s interpretation of the picture scrolls and his construction of a chronological sequence from extant iron guards.  I don&#39;t think that any of these very early katana or koshirae still exist.  I have to wonder why the tsuba still exist and why so many of the supposed early examples have wakizashi-style kozuka ana that are considered to have been added later.\n\nIt&#39;s late and I&#39;m out of steam again...  more to follow when time permits.\nJim\n\n\n  Jim-\n   .......\n        I am curious about your thoughts on the use of and changes in \n  the tsuba. Early kenukigata tachi and ito maki tachi have thick soft \n  metal or kawa tsuba, many of these are seen in the catalogs. What \n  mounts do we see the big perfectly circular Kokatchushi and Kotosho \n  tsuba on? In your minds eye what king of mount do you see these on?I \n  could see these large rather thin plates being useful say on \n  horseback, when blade to blade combat would have occurred less often. \n  But as Richard says once we move from tachi to katana, don&#39;t the \n  tsuba have smaller diameters and become a bit thicker? what is the \n  progression as you see it?\n        Kyo-sukashi ostensibly was the rage in the capitol, where \n  artistic merit surely held sway, these pieces made for the elite may \n  have seen battle but were seen as worthy of preservation early on. I \n  am thinking the workingmans&#39; sword guard would be more along the \n  lines of a Hoan, very simple iron and were used up or even tossed out \n  in favor of the latest fad.\n  -t\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
