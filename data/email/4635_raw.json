My first thought was also the possibility=\r\n of\na well preserved nakago.  As far as determining if it is ubu or\no-suria=\r\nge unfortunately exceeds my expertise.  I&#39;ve taken a few photos\nand will po=\r\nst them as soon as possible.  I was unable to capture all\naspects of my des=\r\ncription in the pictures, but hopefully they will help.\nThe sori is 1.5 cm =\r\nand is tori.  The blade as mentioned is a bit &quot;\nrough&quot; but is overall healt=\r\nhy.  I  detect no &quot;drop off &quot; running my\nthumb and fore finger through the =\r\nmachi area.  Possibly another clue to\na later blade??\n\nThanks again,\n\nDave\n=\r\n--- In nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Ron Hartmann&quot; &lt;swords@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n Ricky -\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;The hada is very prominant, it seems to be a Itame/Mokume mix=\r\n with\nMasame near the ha.

It has a Shin gunto tsuka and a\n&gt; &gt; older\n&gt; &gt; &gt; appearing Kyo-sukashi ts=\r\nuba. The blade is a bit &quot;rough&quot; but still\n&gt; &gt; has\n&gt; &gt; &gt; very visible hada. =\r\nThe hamon appears to be Suguha for the most\n&gt; &gt; part.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The hada is ver=\r\ny prominant, it seems to be a Itame/Mokume mix with\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Masame near the h=\r\na. The Masame hada also can be clearly seen\n&gt; &gt; through\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the kissaki. =\r\nThe sword is unsigned with a osujikai yasurime. The\n&gt; &gt; &gt; nakago condition =\r\nappears ( a guess ) approx. 1800-1860. I&#39;m\n&gt; &gt; thinking\n&gt; &gt; &gt; a late Edo co=\r\npy of an Koto Yamato. Nagasa 65cm, machi width 3.1\n&gt; &gt; cm,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; yokote 2.1=\r\n cm, sori 1.5 cm. Do these characteristics suggest to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; anyone a partic=\r\nular Shinshinto School, Smith or Province. I know\n&gt; &gt; it\n&gt; &gt; &gt; would be dif=\r\nficult with or without blade in hand, but any advice\n&gt; &gt; or\n&gt; &gt; &gt; informati=\r\non would be appreciated.
