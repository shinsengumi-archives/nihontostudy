For a beginner, his oshigata\nmakes it abs=\r\nolutely clear what you are looking at and what you should be\nlooking for. A=\r\n standard oshigata is also a good thing, but I think it is\nmore appropriate=\r\n for well trained eyes who know what they are looking\nat, and also know fro=\r\nm experience what it would look like if they had\nthat particular sword in h=\r\nand.\n\nAnyway, having Nagayama sensei&#39;s oshigata coming up makes a good onli=\r\nne\nreference for smiths. It sounds like there may be more coming, and if\nso=\r\n, it&#39;s going to become a great quick reference guide.\n\n- darcy\n\n&lt;swords@usr=\r\noute66.net&gt; writes:\n\n&gt; Jim, all - I bet it would be interesting to see oshi=\r\ngata presented\n&gt; side-by-side of the very same sword, using Nagayama&#39;s meth=\r\nod (which\n&gt; apparently illustrates details in a very graphic way) and the\n&gt;=\r\n traditional (realist) method.  One method &quot;draws in&quot; the detail that\n&gt; sho=\r\nuld be noted while the other method gives a very &quot;true&quot;\n&gt; illustration of t=\r\nhe hamon, leaving finding and understanding the\n&gt; subtle &quot;detail&quot; up to the=\r\n viewer...something like that, anyway.\n\n&gt; Ron\n&gt; STL\n&gt;   ----- Original Mess=\r\nage ----- \n&gt;   From: Jim Gilbert \n&gt;   To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n&gt;  =\r\n Sent: Tuesday, July 01, 2003 11:32 PM\n&gt;   Subject: Re: [nihontostudy] A di=\r\nfferent view...\n\n\n&gt;   Tom,\n&gt;   Any idea of how the oshigata are actually dr=\r\nawn?
