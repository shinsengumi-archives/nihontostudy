I will be seeing Arnold Freznel and\n  Barry Hennick on the 13th of December and we&#39;re going to discuss putting\n  material online.\n\n  The NTHK through John Prough has offered info as well.\n\n  I just put some more money into hosting today to be devoted strictly to\n  free educational nihonto related content. I registered nkb.ca and bought\n  a new hosting contract for it.\n\n  I&#39;m going to move over the data I have now, and hopefully expand the\n  offerings.\n\n  I put it up as its own domain for a couple reasons, first to put some\n  space between myself and the site, as on my general-purpose site I have\n  a sword (with more to come soon) and some tsuba for sale, and I would\n  like there to be a clean and clear gap of daylight between the two.\n\n  I&#39;m going to write my letter to the Florida Token Kai after I move over\n  the NKB database and files to the new server.\n\n  - darcy\n\n  &lt;jggilbert@...&gt; writes:\n\n  &gt; Darcy,\n  &gt; Yes, I understood that you plan to host it for free.  I started pulling JSSUS issues at random to find a mention of the Yumoto tapes.  I don&#39;t see it in any recent issues... the first one that I happened to hit was from July/August of &#39;93.  That lists 11 cassettes of wide-ranging material on history, blades, fittings, kantei, tools, book reviews, etc.  It outlines the contents of each tape.  If it is of any help I can scan it for you.  I hope that the tapes still exist.\n\n  &gt; BTW, I happened to see Thomas C. Helm of San Francisco, CA listed among the new members in the September-October &#39;93 issue.  Time flies.\n\n  &gt; Jim\n\n\n\n\n  &gt;   I&#39;ll do it for free with whatever info I can get my hands on.\n\n  &gt;   As long as I don&#39;t go over my current bandwidth limit, I don&#39;t care\n  &gt;   how many people leech it off my server and I&#39;m T3 class. \n\n  &gt;   I will follow up with Barry Hennick when I see him, and I will ask the\n  &gt;   people in the Florida club.\n\n  &gt;   - darcy\n\n  &gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n  &gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n  &gt; nihontostudy-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n\n\n\n  &gt; Your use of Yahoo!
