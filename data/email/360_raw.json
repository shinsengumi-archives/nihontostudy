When you bid on an item and it is\n&gt;not sold you may receive an e-mail that purports to be from the seller\n&gt;offering to sell you the item very reasonably and requesting that you pay \n&gt;by\n&gt;wire transfer to an overseas bank.\n&gt;\n&gt;THIS IS A SCAM.  THE E-MAIL IS NOT FROM THE SELLER.      IF YOU SEND THE\n&gt;MONEY YOU WILL GET NOTHING BUT A LESSON IN FRAUD.\n&gt;\n&gt;Somehow an overseas con artist is obtaining the e-mails of bidders and them\n&gt;attaching the pictures and descriptions used in the original auction.\n&gt;\n&gt;Dale Garbutt\n&gt;4109-347-8710\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nMSN 8 with e-mail virus protection service: 2 months FREE*  \nhttp://join.msn.com/?page=features/virus\n\n\n"
