I am of the opinion that Shoami\nartisans were not productive there.\n\nThere are certainly pieces that have papered to just Mito.\nBut none that I know of to Mito Shoami,\nin which case the basic premise is incorrect.\n\nJim,\nThe book you are referring to I presume is titled:\nTetsu no Isho - Mito-To to Tosogu no Meihin (1996).\nIbaraki Prefectural Historical Museum.\n\nIn section II - Mito Kinko no Tosogu,\nThe introductory text records prominent individuals\nand groups that were active in Mito (Hitachi province).\nAmong them:\nGunji Yogoro\nYatabe Tsuji\nSeiryuken Ha\nIchiryu (Hitotsuyanagi) Ha\nTamagawa Ha\nUchikoshi Ha\nYasuchika Ha (from the 4th gen. Yasuchika)\nSaotome and Myochin.\nAnd of course, Hagiya Shohei (Katsuhira) and Unno Shomin.\n\n\nNO mention of Shoami in Mito.\n\nChecking Haynes- Tsuba, An Aesthetic Study.\nUnder the section dealing with SHOAMI he mentions:\nKyo Shoami, Awa Shoami, Bizen Shoami, Iyo Shoami,\nAizu Shoami, Shonai Shoami, Akita Shoami,\nBushu (Edo) Shoami & Sakushu (Mimasaka) Shoami.\nIn addition he adds individuals who signed:\nOshu Shoami, Soshu (Odawara) Shoami, Seishu (Ise) Shoami,\nOsaka (Settsu) Shoami, Banshu (Harima) Shoami,\nInshu (Inaba) Shoami & Kurume (Chikugo) Shoami.\n\nAgain NO mention of Mito Shoami.\n\nI have never liked the term Mito Shoami\nand have never used it. This thread presented\nan opportunity to research the issue\nto see if my opinion had any basis.\n\nCan anyone document a piece that has been\nauthoritatively classified as Mito Shoami\nor have we been perpetuating a fallacy?\n\nCary Condell\n\nCondell & Co., Ltd.\nP.O. Box 590115\nSan Francisco, CA 94159\n\nTel. 415-751-3784\n\ncondell@...\nhttp://www.ikkyudo.com\n\nJim Gilbert wrote:\n&gt; Rich & all,\n&gt; Alan is definitely correct.  While not always to my personal taste, \n&gt; there were a number of Mito lines producing very high quality fittings.  \n&gt; Several of these Mito lineage founders were students of leading kinko \n&gt; artists.  No doubt the Mito Tokugawa branch family (with 350,000 koku \n&gt; revenue) and their retainers were responsible for supporting these many \n&gt; skilled workers.\n&gt; \n&gt; The standardized plates, designs taken from copy books, large scale \n&gt; production and relatively poor quality are characteristics of the Mito \n&gt; Shoami.  Aizu Shoami workers did a lot of the same.\n&gt; \n&gt; There are some rather poor quality, unsigned Mito tsuba as well.  It&#39;s \n&gt; probably possible to find a group of better than average Mito Shoami \n&gt; work that exceeds the quality of the bottom of Mito production.  These \n&gt; lesser pieces are probably the source of the confusion between Mito and \n&gt; Mito Shoami.  I have seen some fairly insipid mumei tsuba with kanteisho \n&gt; to Mito.\n&gt; \n&gt; It&#39;s true that better Mito workers did copy Nara, Hamano and others, but \n&gt; their copy work is nothing like the Mito Shoami stuff after the Nara \n&gt; style.  If anything the workmanship of the Mito copies is a bit over the \n&gt; top compared with the originals.  It&#39;s also usually signed by the maker.\n&gt; \n&gt; There was a book on published 5-10 years ago on Mito swords and tosogu.  \n&gt; Mine is out on loan and I don&#39;t remember the title or author&#39;s name.  \n&gt; Does anyone have one handy?  In any event, that&#39;s a good book to look \n&gt; through to get a feel for the better Mito work.\n&gt; \n&gt; Jim\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   Rich,\n&gt;   I think you are mistaken in your appraisal of Mito work, the Mito Shoami\n&gt;   never achieved much prominence but the Mito Kinko are among the best \n&gt; artists\n&gt;   who ever made fittings, particularly in the late Edo/Meiji periods with\n&gt;   artists like Hagiya Katsuhei and Unno Shomin. They were also very able\n&gt;   copyists, I remember Mr Ono some years ago showed me a well known Somin\n&gt;   kozuka of a horse (seen from the rear) in takazogan, I asked him how \n&gt; to tell\n&gt;   the real thing from a Mito copy, he said the only difference was that \n&gt; in the\n&gt;   copy the horse stood more proud, or was it the other way around?\n&gt;   Alan\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n\n"
