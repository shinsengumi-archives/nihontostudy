I have seen this type of guard receive a kanteisho, but they are not held in the same regard as early Yamakichibei tsuba.\n\nWhat is the other guard made out of?  I have seen Kagamishi tsuba with that &quot;worm eaten&quot; design.  I haven&#39;t specifically seen it combined with mon like that, but I have seen the worm eaten rim combined with other motifs.  So, not unusual if it is done in a copper-based alloy with a dark patina.  \n\nThe photos make it look like an iron guard, and if it is then that is something I haven&#39;t seen before.  In that case I would guess that it&#39;s a cast taken from a Kagamishi tsuba.\nJim\n\n\n\n  Dear Listeros:\n\n  I was wondering if you could help me out on these 2 tsuba.\n\n  First is Yamakichibei:\n  http://www.nihontophile.com/Yamak1.jpg\n  http://www.nihontophile.com/Yamak2.jpg\n  Note that the plate looks old, old traces of lacquer and the tsuba \n  is of 3 plate construction (two thin outer layers and a thicker core-\n  you can see it in the hitsui ana).\n  Which generation?\n\n  Second I have never seen a tsuba like this:\n  http://www.nihontophile.com/Shoami1.jpg\n  http://www.nihontophile.com/Shoami2.jpg\n  Which school? (Shoami?)\n\n  Thanks very much for looking,\n  Ron\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
