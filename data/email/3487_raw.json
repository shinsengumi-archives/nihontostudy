It has some pitting in the mimi and \nrecently, in better light, I noticed for the first time, unmistakable \nlayers in these pitted area. Clearly 3 layers are visible.\n\nReading Masayuki Sasano, he talks about a famous tsuba by the shodai \nTadamasa that was burnt in a fire in the early 20th century, and how the \nlayers were revealed with this damage. He also mentions that if you can \nsee the layers with the tsuba in good condition, then it is not a great \ntsuba.\n\nAs the layers on mine are visible only in the pitting damage and no \nwhere else on the tsuba, I was wondering if this guard maybe older than \nI originally thought ?. When did the 3 layer construction finish/taper \noff in Akasaka tsuba production?, was it still in the first few Tadatoki \nor mostly with the first 4 masters.\n\nhttp://www.nihontomessageboard.com/personal/akasaka_geese_peony_ginger.jpg\n( note: the pitting never looks as bad in the hand as it does in this \nphoto )\n\ncheers\n\nRich\n-- \n*Richard Turner - Nihonto Message Board*\n/for the discussion of all things Nihonto./\nwww.nihontomessageboard.com &lt;http://www.nihontomessageboard.com/nmb/&gt;\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
