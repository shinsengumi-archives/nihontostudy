However, even sword-smiths\n&gt; are given o=\r\nnyomi or Sino-Japanese nicknames. Perhaps the most famous is\n&gt; Nagayoshi, w=\r\nho is typically called Chogi. There is also Hiroyoshi, whose\n&gt; nickname is =\r\nHiroga. Teimei may be a Japanese nickname for Sadanobu. I am\n&gt; pretty sure =\r\nyou would read his signature using the kunyomi. On the other\n&gt; hand, there =\r\nare lots of fittings makers whose name is read using the onyomi\n&gt; -- Tomei,=\r\n Somin, all the Goto guys. Even the Omori guys&#39; names are\n&gt; pronounced here=\r\n in Japan using the onyomi. I hope this is sufficiently\n&gt; confusing.\n&gt;\n&gt; Go=\r\nrdon\n&gt;\n&gt;   \n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
