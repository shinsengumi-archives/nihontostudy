I have a book entirely on Norisuke which\n&gt; I&#39;ll take a look at, soon. I&#39;m in the middle of\n&gt; photographing stuff in prep for our stein club\n&gt; meeting which I&#39;m hosting this weekend. )Yes, too\n&gt; many &quot;interests!&quot;) Anyway, I&#39;ll have a look in the\n&gt; book. No english but photos are pretty good. Once\n&gt; owned a mumei tsuba which was probably Norisuke\n&gt; work; Alan Harvie ended up with it. \n&gt; \n&gt; Ron\n&gt;   ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt;   From: Curran Campbell \n&gt;   To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n&gt;   Sent: Tuesday, July 11, 2006 10:58 AM\n&gt;   Subject: Re: [nihontostudy] Followup on Owari\n&gt; Kinko Tsuba and Norisuke\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   Alan,\n&gt; \n&gt;   The tsuba is very thick and rich shakudo. It is\n&gt; very\n&gt;   heavy. The gold wire used is also very heavy\n&gt; guage,\n&gt;   set extremely deep into channels. It has retained\n&gt;   about 99.9% of the inlay, but there is a small\n&gt; spot on\n&gt;   the mimi where I can see how deep the channels run\n&gt; and\n&gt;   the gold wire extends all the way into it.\n&gt; \n&gt;   According to Haynes and one or two other sources,\n&gt; the\n&gt;   Norisuke line did work in Kinko sometimes.\n&gt; \n&gt;   I am not saying with 100% certainty that this is a\n&gt;   Norisuke, but there is a similar tsuba out there\n&gt; by\n&gt;   Norisuke and the more that I look at other tsuba\n&gt; by\n&gt;   the Norisuke family, the more I see the same\n&gt; design\n&gt;   elements over and over again. Leaf shape. Flower\n&gt; petal\n&gt;   engraving. Flower engraving. General composition.\n&gt; Very\n&gt;   much like a painting, the great number of details\n&gt;   evident in a soft metal heavily carved piece like\n&gt; this\n&gt;   seem to me a signature. There is some variation,\n&gt; like\n&gt;   there is a very similar 1st gen Norisuke example\n&gt; with\n&gt;   near identical leaves, but the main vein of the\n&gt; leaf\n&gt;   is done in a single track of gold vs the double\n&gt; vein I\n&gt;   have on this leaf.\n&gt;   I like to figure things out before I submit them\n&gt; to\n&gt;   shinsa, and sometimes if I am happy enough with an\n&gt;   answer and intend to keep a piece- I don&#39;t submit\n&gt; to\n&gt;   shinsa. I&#39;d be surprised if I actually got a\n&gt;   &#39;Norisuke&#39; call on this, but as a\n&gt; newbie-intermediate\n&gt;   having something like this seem to click into\n&gt; place\n&gt;   has been very satisfying. Yet I may be absolutely\n&gt;   wrong! So if I can stand on someone&#39;s shoulder and\n&gt; see\n&gt;   further into this.... I welcome the view.\n&gt; \n&gt;   If you want to take a crack at the other tsuba\n&gt; that\n&gt;   has been a challenge for me, I will dig that photo\n&gt; out\n&gt;   too and post it. This &#39;Norisuke&#39; has been the more\n&gt;   interesting piece and horribly difficult to\n&gt; photograph\n&gt;   given the highly reflective shakudo and gold.\n&gt;   Photography is not a strong skill for me, yet the\n&gt;   devil of a good identification is also in the\n&gt; detail\n&gt;   of the other one.\n&gt; \n&gt;   Curran\n&gt; \n&gt;   --- Alan Bale &lt;abale@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt;   &gt; Is the tsuba iron or shakudo?
