Did swordsmiths, that made tsuba, sign any differently compared \n  to their sword mei ?. Did that have different designations ?, or use \n  alternate titles ?, and are there any records, i.e. references or books \n  showing Tosho tsuba mei ?.\n\n  I have seen various mei on tsuba by Masahide, Naotsuna, Naokatasu and \n  they are close, though the papered Naokatsu I have seen show some \n  differences. I have also recently come into possession of tsuba signed \n  Yasutsugu and Daido. I am looking at buying a Naokatsu tsuba when I am \n  in Japan next month.\n\n  Some of the greatest mid/late Edo sword smiths had a hand at making \n  tsuba and it appears that they, for the most part, did an excellent job. \n  I would be interested in any material, references and articles on this \n  subject. I have Roberts Haynes&#39; information in the Tsuba, an Aesthetic \n  guide and Nihonto Koza but would also like to read anything else that \n  might be about the place.\n\n  Cheers\n\n  Richard Turner\n\n\n\n   \n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
