I have a new piece, that I believe shows clear\n&gt; Tekkotsu and also lamination in the mimi.\n&gt;\n&gt; The images that follow ( sorry for the poor quality, I will try to get\n&gt; better ones this weekend ) are attempting to show what I am referring\n&gt; to. This first image looks like a lamination showing, and a small dent\n&gt; around the area in question.\n&gt;\nhttp://www.nihontomessageboard.com/tsuba_collection/Choshu_Kawaji/mimi-1.jpg\n&gt;\n&gt; This image is another lamination showing in another section of the mimi.\n&gt;\nhttp://www.nihontomessageboard.com/tsuba_collection/Choshu_Kawaji/mimi-3.jpg\n&gt;\n&gt; This section, I am trying to show what looks like running bones, but\n&gt; again, my photography skills fail me. Basically, through the highlite\n&gt; area, there is a bone running on the diagonal.\n&gt;\nhttp://www.nihontomessageboard.com/tsuba_collection/Choshu_Kawaji/mimi-2.jpg\n&gt;\n&gt; So, is this common for Choshu works, or is it is un common ?????. I\n&gt; believe the better works were from the earlier periods, though I am sure\n&gt; there are some excellent examples from the last smiths as well.\n&gt;\n&gt; Cheers\n&gt;\n&gt; Rich\n&gt; //\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
