Many mumie &quot;Rai&quot; swords are labeled &quot;Mihara&quot; by (what I think of as) conservative shinsa judges which of course speaks well for their workmanship. I own only one Mihara sword but it is a beauty, a &quot;masculine&quot; hirazukuri ko-wakizashi by a smith named Masachika. A sword friend found it in Oklahoma City area back around late 1970s and had it polished (beautifully) by Kajihara. It received Koshu Tokubetsu Keicho (so-called &quot;high green&quot; paper) from the NBTHK in 1979 but we never really figured out its age. Yamanaka insisted it was Nambokucho but my friend felt it more mid-Muromachi; today, I have not convinced myself one way or the other. My friend got disgusted with sword people in the mid-1980s and sold off his small but nice collection. I was able to purchase this blade at that time but nothing else, thanks to limited funds during that time of &quot;raising family&quot; years. Always wanted to let&#39;s say, &quot;honor&quot; this sword with an article, but being indecisive about its age...well...here it sits, unshared. I think it is time.\n\nRon \nSTL\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: Kenneth Wilson \n  To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Thursday, November 10, 2005 1:38 PM\n  Subject: Re: [nihontostudy] Mihara mei\n\n\n  The only thing I remember reading is that most\n  komihara are mumei.
