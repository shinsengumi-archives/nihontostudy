Given the style of the plate and shape and the angle of the kozuka ana (the oval opening) it may be as old as the late Muromachi to Momoyama period (late 16th C).  Given the style of raised rim, it would probably be designated as a Katchushi (armor maker&#39;s) tsuba, although that is more a convenient term than a literal truth.  It&#39;s a nicely proportioned and apparently well made guard, although simple.  It looks like there is black lacquer on a lot of the surface.\n\nThe style of the dragon on the other tsuba is typical for Echizen Kinai work from the mid to late Edo period.  It&#39;s often seen in larger tsuba, but less common in tanto guards.  Given the soft detail and the look of the seppa dai (the central flat oval) it might be cast.  I can&#39;t tell for sure from the photos.  \n\nWhat does the rest of the mounting with the older guard look like?\n\nJim\n\n\n\n  Hi\n\n  i made a trade a did get two &quot;Tantos&quot;, can anyone tell me something \n  about the tsubas that were mounted on them, se pics under photos \n  Tsubas2.jpg , would be nice to now age or something on them\n\n  Best Regards\n\n  Patrik\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
