The shape of the ana would be more indicative\n&gt;of a kogai rather than the size. Some early stuff with what can be taken as\n&gt;ubu-ana can be either very large or very small. Ko-Mino kogai come in a wild\n&gt;variety of sizes including pencil thin ones.\n&gt;\n&gt;Gordon\n&gt;  -----Original Message-----\n&gt;  From: Richard George [mailto:rkg@...]\n&gt;  Sent: Friday, April 25, 2003 2:18 PM\n&gt;  To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;  Subject: Re: [nihontostudy] Re: katana vs wakizashi\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  Hi,\n&gt;\n&gt;  Could it be that a some of these &quot;uchigatana sized&quot; tsuba got flipped\n&gt;  over and the kogai ana used for kozuka ana?\n&gt;\n&gt;  I have one piece where the side where most of the banging is around the\n&gt;  nakago ana would iply the hitsu ana was for a kozuka, but\n&gt;  from the shape the ana itself kind of looks  like it might have been for\n&gt;  a kogai, and there is some banging on the other side\n&gt;  that looks like they originally did on these pieces - check out:\n&gt;\n&gt;  http://home.teleport.com/~rkg/photos/tsuba/tosho3_front_small.JPG\n&gt;  http://home.teleport.com/~rkg/photos/tsuba/tosho3_back_small.JPG\n&gt;\n&gt;  Another couple of  explanations I&#39;d posit is that perhaps there were a\n&gt;  LOT more uchigatana\n&gt;  that weren&#39;t katana length or that perhaps  people were turning their\n&gt;  uchigatana into\n&gt;  wakizashi via shortening when it became the rage to have a\n&gt;  wakizashi.  It seems that a lot of the early tachi fittings got reused\n&gt;  in various ways - could it be that\n&gt;  a lot of these pieces got &quot;recycled&quot; into wakizashi one way or another,\n&gt;  hence the large number of early tsuba that have\n&gt;  the kozuka ana?.\n&gt;\n&gt;  donning the asbestos underwear...\n&gt;\n&gt;  rkg\n&gt;  (Richard George)\n&gt;\n&gt;  &gt;Hi,\n&gt;  &gt;Just time for a partial answer.  From early koshirae I have seen, katana\n&gt;are mounted with kogai only, kozuka and kogai, or neither.  I have not seen\n&gt;a katana mounted with only a kozuka.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;Wakizashi are very commonly mounted with only a kozuka, but are also seen\n&gt;with kozuka and kogai.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;The two files in the nihontostudy website File section include columns to\n&gt;indicate the kozuka and kogai configuration for each mounting in the Katana\n&gt;Koshirae catalog.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;We see a fair number of 8+ cm tsuba around with a kozuka ana cut in\n&gt;them...  were they really big wakizashi tsuba, were katana mounted with\n&gt;kozuka only at some point or was the ana used for a kogai, despite the\n&gt;kozuka shape?  I don&#39;t know.  There is one wakizashi koshirae in the spread\n&gt;sheet with an 8.6 cm tsuba, so that might be the explanation.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;I&#39;ll come back to this later.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;Jim\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;  Ken -\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;  Presence of kogai and kozuka ana are maybe part of the\n&gt;  &gt;  story. I asked Jim a similar question and as I understood\n&gt;  &gt;  his reply (perhaps he will elaborate); katana tsuba\n&gt;  &gt;  normally have both kozuka and kogai ana or either\n&gt;  &gt;  while wakizashi tsuba normally only have a kozuka ana.\n&gt;  &gt;  Although there are numerous exceptions; small sukashi\n&gt;  &gt;  tsuba which to my eye are obviously for a wakizashi\n&gt;  &gt;  based on size not uncommonly have both. Also many\n&gt;  &gt;  of the very early tosho and katchushi tsuba had\n&gt;  &gt;  only one (many had been added later). I hope I haven&#39;t\n&gt;  &gt;  done too much damage to what Jim had said. I&#39;m sure\n&gt;  &gt;  he will fill in the blanks.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;  Rich\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt;  &gt;nihontostudy-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;Your use of Yahoo!
