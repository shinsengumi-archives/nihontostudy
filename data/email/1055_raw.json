Never really thought about this too much before but I&#39;ve always thought for something to be considered mitokoro mono that they would have had to been made by one artist, as a set. Certainly these sets of kodogu come with impressive provenance but it did kind of surprise me to notice this about these sets. It would be interesting to see what the thinking is today (in the past) regarding mitokoro mono. Can a person &quot;assemble&quot; like fittings and call them mitokoro mono and if so, is this practice accepted out there in the market place? Maybe comparing &quot;values&quot; will reflect (explain) the difference between &quot;put together&quot; (if this is a correct term) mitokoro mono and those made by one artist &quot;as a set.&quot; Comments anyone?\n\nRon\nSTL\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
