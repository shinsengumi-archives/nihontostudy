It is of a violet/black shakudo, and was purchased by its \nprevious owner in 1938.  It depicts, in a delicate openwork, a bell \ncricket amidst suzuki grasses.  The grass is decorated with gold \ntaka-zogan dewdrops.\n\nI have always thought, by reason of the &#39;brightness&#39; of its \nexecution, the lack of any evidence of it ever having been mounted, \nand sekigane in the nakago-hitsu that appear more decorative than \nfunctional, that it was Edo work.\n\nDuring a recent visit to the Bing exhibition, at the Van Gough \nMuseum in Amsterdam, I saw a very similar guard on loan from the \nMuseum fur Kunst et Kewerbe in Hamburg - stupidly I omitted to \nrecord its accession number.  This was attributed to Nakai Zensuke \nTomotsune I (1669 -1730.  Can I be so wrong in the dating of my own \ntsuba?\n\nWith my thanks in advance for any suggestions\nJohn L.\n\n\n\n\n"
