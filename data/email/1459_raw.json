Large pieces of iron would have been very expensive but large rocks were free except for the lifting, hauling and dressing.  I&#39;ve read some speculation somewhere about stone anvils having an influence on early sword steel patterns.  When it comes to finish work on tsuba it&#39;s easier to make and use a stone texture punch than trying to hammer on a stone get the texture.  If anyone wants to make such a punch, all it takes is a cheap propane torch, a rod of tool steel, a rock and a hammer.  I can tell you how to do it.\n\nJim\n  Would love to find out if they did indeed use\n  an irregular hammer and anvil in the old days, I wonder if anyone else\n  could give us some more thoughts on this? \n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
