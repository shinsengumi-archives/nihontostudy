That is not a criticism, just\nan indication that it is a process linked to subjectivity and\ndifferences of opinion.\n\nAs such, are we to make the irreversible and destructive action of\nremoving a signature in order to obtain whatever opinion has been\nwithheld because current scholarship would indicate the signature is\nbad? \n\nCertainly that too will be on a case by case basis, and while some are a\nclear cut &quot;hee hee this &#39;masamune&#39; mei is bad, remove it&quot; others may not\nbe so clear.\n\nIt would be nice if an avenue existed where one could obtain the best\nofficial opinion without possibly destroying something that might be,\nafter all, correct and deemed so by future generations of scholars.\n\nI have a sword that falls into these categories. I would never remove\nthe mei from it, and I am 90% sure that it will fail shinsa, and I am\n60% sure that it is gimei.\n\nI don&#39;t want to go and smash up something that existed for three hundred\nyears though, should it be correct in the end. I am not even sure how\ngood I feel about removing it if it is only grafitti as it is part of\nthe history of the sword.\n\n- darcy\n\n\n\n"
