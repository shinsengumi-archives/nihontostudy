Toppei I believe refers to the \nshape of the kashira and kojiri IE; tapering. I agree with all that \nJim has said, I believe these were popular at the tail end of the Edo \nperiod when Western weapons and tactics were being fervently studied \nby the Japanese.\n\tThis style of koshirae could be used with hakama or European \ntrousers, hence the swivel often seen. The swivelling &quot;kurikata&quot; \nallowed the sword to be thrust thru the Obi or slung &quot;backward&quot; in \nwestern fashion when dressed in pants.\n\tThe gunto koshirae is an extension of this idea and one can \nsee how many different ways were invented to allow quick conversion \nfrom saber to uchigatana...\n\tMore often than not these are of superior workmanship. My \nbelief is that the new officers of the newly formed rifle or \nartillery units went for this style and most of them with the money \nto get a special set up like this were likely sons of the Bakufu. \nThere is one memorable example of this style which is decidedly \ncommon, showing rough simple work suitable more for a foot soldier \nthan an officer; That would be Saigo Takamoris&#39; shuzaya toppei \ngoshirae which carried a gimei Muramasa blade.\n\tI think this little tanto exhibits all the features of a \nquality koshirae in this style. There is one more feature not yet \nmentioned and that is that Toppei koshirae typically feature iron \nfittings with silver inlay (sometimes gold).\n\tThat really is all I know (or have been taught). Thirsting for more,\nTom\n\n"
