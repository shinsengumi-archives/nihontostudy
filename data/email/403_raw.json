I do not think I have ever seen one like=\r\n it.  Not the design or the unusually shaped large kozuka hitsu.  Sort of l=\r\nike some of the early Jingo but different.\n\nThe shape of the nakago ana is =\r\nalso unusual in that it does not have the shape you would expect to see tha=\r\nt would tightly fit a nakago, and I think it would be difficult to fit a se=\r\nppa without covering the sukashi design.\n\nThe look of the iron on the plate=\r\n seems a little coarser and I do not see any of the large bones in the surf=\r\nace of the plate.  Its hard to tell from pictures though.  The hoan tsuba I=\r\n have handled have been abut 1.2 to 1.3mm thick.\n\nVery interesting unusual =\r\ntsuba.\n\nJohn\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: Richard Turner \n  To: =\r\nnihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Wednesday, June 25, 2003 5:18 AM\n  Su=\r\nbject: [nihontostudy] Tsuba ID\n\n\n    Greeting all, I have added some pics t=\r\no my site, see here\n\n  http://www.whiz.com.au/richard/Sukashi%20Wheel%20Tsu=\r\nba.htm\n\n  and am curious as to thoughts on this piece. It is signed but ver=\r\ny hard \n  to read, I think Yoshi ??? but not sure. It was bought as H=F4an =\r\nschool, \n  momoyama period but I am unsure of that also. I don&#39;t think it i=\r\ns that \n  old but again I could be wrong. it is 73 mm wide x 77 mm high and=\r\n 2.5 mm \n  and has a nice feel and look to it.\n\n  any thought&#39;s as to schoo=\r\nl, age etc. would be greatly appreciated.\n\n  cheers\n\n  Rich\n\n\n\n\n        Yah=\r\noo!
