I am working on the inscription ( should keep me busy for day&#39;s ) but am wondeing, when did Kao come into use on Sword mei ?, was this a Shinto or Shinshinto thing ? or did it happen in the earlier periods ?.\n\nThis sword is dated ???? ????  the 4th year of Bunsei ( 1821 ) I will have to work on the front section, I assume it is a month or something. The mei will take a lot longer :-)\n\ncheers all\n\nRich\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
