That would\nbe a 100 point koshirae.\n\nEach deviation from that state has a corresponding point reduction.\n\nI agree with Gordon&#39;s comments about preservation standards and\npractices in Japan and I believe that foreign collectors should\nunderstand and apply these standards to their own practice.  This\napproach tends to keep the dimensions I outlined above in balance.\n\nUnfortunately, a lot of koshirae submitted to the overseas shinsa have\nthese dimensions knocked out of balance due to overzealous restoration,\nreplacement or outright fabrication.\n\nThere isn&#39;t a formula for this, so I will provide some anecdotes that I\nthink will get the general idea across.\n\n- The biggest upsets seem to result from newly built koshirae.  An owner\nwill collect a group of old fittings, sometimes of very nice quality,\nand have a koshirae made up with a new saya and tsuka foundation.  This\nwill not pass shinsa and the owner will be unhappy, particularly when he\nsees original koshirae with fittings that are not nearly as nice as his\npass with above average point values. \n\n- These other koshirae can have very plain fittings that on their own\nwould not even be seen as being collectible by most.  However, when they\nare all original and in good condition they can do quite well as a\nkoshirae, often to the surprise of their owners who thought the mount\nwas nothing special because the fittings weren&#39;t fancy.\n\n- An otherwise original, good looking koshirae with a newly made saya\nwill fail.\n\n- An original koshirae with a refinished old saya will suffer a major\npoint reduction.  If the mount is otherwise fairly good and well\npreserved, the refinished saya will probably drive it into the\nshinteisho point range (60-69).  If the mount is not so good, the saya\ncan drive it below 60 points which translates to failing shinsa.  An\n&quot;auto body&quot; job on a saya will almost certainly drag any koshirae below\n60 points.\n\n- A slightly damaged but original saya will suffer a point reduction,\nbut probably not as big a one as a new or badly restored one will.  Too\nmuch damage can pull the piece into the shinteisho or failing range.\n\n- A new tsuka foundation, while less obvious than a new saya, will fail.\n\n- Same that is obviously new will result in a major point reduction, but\nin practice is usually accompanied by enough additional poor\n&quot;restoration&quot; to result in failure.\n\n- It is a plus to keep old tsuka ito (mid Edo or older) intact, even if\nit is damaged or dirty.  Clumsy recent tsuka ito work will result in a\nsignificant point reduction.  Good quality recent tsuka ito work is a\nlesser reduction.  I personally believe that destroying an older wrap is\na very bad practice, but at shinsa there is no way to know what was\nremoved before the new wrap was applied.  A koshirae that should have\ntsuka ito but does not have it will usually fail.\n\n- Missing kurikata, koiguchi, etc. will result in a point reduction.\nBadly restored kurikata, koiguchi, etc., will also result in a point\nreduction.  Ones restored to professional Japanese standards are\ngenerally overlooked.\n\n- A missing kozuka or kogai where there should be one will result in a\npoint reduction, as will one inappropriate to the koshirae.  A gimei\nkozuka or kogai will result in failure of the koshirae, although it is\nusually possible to certify the koshirae excluding that fitting.  \n\n- A koshirae with gimei or reproduction tsuba, menuki,  fuchigashira or\nany fitting that cannot be excluded will fail.\n\n- An original sageo is a slight plus.  A missing or modern one is\nignored.\n\n- Missing seppa tend to be overlooked, but ill-fitting western ones are\nworse than none. \n\n- In general minor repairs done to high quality Japanese standards will\nbe overlooked, but ones done poorly and/or in non-Japanese standards\nwill be downgraded.\n\n- Put-together koshirae from old saya and tsuka will fail if detected...\nand they are detected.\n\n- Restoration work that is good enough to escape detection will escape\ndetection.\n\nJim\n\n\n\n\n  Jim, care to comment?\n\n\n\n  Gordon\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\nYahoo!
