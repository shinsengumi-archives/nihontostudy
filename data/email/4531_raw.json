I=92ve=\r\n had numerous\nindividuals come up and ask me what I think of the quality of=\r\n utsuri in\ntheir blade, the amount of kinsuji, or to comment on the beauty =\r\nof the\nchikei, when none of the features were present. It=92s as if learnin=\r\ng jargon\nis taking the place of actual study =96 hands on study with good s=\r\nwords that\nactual have some of these features. Then, it would not be possib=\r\nle for there\nto be a market for these Chinese swords. \n\n \n\nI might add that=\r\n I myself, and even Yoshikawa sensei, have been sent e-mails\nor letters fro=\r\nm Thailand, Indonesia and who knows where else asking us to\neither buy or t=\r\no comment on this garbage. In each case I have told the\nindividual exactly =\r\nwhat they have, if they bought them, they should report\nthe seller for frau=\r\nd, or if they are the seller, warning them that they can\nbe prosecuted for =\r\nattempting to perpetrate a fraud. Unfortunately, people\nare still being tak=\r\nen. I would hope that when Bob Benson or anyone else puts\non a display of t=\r\nop quality pieces somewhere in the States, everyone takes\nthe opportunity t=\r\no go and learn.\n\n \n\nJust my morning rant.\n\n \n\nGordon\n\n \n\n-----Original Mess=\r\nage-----\nFrom: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com [mailto:nihontostudy@yahoogroup=\r\ns.com] On\nBehalf Of Ron Hartmann\nSent: Saturday, October 14, 2006 1:35 AM\nT=\r\no: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: Re: [nihontostudy] Re: any comment=\r\ns about this sword?\n\n \n\nHi all - \n\nOne of the now-famous &quot;Chinese&quot; Japanese=\r\n swords came to me for opinion this\nweek. Talking to the fellow prior to th=\r\ne visit, I felt he had to be\ndescribing a &quot;ringer.&quot; You wouldn&#39;t believe wh=\r\nat he all saw in that sword\nand how excited he was about this &quot;ancient&quot; swo=\r\nrd! I did ask if he wanted\n&quot;the truth&quot; about if when he came over, and he s=\r\naid yes. It took a couple\nhours and some show-and-tell to convince him. (He=\r\n swore some Japanese\noffered him $10K for this sword six months back!) \n\nMy=\r\n question here today...this sword had the typical &quot;etched&quot; hada that you\nco=\r\nuld see from across the room. Has anyone figured out if these swords are\nbe=\r\ning actually &quot;forged and acid etched&quot; or if this so-called &quot;hada&quot; is\napplie=\r\nd and etched (probably similar to fake damascus)? I couldn&#39;t say one\nway or=\r\n the other 100% but suspect it is &quot;applied.&quot; The nakago looked raw and\ncert=\r\nainly not something that even a blacksmith would make. Odd kanji, etc.,\nand=\r\n unfinished. \n\nComments?\n\nRon\nSTL\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: Ann-M=\r\narie \nTo: nihontostudy@ &lt;mailto:nihontostudy%40yahoogroups.com&gt; yahoogroups=\r\n.com \nSent: Friday, October 13, 2006 11:10 AM\nSubject: Re: [nihontostudy] R=\r\ne: any comments about this sword?\n\nthis sword has never been on ebay. and y=\r\nes there are many fakes that look\nsimilar that are on ebay.\n\ngermanbudoka &lt;=\r\neckido@... &lt;mailto:eckido%40gmx.net&gt; &gt; wrote: --- In\nnihontostudy@ &lt;mai=\r\nlto:nihontostudy%40yahoogroups.com&gt; yahoogroups.com,\n&quot;molto10&quot; &lt;molto10@...=\r\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; www.geocities.com/molto10/sword/sword.html\n&gt;\nIf I remember goo=\r\nd, this item was article in Ebay one week ago.
