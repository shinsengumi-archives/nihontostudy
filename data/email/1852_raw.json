The bottom part of the first character is the same as in the bottom part of the gyosho style writing of sada (Self/Hirose 384) and kore (S/H 782), but the upper part of those kanji in gyosho or sosho style are different.  I can&#39;t find any kanji that fit reasonably with a gyosho writing of the whole with that lower part.\n\nLooking through the gyosho/sosho section at the end of the Daijiten I find a very similar rendering of AI / chika.  The kaisho style writing of AI is much more complex, but here are two &quot;script&quot; versions of that character in the Daijiten:\n\nhttp://tinyurl.com/37z8y\n\nI don&#39;t find any makers listed with the name Airi or Chikatoshi, or under any variations I could come up with, including other possible but less likely kanji.  The tsuba is interesting only because the workmanship is very similar to the many unsigned shiiremono variations taken from Kaneie and Nara styles.  The taganemei also look like the ones on those shiiremono.  Unfortunately there isn&#39;t a place or group name inscribed here.  Given the workmanship I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if the maker has not been recorded, but I hope that someone can do better than me with the reading and research on this one.  It&#39;d be good to pin these things down.\n\nJim\n\n\n\n  Hi Gordon, Rich Stein has suggested, and cleverly so I think, that it \n  may be Mitsu (robinson 48) in a stylistic form.\n\n  Rich\n\n  Gordon Robson wrote:\n\n  &gt; Even in May, this mei is difficult.
