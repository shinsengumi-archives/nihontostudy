It doesn&#39;t look like it will become uniform on its own over time (short of waiting for it to turn entirely black).  I have no personal experience with repatinating silver, but I think that this may need professional work to restore an even patina.  \n\nI don&#39;t think that the present condition of the patina would be a killer at shinsa, but it would result in a &quot;point&quot; reduction.  Polishing the fittings would definitely be worse than leaving them as-is.  \n\nDoubt I told you anything you didn&#39;t already know...\nJim\n\n\n  Anyone have recommendations about the care and feeding of silver\n  fittings (Jim?). I&#39;m guessing leave it alone and don&#39;t touch it.\n\n  The patina on silver is caused unfortunately by sulphur in the air,\n  which is a product of the industrial revolution. Black Tarnish (silver\n  sulfide) is not a native and normal patina for old silver in the days\n  when it was made... it&#39;s pretty uneven on the tsuba as can be seen, and\n  the kashira is also kind of rough.\n\n  I do want to know though if there is a proper care procedure if someone\n  does know. As well, I&#39;d like to submit this koshirae for papers and\n  want to make sure I&#39;m doing everything right.\n\n  - darcy\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
