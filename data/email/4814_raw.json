We did go to the Gun show here in Dallas today.  Sold the WWII Japanese rifle we had - it was not a very good piece and I&#39;m glad to have it out of the closet.  Had several people look at the sword.  The blade, as has been pointed out by some of you, was not signed and it has one nick that is slightly too big to be polished out, which detracts considerably from the value.  There was concurance that this sword was made in the 1600s and is a Washika (spelling) the shoter sword.  Everyone liked the tsuba, end cap and collar.  I got offered about $500 for the tsuba and $100 each for the collar and end cap, but just $300 for the whole thing!  The conclusion I came to was that a gun show was really more like a giant pawn shop than the place to really get a fair assessment of value, but it was very interesting, I ran into at least 3 of my co-workiers from Lockheed who had booths,  and I did come\n away knowing a few things:  1.  the sword is old and really not in bad shape - I can continue to use it in the event of an intruder and could probably take one out with it - I&#39;m not a handgun fan :-)  2.  If I really had it appraised, documented, or auctioned, I&#39;d get $1500 or so for it, 3.  I like it more than that so will be keeping it for the forseeable future.  I&#39;ll probably drop out of this group in a few weeks having accomplished my mission, but thanks for the education.  I can sure see how this could become a very interesting hobby.\n   \n  Becky\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
