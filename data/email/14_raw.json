It&#39;s like the wire, leaves and beads are\non top of the plate. Don&#39;t know if Nara did that.\n\n&gt; C, Kanayama, or maybe Owari \n\nI think possibly either.\n\n&gt; D, Ito maybe.\n\nI&#39;m guessing either katchushi or Shoami.\n \n&gt; \n&gt; That was my tsuba kantei for the day :-). \n&gt; how did I score. \n&gt; \n&gt; Rich T\n\nThanks for the suggestions.\n\nRich S\n------------------------------------------------------------\n Richard Stein, PhD          alchemyst@...\n      \n             The Japanese Sword Index\n  http://www.geocities.com/alchemyst/nihonto.htm\n  http://home.earthlink.net/~steinrl/nihonto.htm\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n"
