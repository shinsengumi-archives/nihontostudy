A \nbroken tip unfortunately &lt;WBR&gt;will require a foundation polish  making it \ndifficult to get away with anything short of a costly polish an good polisher. \n\nregards, Franco&gt;&gt;\n \nFranco:\n \nThe amount of money I have invested in this blade is a whole $40.00  US.  The \namount  of material loss at the Kissaki  having looked  at it with my glasses \non is less  than  3/64&quot; to my tired old  eyes.\n \nI am thinking of sending it out, having it polished and remounted, now the  \nquestion is to whom do I send it to for the polish. Fed Lohman has a gentleman  \nwho does polishing but I do not know of anyone who has used him and I do not  \nwant this blade ruined as I already saved it for a horrible fate as a yard \nwork  tool...\n \nThere is a lot of activity (due to the water/brine quenching)  along  the \nHamon that I can still see a bit though the very light surface oxidation.. I  \ncould be wrong but I feel that it could benefit from restoration, even as a  \nsimple &quot;what the heck, let&#39;s do it&quot; type of project.\n \nI just don&#39;t want to be trying to make a silk purse out of a sow&#39;s ear if  \nyou know what I mean... I will try to get some photos taken if I can get decent  \nones out of my ancient camera.\n \nNow it is my understanding from the research that I have done that Kanesane  \ndid make quite a few blades personally, as well as supervising his production  \ncompany, how do I tell for sure  if this is a production blade or one he  \nmade himslef. I am leaning towards the former due to the Seki stamp on the  \nnakago.\n \nAny help is greatly appreicated.\n \nTHANK YOU\n \nJPH\n \n \nDr JP  Hrisoulas, COL NANG (Ret)\nBladesmith.\nAuthor: The Complete  Bladesmith\nThe Master Bladesmith\nThe Pattern Welded Blade\nhttp: _www.atar.com_ (http://www.atar.com/) \n\n**************A Good Credit Score is 700 or Above.
