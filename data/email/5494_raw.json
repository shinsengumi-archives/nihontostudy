The brass fittings do not look to be of Japanese\n&gt; &gt; workmans=\r\nhip, especially the lack of a proper and neat finish where the\n&gt; &gt; metal\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; edges meet the scabbard wood. This is especially true where the handle\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; butts\n&gt; &gt; up to the habaki. The lack of a facing metal piece to the habak=\r\ni\nindicates\n&gt; &gt; poor workmanship. It may all be modern, but the proof of th=\r\ne\npudding for\n&gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; blade will be when you take the handle off and se=\r\ne the tang. Do this -\n&gt; &gt; remove the habaki and take good closeup photos of=\r\n both sides of\nthe tang\n&gt; &gt; and\n&gt; &gt; put them up. The blade is the typical s=\r\nhape of a Meiji tourist\npiece, but\n&gt; &gt; running through the images again I&#39;m=\r\n of the opinion that the\nkoshirae is\n&gt; &gt; modern as it just does not have th=\r\ne refinement of shape that we\nexpect to\n&gt; &gt; see in Japanese workmanship. So=\r\n the blade may be old, but if it\ndoes not\n&gt; &gt; have a clear and distinguisha=\r\nble hamon it is nonetheless a &quot;junk&quot;\npiece.\n&gt; &gt; Regards,\n&gt; &gt; Barry Thomas\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; (Melbourne, Australia)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ----- Original Message -----\n&gt; &gt; From: Pa=\r\ntrik Danielsson\n&gt; &gt; To: nihontostudy@ &lt;mailto:nihontostudy%40yahoogroups.co=\r\nm&gt;\nyahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt; Sent: Thursday, November 27, 2008 8:27 AM\n&gt; &gt; Subjec=\r\nt: [nihontostudy] Question about a small Tanto or??\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hello everybody=\r\n, i bought this small &quot;tanto&quot; on an ad here in Sweden.\n&gt; &gt; Its feel really =\r\ngenunine, some kind of hard wood whith nice\ngraining in\n&gt; &gt; saya\n&gt; &gt; and ts=\r\nuka, on some places it looks like all the brass has been\n&gt; &gt; silverplated\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; (can still se it above tha habaki on one of the photos), i have\nnot been=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; able to take the tsuka of it yet,but i gonna do that,(depending of the=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; answers here :-)\n&gt; &gt; Can this be a &quot;tourist&quot; thing , or is it made for=\r\n a child , women or\n&gt; &gt; something like that?, if someone have some info age=\r\n or something i\nwill\n&gt; &gt; really happy.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The blade from grip (above h=\r\nabaki) to tip is 6.5 inches / 17 cm,\nand the\n&gt; &gt; total is 10 inches/ 25.5 c=\r\nm.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Here is some pictures of it:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; http://s74.photobuc\n&gt; &gt; &lt;ht=\r\ntp://s74.photobucket.com/albums/i248/wellcraftantiqua/japan/&gt;\n&gt; &gt; ket.com/a=\r\nlbums/i248/wellcraftantiqua/japan/\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Thanks alot\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Patrik\n&gt; &gt; .=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ----=\r\n------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; No virus fou=\r\nnd in this incoming message.\n&gt; &gt; Checked by AVG.\n&gt; &gt; Version: 7.5.549 / Vir=\r\nus Database: 270.9.10/1814 - Release Date:\n&gt; &gt; 2008-11-26\n&gt; &gt; 20:53\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"
