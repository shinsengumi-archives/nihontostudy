No, not me, I am not that respectable.\nOther than that, there are a few collectors scattered allover the \nlandscape that may be willing to show you their stuffs but they have \nto know you well first, I reckon.

A lot of rusty tsuba I am working on but \nI do say my hawk paintings are quite outstanding, 50 + now, not too \nshabby.90+ % edo period, Soga school, Kano school, Tosa school, I \nlove them.\n\nMilt\n\n\n\n\nYahoo!
