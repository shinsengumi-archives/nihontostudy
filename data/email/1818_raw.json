You could buy a fairly nice tsuba with that money.  There&#39;s a Nobuyoshi that worked in Edo, born in 1807 and died in 1878.  Some of his signatures are illustrated in Wakayama, but I notice that the listing isn&#39;t up on the site any longer and I didn&#39;t compare them when I had the chance.\n\nJim\n\n  Although I know nothing about anything really, I think it is pretty\n  obvious that this piece does not have anywhere near the quality to\n  warrant such a high price...... Opinions?\n\n  Matt\n\n  It is interesting that the paper looks like a dealer&#39;s paper and there\n  is no actual discussion of the tsuba anywhere on the page. Looks like\n  someone scamming. It is not even that good of a tsuba. I am not familiar\n  with this maker, perhaps Jim can shed some light on that.\n\n  Gordon\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
