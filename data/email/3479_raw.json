While there is quite a bit of =\r\nevidence relating to the trade in weapons in the Muromachi period between J=\r\napan and China, the style of the tsuba you have illustrated is not of a sty=\r\nle from this period of trade, but from a much later period.  There have bee=\r\nn many discussions trying to determine what happened to the thousands of sw=\r\nords exported to China during this period.  Also the popular opinion is tha=\r\nt these swords were mounted in koshira, so would have had the required tsub=\r\na and other fittings, at least on a portion of the swords exported even if =\r\nnot all.  Seeing as the numbers exported were in the tens of thousands over=\r\n a long period, it seems reasonable to think there should be a quantity of =\r\ntsuba remaining from these weapons.\n\nHere is a link to a picture of a tsuba=\r\n that I think was made for this export market in Japan, and it is in the st=\r\nyle and iron of the period used in Japan, it is the second picture from the=\r\n top.  If you look at the next picture it is of a similar style of tsuba bu=\r\nt the iron is different as is the style of construction and it is from a la=\r\nter period of production even though of a similar style, and is about 100 y=\r\nears later in manufacture.  This would cause one to wonder if this trade co=\r\nntinued though the years but perhaps in smaller quantities.\n\nhttp://www3.te=\r\nlus.net/sword/sword/index.htm/MyWebs6/tsb1gal.htm\n\nJohn\n  ----- Original Me=\r\nssage ----- \n  From: Barry Thomas \n  To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n  Se=\r\nnt: Thursday, November 17, 2005 4:20 AM\n  Subject: Re: [nihontostudy] Re: A=\r\n good story about one tsuba with some interesting details missing\n\n\n  Mr Ch=\r\nen Ying-chaw wrote:\n\n  &gt; It was Japan who kept the record in detail about p=\r\nresenting\n  &gt; swords to Chinese emperors during 15th century.

I bel=\r\nieve this is known as the\n  Kango Trade in the Kamakura period and later.  =\r\nThis was published in English\n  about 25 or so years ago in the USA - one o=\r\nf the Tai Kai publications. I had not\n  read of the Trade in the early Shin=\r\nto period/late Ming, but of course this is\n  not a well-researched area in =\r\nthe West, nor, I guess, in China either given the\n  vicissitudes of the pas=\r\nt 110 years.  With this lack of knowledge it isn&#39;t\n  surprising that no one=\r\n (?) on this list knows anything about such a tsuba as Mr\n  Chen Ying-chaw =\r\nhas drawn our attention to.  So, given this lack of specific\n  knowledge ab=\r\nout the Japan-China trade in Nihonto I can only go by the tsuba AS A\n  TSUB=\r\nA in the context of my Japanese-centred knowledge.  More and better quality=\r\n\n  images of this very interesting tsuba are warranted given the queries an=\r\nd issues\n  raised.\n\n  I&#39;ve looked long and hard at the very interesting ima=\r\nge Mr Chen Ying-chaw has\n  drawn our attention to, and I note the following=\r\n:\n\n  - the quality of the work is poor.\n  - note particularly the asymmetri=\r\nc shape of the nakago ana, as I have mentioned\n  - note also the clumsy, un=\r\nrefined shape of the seppa dai outline\n  - note also the nakago ana placeme=\r\nnt in the seppa dai lacks symmetry.\n  - finally, the mimi (rim) varies in w=\r\nidth in a manner most uncharacteristic of\n    Japanese tsubako.\n\n  Being fa=\r\nmiliar with the exquisite excellence of Japanese metal work in tsuba and\n  =\r\nfuchigashira, I cannot accept that this tsuba was made under the auspices o=\r\nf the\n  Japanese Emperor for the Chinese Emperor.  Let me propose another t=\r\nheory.\n\n  Mr Chen Ying-chaw notes:\n\n  &gt; 1. Chinese emperor was the only one=\r\n who is entitled\n  &gt; to put dragon decors on everything he owned.\n  &gt; 2. Ho=\r\nwever dragons could also put to use as icons by\n  &gt; other persons or entiti=\r\nes only if the number of dragon&#39;s\n  &gt; fingers reduced to either 4 or 3. Fiv=\r\ne fingers claws must\n  &gt; not be used in any dragon unless the owner of that=\r\n\n  &gt; dragon design is Chinese emperor himself. Violation of\n  &gt; such rule w=\r\nas subject to capital punishment.\n\n  However, in Japan the dragon is a very=\r\n common theme on all manner of things.\n  Granted I have only seen 3 fingere=\r\nd dragons in Japanese art, but the so-called\n  Canton tsuba were imported i=\r\nnto Japan and I suggest that this tsuba could be of\n  Chinese origin intend=\r\ned to be exported to Japan at one time.  Supporting this\n  theory is the ob=\r\nservation that this tsuba appears to have never been fitted to a\n  sword, a=\r\ns indeed a great number of Japanese tsuba were never fitted to swords.\n  I =\r\ncannot recall seeing hitsuana of the specific type shown in the image.\n\n  F=\r\ninally, Mr Chen Ying-chaw wrote:\n\n  &gt; Time and again in China, very fine qu=\r\nality old Japanese\n  &gt; swords (for royal use?) can still be found. Some wit=\r\nh\n  &gt; tsuba missing\n\n  Some years ago there was a very comprehensive (but n=\r\not particularly\n  informative!) exchange of views on Nihonto in China on th=\r\nese sword lists - I\n  still have the correspondence in my archive.  There w=\r\nas no conclusive\n  information of &quot;very fine quality old Japanese swords&quot; b=\r\neing found in China.\n  I&#39;m sure we would all like to hear more about such f=\r\ninds with pictures and\n  scholarly information if they exist.  Indeed, the =\r\narticle on the Kango Trade\n  speculated that many of the very best quality =\r\nKoto were exported to China and\n  hoped that some could still be found and =\r\nrestored to the world.\n\n  This exhausts my poor and inadequate opinion, so =\r\nnow I will retire from the\n  lists and hope someone can offer a more defini=\r\ntive opinion.  I stand by my\n  opinion that this is NOT a Japanese-made ite=\r\nm.\n\n  Best regards,\n\n  Barry Thomas\n  (Melbourne, Australia)\n\n\n  ----- Orig=\r\ninal Message -----\n  From: &quot;sosidore&quot; &lt;sosidore@...&gt;\n  To: &lt;nihont=\r\nostudy@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n  Sent: Thursday, November 17, 2005 2:29 PM\n  Subje=\r\nct: [nihontostudy] Re: A good story about one tsuba with some interesting\n =\r\n details missing\n\n\n  It was Japan who kept the record in detail about prese=\r\nnting swords to\n  Chinese emperors during 15th century.
