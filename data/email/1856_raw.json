When writing in gyosho style the strokes flow together and there can be some simplification, but you don&#39;t add in extra things.  That loop stroke is usually used to combine a vertical and horizontal stroke.  \n\nThe more &quot;cursive&quot; types of writing can look so stylized that it seems like anything goes, but they&#39;re still written based on the strokes and order of the basic &quot;printing.&quot;  Putting in an extra stroke changes the kanji.\n\nAnyway,\nJim\n\n\n\n  Thanks Jim, always appreciated. A collector in Japan has suggested it is \n  MITSUTOSHI, KIKUOKA school. I was looking through the Mitsu&#39;s in \n  Murtha&#39;s book seeing if there was anything in there and I noticed \n  several Mitsu&#39;s written in a similar way, even though they are his \n  interpretation in writing, I though they were vaguely similar.\n\n  Cheers\n\n  Rich\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
