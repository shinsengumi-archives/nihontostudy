The obverse reads, &#39;Surrendered by Shosa \n(Major) Nagamura Kiyotaka, Japanese VIII army, Emirau Island, 21st March \n1944&#39;.  The reverse reads, &#39;To A. B. Boyles, U.S.M.C.&#39;.  This is an \nexample of a spurious postwar engraving added to increase value:  \nresearch indicates that Emirau was evacuated by the Japanese two months \nbefore the invasion of the US 4th Marines on 20 March 1944.  The USMC \nhas no record of an A. B. Boyles. (R. Gregory collection.)\n\nMy point is, there are swords with Inscriptions on them.  You need to \nthoroughly check it out.  Research your pieces.\n\nKim\n\nnwuinfo wrote:\n\n&gt;The story about warrior&#39;s name is bs. The story about special\n&gt;presentation fittings is most likely bs too - if you want an opinion\n&gt;it&#39;s possible if you provide some pictures.\n&gt;\n&gt;If there is a swastika on the scabbard - it&#39;s a chinese fake. If you\n&gt;can find a sword on e-bay that looks 100% like yours - it&#39;s a chinese\n&gt;fake.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;No problem, I dont know what I have it wasnt what I bought in the \n&gt;&gt;auction ... lol .. and everyone here abouts has his own opinion, but \n&gt;&gt;I rather get the opinions of true collector, that why the post.\n&gt;&gt;Ran\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;Yahoo!
