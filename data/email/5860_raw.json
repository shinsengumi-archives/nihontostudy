It had gone straight from the forge to the Shrine and was still in \n  shiratogi. Alan&#39;s find is indeed remarkable, and thank you for sharing \n  Alan. If I might comment, like David Zincavage I&#39;ve been unhappy with the \n  esnips protocol for looking at photos on their website. Alan, if you would \n  care to upload them to a yahoo folder or http://photobucket.com/ I would \n  love to see them. The last time I used it Photobucker required you to \n  create an account, but that is all.\n\n  Regards,\n  Barry Thomas.\n\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: &quot;abale.vossnet.co.uk&quot; &lt;abale@...&gt;\n  To: &quot;Nihonto Study&quot; &lt;nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n  Sent: Saturday, July 23, 2011 4:39 AM\n  Subject: [nihontostudy] Nagamaki\n\n  Members of the list have rightly been sceptical of my find as it is almost \n  unheard of in the West, if I had not seen it myself I would not have \n  believed it either. I have seen many swords with Muromachi/Momoyama style \n  koshirae over the years, but 99.9% have been 19th c. swords in retro style. \n  Two exceptions come to mind: Victor Harris and I catalogued the blades in \n  the Museum of Japanese Sword Fittings in Tokyo for Christie&#39;s in &#39;05. In \n  that collection was a Momoyama tachi koshirae that was later sold in NY, the \n  other was an itomaki tachi made for an Ikeda Daimyo in Christie&#39;s London. \n  Victor has seen this nagamaki and agrees that it is 16th c.\n\n  I think this weapon is the first of a number of identical contract pieces \n  for an armoury, as it is numbered &#39;1&#39; as are one seppa, the fuchi and the \n  tsuka in ink under the fuchi, it is utilitarian, with thin yamagane mounts \n  and low quality lacquer, the nakago-ana are not well made. The long ububa \n  can be accounted for by its lack of use, it may have been polished only once \n  or twice then stored for a very long time, this would account for its fairly \n  good condition apart from the leather tsuka binding shrinking and being \n  attacked by insects.\n\n  It may look like a sword but it has the thick saya of a polearm, no kurikata \n  and the tsuka is 21.5&quot; long.\n\n  As I stated in my earlier post it weighs around 6lbs, this is not something \n  one would want as a personal weapon, it is too heavy and awkward to carry \n  and I think would only be useful in battle. \n\n\n\n  \n\n--\nI am using the free version of SPAMfighter.\nWe are a community of 7 million users fighting spam.\nSPAMfighter has removed 9 of my spam emails to date.\nGet the free SPAMfighter here: http://www.spamfighter.com/len\n\nThe Professional version does not have this message\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
