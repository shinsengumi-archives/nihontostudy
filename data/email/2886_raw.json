Harris \n  To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Monday, April 25, 2005 10:58 AM\n  Subject: [nihontostudy] Han Bing Siong book now in stock\n\n\n  I am pleased to announce that &quot;Japanese Swords in Dutch Collections,&quot; the\n  2003 publication of the late Mr. Han Bing Siong by the Netherlands Token\n  Society, is now in stock.\n\n  Though I have over the years read and admired Mr. Han&#39;s articles in the\n  JSS/US Newsletter, English Token Bijitsu, and elsewhere, spending some time\n  with this book has overwhelmed me with the extent of his scholarship and the\n  magnitude of our loss with his recent passing. \n\n  As the former owner of a katana signed (gimei, of course!) Hankei, I read\n  with interest the first entry in the book, a wakizashi by Hankei. I felt\n  like I learned more from that two pages than I had in all the reading I had\n  done back when I owned that blade and dug up every article, oshigata, and\n  reference to Hankei that I could find. \n\n  This is the kind of book that makes me proud to be a bookseller.\n\n\n  SIONG, HAN BING. Japanese Swords in Dutch Collections A Selection from 500\n  Descriptions in the Series Japanse Zwaarden in Nederland Bezit. Rijswijk,\n  Netherlands: The Netherlands Token Society, 2003. First edition. 244 p.\n  Translated from the Dutch by J. M. Bonsel and M. Laros. This selection of\n  85 blades of the 500 cataloged by Han Bing Song since 1979 was published to\n  celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Netherlands Token Society. The\n  cataloging project included swords in museums as well as private\n  collections. Of those presented in this book, a range of swords from Koto\n  through Gendaito are shown with oshigata and Mr. Han&#39;s scholarly and\n  insightful comments.  Seventeen of the blades are also presented in\n  photographs, and there are 14 pages of full color photographs of the best of\n  the koshirae. An outstanding publication of the highest quality and most\n  valuable content. Pictorial Hardcover. As New.        $100.00\n\n  Shipping:\n  U.S. Media Mail (4-14 days)        $ 4.00\n  U.S. Priority Mail (2-4 days)      $12.00 \n  Canada Air Parcel Post (4-10 days) $18.00\n  Canada Global Priority (4-6 days)  $20.00\n\n  Rates for other destinations gladly quoted on request.\n\n  Visa, MasterCard, Discover, PayPal.
