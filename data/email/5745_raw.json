That at least is how I understand it.\n\nIt was also only after a certain time, like in the last 10 years that \nthey were in existence, or something like that.\n\nI have always been of the opinion that if it has a green paper, re \nsubmit it for a Hozon. Don&#39;t forget that new evidence on a smith or \nschool could have since come to light and or new thinking may be in \nplace and you may get a different result regardless if the paper is good \nor bad.\n\nCheers\n\nRich\n\nOn 14/09/2010 2:19 AM, Ron Hartmann wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Alan, you&#39;re not saying that all Tokubetsu Kicho papers are \n&gt; unacceptable, are you? My impression is that the NBTHK simply \n&gt; tightened the reins on what gets what paper. Like something mumei that \n&gt; was given the lowest level &quot;white&quot; paper would never be papered, today \n&gt; (because of a lack of quality). I&#39;m not sure where the next level \n&gt; (Tokubetsu Kicho) fits today but Koshu Tokubetsu Kicho would be like \n&gt; today&#39;s Hozon level and some earlier Juyo Token might only get \n&gt; Tokubetsu Hozon, today. Something like that.\n&gt;\n&gt; Ron\n&gt; STL\n&gt; ----- Original Message -----\n&gt; From: Alan Bale\n&gt; To: nihontostudy ; token_kenkyu_kai@... \n&gt; &lt;mailto:token_kenkyu_kai%40lists.umbc.edu&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Monday, September 13, 2010 1:00 PM\n&gt; Subject: Papers\n&gt;\n&gt; On the subject of papers collectors should be aware that one or two\n&gt; unscrupulus Japanese dealers have been entering blades with Tokubetsu\n&gt; Kicho papers into western auction houses, these blades having been refused\n&gt; by recent (Hozon etc) shinsa panels, some of these blades were by big\n&gt; names.
