I\n&gt; wish\n&gt; someone more experienced would step in and comment,\n&gt; as\n&gt; I don&#39;t think I am very qualified with less than 5\n&gt; years experience. Take my comments just as a\n&gt; beginning\n&gt; point and allow for the fact that others may feel I\n&gt; am\n&gt; absolutely wrong.\n&gt; \n&gt; The kissaki looks chu to ko-kissaki and front part\n&gt; tapers quickly. What is the length of the cutting\n&gt; edge? \n&gt;    Tobiyaki (if correct term) is associated with\n&gt; So-Den. My feeling off the sword is that it is\n&gt; Shinto\n&gt; and hastily shortened for WW2 mounts. Out of polish,\n&gt; unsigned, and just photos....very hard for me to\n&gt; tell.\n&gt;     I may be entirely misreading the blade, but am\n&gt; operating under the belief that few if any WWII\n&gt; smiths\n&gt; executed tobiyaki. I do not know which Shinto or\n&gt; Shinshinto schools did.\n&gt; \n&gt; Curran\n&gt; \n&gt; --- Verne Turpin &lt;ren47@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; I will add a couple of more photos showing the\n&gt; &gt; kissaki\n&gt; &gt; and whole blade.\n&gt; &gt; Thanks\n&gt; &gt; --- Curran Campbell &lt;neobliviscar@...&gt;\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Vern & Robert,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I figured someone would comment with more\n&gt; &gt; knowledge\n&gt; &gt; &gt; than me. But I&#39;ll try and further discussion on\n&gt; &gt; it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Those with more knowledge ___PLEASE___correct\n&gt; me.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Very -off the cuff- impression is it was later\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Shinto\n&gt; &gt; &gt; or Shinshinto shortened to fit WW II mounts.\n&gt; &gt; Little\n&gt; &gt; &gt; guess as to school. I have much to learn about\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ShinShinto.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   I don&#39;t know much either about WWII mounts, so\n&gt; &gt; not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; sure how much that would trim. Would move the\n&gt; &gt; machi\n&gt; &gt; &gt; up\n&gt; &gt; &gt; considerably and leave a bright nakago mune\n&gt; &gt; behind?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Does seem to my eye to have tobiyaki, so I\n&gt; thought\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that was a good sign.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;    I wondered about the geometry on the kissaki\n&gt; &gt; and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; would like to see the sugata/shape of the whole\n&gt; &gt; &gt; sword.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Curran\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- Robert Gilmore &lt;rgilmore82@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Does anyone have any comments on Verne&#39;s\n&gt; sword? \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Admittedly it is \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; difficult to see the hamon in his photos, but\n&gt; he\n&gt; &gt; &gt; is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; describing \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Tobiyaki.  Also, it is interesting to see how\n&gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; nakago mune is shiny \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; near the machi.  I haven&#39;t seen this before. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Would\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; this indicate a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; recent  machi repair, or a tight habaki that\n&gt; is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; burnishing the nakago?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Bob\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Verne wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Hello for Florida, Just joined and am fairly\n&gt; &gt; new\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; japanese sword \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;collecting. I have created an album under\n&gt; Verne\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; they are pics of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;a sword I just found at an antique shop.Would\n&gt; &gt; &gt; like\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; some opinons, not \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;signed. Could be a shorted katana bordering\n&gt; on\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; wakasashi length.
