As with Bungo Takada there are both very good ones and poor ones.  I personally like good Ko-Shoami work a lot.  \n\nYou&#39;re talking about the Yagyu guard with the dice game motif that went through while you were working the first day?  The quality of the iron and the work in the rim are the most important kantei points, so don&#39;t forget what you saw.  That shape is a distinctive Yagyu trait -- curved sides, almost straight top and bottom, sometimes with a &quot;bump&quot; in the middle.  Of course there are also plenty of round ones.  The design of dice and gaming chips is very unusual for Yagyu (or anyone else).  I&#39;m not sure what to make of it, made for a gambler? \n\nYes there is a Yagyu design book.  I have a photocopy of a hand-drawn copy, which was copied from another hand drawn copy.  This design is not in it, but I&#39;ve seen other Yagyu designs that do not appear in the book.  It&#39;s an interesting document, but not the final word on Yagyu (at least the copy I have, there may be other variations).  Yagyu is a very complicated topic.\n\nJim\n\n\n\n  thanks, Jim et al,\n\n  All kidding aside, there is nothing wrong with Shoami, right ?\n  Sort of like &quot; Bungo Takada swords &quot; of tsuba world ?\n\n  Question regarding the yagyu guard.............\n  Besides the quality of the iron + the &quot; masame like bones ? &quot; on the \n  mimi, why Yagyu ?  \n  To my untrained eyes, the design looks Shoami or certainly not the \n  usual waves based design that&#39;s typical of that school.\n  Is that particular design listed in the Yagyu design book ?  An old \n  timer told me there&#39;s such a book.  True ?\n\n  Again, thanks, it was fun making copies........just like that \n  character in Saturday Live.\n\n\n  milt\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
