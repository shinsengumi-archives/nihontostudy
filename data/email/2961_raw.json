I was \njust wondering if it is the same in regards to the Swords.  I work with \nGreek (earlier times and Imperial), Roman (Republican, Provincial, \nImperial) and Byzantine cup coins.  Most what we are having to deal with \nis Bronze, but we do get Silver or Silvered coins and some copper.\n\nKim\n\nRichard Turner wrote:\n\n&gt;Hi Kim, I don&#39;t think anyone will answer that, an inherently dangerous \n&gt;question that could only lead to tears. You will be told 99.9% of the \n&gt;time, it is best left to the experts.\n&gt;\n&gt;So the answer would be, We DON&#39;T repatinate parts of our swords, we send \n&gt;them to polishers and they do it.\n&gt;\n&gt;cheers\n&gt;\n&gt;Rich Turner\n&gt;\n&gt;Kim Ghobrial wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Hi All,\n&gt;&gt;No one responded to my questions.  Can someone please tell me how you\n&gt;&gt;guys repatinate your parts of the swords?  Also, what is recipe for\n&gt;&gt;doing it?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Sincerely,\n&gt;&gt;Kim\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;Yahoo!
