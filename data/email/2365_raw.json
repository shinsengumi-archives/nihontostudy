He \nmainly sells polished and papered swords.  He is a good guy and a straight \nshooter.  I recommend him.  I have not been disappointed in the swords I \nhave bought from him.  Hope that helps, Mike\n\n\n&gt;From: &quot;Allan Schrattenholz&quot; &lt;apschrattenholz@...&gt;\n&gt;Reply-To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;Subject: [nihontostudy] Tokugawa Daisho\n&gt;Date: Wed, 27 Oct 2004 13:41:42 -0000\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Hi all.\n&gt;I had the opportunity to buy this in the spring 2004 from 2 private\n&gt;collectors ( former ). I bought the Daisho set first and then the\n&gt;owner had seen it on the net and then provided the tanto for sale. I\n&gt;believe that it is great that all 3 pieces are together now. Maybe\n&gt;that they some day may come back to The Tokugawa Museum ? Have been\n&gt;looking at many websites and hae besides NihontoAntiques, as I\n&gt;received very good recommendation about, - thankyou, also seen www.\n&gt;artswords.com owned by Bill Rannow who have many fine things on his\n&gt;site, swords as well as fittings. Does anybody know him or have\n&gt;bought something from him. It looks very good to me?.\n&gt;Regarding the Tokugawa, I need a little help to translate the\n&gt;correct mei on the shoto which I translate as Kunifusa.\n&gt;Unfortunately I can not differ from Hawleys Kun 34 - 39. I have\n&gt;tried to take some good photos of the mei but have not succeeded yet\n&gt;and will return for help when I have some good photos.\n&gt;I learn a lot from all off you so please continue the lessons,\n&gt;thankyou.\n&gt;All the best\n&gt;Allan\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nExpress yourself instantly with MSN Messenger!
