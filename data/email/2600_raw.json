It allowed me to get a message sent to\n&gt; the warehouse manager that started the search that immediately turned up\n&gt; the sword.\n&gt; \n&gt; This identical problem happened to me one year ago in Montreal, with the\n&gt; same situation... someone removed a sword from the stream, scanned that\n&gt; it was sent to Customs, then it was put aside in someone&#39;s office where\n&gt; at the end of three weeks of phone calls and searching it was later\n&gt; &quot;found&quot; 15 minutes after I said I was sending the police.\n&gt; \n&gt; Needless to say it is Fedex only for me here on in, and I could myself\n&gt; lucky to have gotten both pieces back.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks go to a lot of you who sent me supportive notes. I was pretty\n&gt; deep in despair there due to the value and importance of the\n&gt; piece. Those notes helped me make it through, so thanks.\n&gt; \n&gt; - darcy\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo!
