Most Onin and many earlier Heianjo =\r\nguards do have a &quot;sandy&quot; surface texture to the iron.  Some Kamakura-bori a=\r\nnd Yagyu guards (Edo period, btw) do as well, although the appearance is a =\r\nbit different.  I don&#39;t know what causes that surface texture.  Most Muroma=\r\nchi period iron guards that are believed to be made from sand iron do not h=\r\nave that sandy texture. \n\nOne modern Japanese swordsmith who makes ko-tosho=\r\n and ko-katchushi style tsuba on occasion told me that he uses tamahagane o=\r\nr ordinary modern iron in his tsuba, and that while there is a difference i=\r\nn the way that the iron &quot;works&quot; he doesn&#39;t see any outwardly visible differ=\r\nence in the final product.  I&#39;m not clear on whether he used an orishigane-=\r\ntype process on the modern iron or just forged it as-is.\n\nEdo period iron g=\r\nuards tend to have a more homogeneous look to the iron than their &quot;koto&quot; co=\r\nunterparts.  I don&#39;t know how much of this comes from the source of the ore=\r\n, the way it was smelted or how it was subsequently forged.  I think that t=\r\nhere probably is some technical analogy with the appearance and technology =\r\nof koto and shinto blades.\n\nSome modern swordsmiths recycle old-tech iron h=\r\ninges and nails into their work.  My guess is that old smiths probably also=\r\n recycled older iron, although maybe more for cost than aesthetic reasons. =\r\n It&#39;s far from clear what causes the unique differences of appearance of th=\r\ne iron of the major Muromachi period tsuba groups.\n\nJim\n\n\n\n  All, I am look=\r\ning at a Heianj=C3=B4 guard here, one that has been called late \n  Muromach=\r\ni by some and maybe Edo by others. I am curious, did all the \n  older schoo=\r\nls such as Heianj=C3=B4 use sand iron exclusively or did they mix \n  it up =\r\nand if they did use sand iron, is it discernible by anything. My \n  guard h=\r\nas small particles on the surface, which I assume is what sand \n  would loo=\r\nk like in the hira.\n\n  Also, is sand iron something peculiar to the older t=\r\nimes or was is use \n  in the later periods as well. From what I have read, =\r\nit seems to be a \n  trait of the Koto times.\n\n  Cheers all\n\n  Rich Turner\n\n=\r\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
