I got to see one of those Hong Kong Crappers up close and personal. I had a new acquaintance make a 5 hour drive up from the southern part of the state today to meet and greet and share his new sword with me. A young man in his late teens. He was lucky in the sense that he didn&#39;t pay for this sword, it was a gift, but someone bought it for him, mores the pity for them. \nIt was decked out in what appeared to be standard gunto mount&#39;s that turned out to be very poorly made indeed. The blade really isn&#39;t worthy of mention, very poorly acid etched hamon, cheap old iron that had been ground into shape. The mei looked like it was scratched out with a nail or something. It was so badly made I couldn&#39;t believe it. Still, he hangs it on his wall and enjoys it for what it is at the moment. \n\nHe want&#39;s to come to one of the local auctions later in the year. I didn&#39;t have anything to show him as we met at my office but I said when he sees something that is properly made he will understand more, for now his cheap and nasty HKC can hang on his wall and he can dream of betters things ahead. \n\nMaybe with luck, in a few month&#39;s time we will have another convert in our midst. \n\ncheers all \n\nRich T\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
