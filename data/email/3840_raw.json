Usually k=\r\nodogu is just displayed for study.  We did tsuba kantei a couple of times i=\r\nn the NY club.  I made a small wooden clamp that would cover up the seppa d=\r\nai but still allow the tsuba to be picked up.  I haven&#39;t seen it done elsew=\r\nhere.  Doing kantei kai of mumei items is a little problematic since the &quot;r=\r\night&quot; answer is still an opinion rather than a fact.\n&gt;\n&gt; Doing it online ha=\r\ns the handicap of not being able to see everything about the piece, but of =\r\ncourse that&#39;s true too of paper kantei contests for swords.  It could be do=\r\nne if someone has the time.  It&#39;d be easy enough to Photoshop out signature=\r\ns.\n&gt;\n&gt; Jim\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   Greeting&#39;s all. I guess this question may be directed =\r\nto Jim more than\n&gt;   anyone else, but I am sure others will be more than ke=\r\nen to jump in if\n&gt;   they feel so inclined.\n&gt;\n&gt;   Are there ever any or man=\r\ny Tsuba or Tosogu Kantei ? I am sure there are\n&gt;   at group/club meetings a=\r\nnd such but I was thinking more in line with the\n&gt;   Nihonto Kantei the NTH=\r\nK offer in their monthly or Kenji Mishina offers\n&gt;   on-line.\n&gt;\n&gt;   The rec=\r\nent post&#39;s in regards to David and Curran&#39;s guards, with the\n&gt;   answers th=\r\nat ensued, got me thinking it would be great to see maybe 1/2\n&gt;   a dozen t=\r\nsuba offered up each month for kantei. I guess the usual\n&gt;   aspects of kan=\r\ntei would remain the same, i.e. style, type of work, size,\n&gt;   thickness, t=\r\nekkotsu if there and either an image with the mei ( if\n&gt;   applicable ) hid=\r\nden or some sort.\n&gt;\n&gt;   Just a thought, sounds like fun to me :-)\n&gt;\n&gt;   any=\r\n thought&#39;s on this ?\n&gt;\n&gt;   Cheers\n&gt;\n&gt;   Rich.\n&gt;\n&gt; [Non-text portions of thi=\r\ns message have been removed]\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt; Yahoo!
