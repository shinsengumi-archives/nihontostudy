They actually are sometimes quite thick (around 1\ncm), but it would seem that any effect on the balance of those swords would\nhave been negligable.\nJim\n\n\n\n&gt; What about the use of the tsuba for balancing the sword ? Doesn&#39;t that\n&gt; play an important role as well ?\n&gt;\n&gt; I read in a piece by R. B. Caldwell that since the kamakura tachis were\n&gt; so well balanced by themselves (he described them as prima donnas haha)\n&gt;\n&gt; they really only needed a light lacquered leather guard.\n&gt;\n&gt; So it stands to reason that the Nambokucho massive swords that had\n&gt; little fumbari were no where near as well balanced and must have needed\n&gt; massive tsuba to match ??\n&gt;\n&gt; Or small ones that were 2.5 inches wide and 1 inch thick of course\n&gt; hahaha\n&gt;\n&gt; - Matt\n\n\n"
