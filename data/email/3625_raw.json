I could have sworn it was only\n&gt; friday!\n&gt; You&#39;re telling me you know of contacts in Canada for study and collection?\n&gt; Well Merry Christmas to me!  LOL\n&gt; I live in New Brunswick on the east coast. Occasionally I&#39;ll make it out\n&gt; west to do some mountain climbing and I&#39;ve been down to New Hampshire, \n&gt; Mount\n&gt; Washington. Apart from that, I usually don&#39;t get state side. I can just \n&gt; see\n&gt; myself trying to explain to a customs officer that I&#39;m travelling to the\n&gt; U.S. to attend a Japanese Sword Show! LOL! I&#39;m going to need a passport \n&gt; next\n&gt; year just to cross the border into Maine so I can buy cheap milk!\n&gt; Where abouts  are you located John?\n&gt; Any information you can provide me with would be greatly appreciated. If\n&gt; anyone out there in Nihonto land wants to come to New Brunswick and share\n&gt; their knowledge, I will supply Beer and Lobsters.\n&gt; Now if there&#39;s going to be more than 10 of you or any international\n&gt; arrivals, (Andres), I will need some time to plan.\n&gt; Have a great holiday season everyone.

Most are $200 range, more or less. If you are new at this I\n&gt; would be happy to recommend good ones that would help teach you about \n&gt; these\n&gt; things. Some of these have been to a number of shows and are now kept home\n&gt; so that I can keep my table at the shows, fresh. All are authentic, for\n&gt; sure. The shows seem to have a wonderful selection of nice quality tsuba\n&gt; these days and that is good for the buyer, bad for the seller since there \n&gt; is\n&gt; such a &quot;selection&quot; to pick from. Anyway...just thought I&#39;d toss this idea\n&gt; out to you. I&#39;ve been around for going on 40 years...gosh, that&#39;s a little\n&gt; frightening to put in writing!\n&gt;\n&gt; Ron\n&gt; STL\n&gt; ----- Original Message -----\n&gt; From: anwahi\n&gt; To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Sent: Wednesday, December 21, 2005 4:23 PM\n&gt; Subject: [nihontostudy] Where do you buy your Tsuba?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Hello,\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m new here and to collecting Tsuba. Where do you buy your Tsuba from?\n&gt; I know there&#39;s several websites you can find with a Google search, an\n&gt; occasional Token Kai show like the one in SF, or Ebay (most look like\n&gt; junk). I&#39;m looking for good sources of authentic Tsuba. Obviously the\n&gt; only way to be really sure of authenticity is to purchase papered\n&gt; Tsuba, but because I&#39;m starting off I want some sources of authentic\n&gt; Tsuba more reasonably priced. Any suggestions?\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks for your helpo in advance,\n&gt; Anthony\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; --\n&gt; YAHOO!
