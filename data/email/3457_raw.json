I think that was mentioned in the\nnihonto newsletters.  I can&#39;t wait to read the\narticle, one of my favorite schools and quite\npossibley my future area of concentration, if I can\never afford to buy another sword or I win the lottery.\nKen\n\n--- Ron Hartmann &lt;swords@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; Hi Mediator san - \n&gt; \n&gt; Well, it&#39;s good to know people are still alive out\n&gt; there. I started to wonder if I missed something on\n&gt; the news that caused a melt-down of the sword groups\n&gt; or something. Hmmm...let&#39;s see what I can toss out\n&gt; there to talk about. \n&gt; \n&gt; Anyone ever studied the &quot;dating&quot; of Bingo Mihara\n&gt; swords using the full &quot;Bingo&quot; province name v/s the\n&gt; abreviated form of &quot;Bishu?&quot; I recall this being\n&gt; mentioned in NBTHK&#39;s Token Bijutsu a decade or so\n&gt; ago. One reason I ask is that I&#39;m (eventually) going\n&gt; to write something for the JSS/US on a couple Bingo\n&gt; Mihara swords. \n&gt; \n&gt; Ron\n&gt; STL\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt;   From: Andres Pedraza \n&gt;   To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n&gt;   Sent: Wednesday, November 09, 2005 5:51 PM\n&gt;   Subject: Re: [nihontostudy] Testing...no reply\n&gt; necessary\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   We are all meditating.
