I wish I had seen Choshu-ya&#39;s koshirae, but I&#39;d like to have seen a complete example of the older one even more.  But, I stayed home instead.\n\nBTW, I got a copy from Ian on the yahoo nihonto list of your public mention of the kenkyu-in thing there.  Thanks for the recognition.  I have a lot of work to do.\n\nJim\n\n\n\n  Hi Jim,\n\n\n\n  There is one at Choshu-ya. It was out on display last weekend. It is very\n  similar to the first one listed below except that the kozuka and kogai are\n  intact. Absolutely killer. I wonder why the Tegai Kanenaga inside is not\n  shown? Or is that a stupid question?\n\n\n\n  Gordon\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
