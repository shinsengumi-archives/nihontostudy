The signature reads =93Sanjo Mune=\r\nchika saku.=94\nFrom the quality of the mounts and etc., I am pretty confide=\r\nnt that you have\na sword manufactured for the export market, typically in K=\r\nuwana or some\nother local area, and then sent to Yokohama to provide an ine=\r\nxpensive, but\nvery exotic souvenir for some clipper ship crewman and etc. F=\r\nrom an artistic\nand historical level, such swords are not very important. N=\r\nonetheless, they\nmake nice wall hangers. For the veterans, everyone knows w=\r\nho Sanjo Munechika\nis, so there is no need to explain more, but for the new=\r\nbies, most of these\nexport swords have the names =96 not signatures =96 of =\r\nbig named smiths. Sanjo\nMunechika is a Heian period smith who is basically =\r\nthe founder of the\nYamashiro tradition. This use of big names is sort of li=\r\nke a street artist\nsigning his chalk rendered Rembrandts with Rembrandt=92s=\r\n name. No one would\nmistake this for Munechika=92s work, it just adds a bit=\r\n of interest.\n\n \n\nGordon\n\n \n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: nihontostudy@=\r\nyahoogroups.com [mailto:nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com] On\nBehalf Of bh325\nSe=\r\nnt: Saturday, October 14, 2006 12:30 PM\nTo: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com\nSu=\r\nbject: [nihontostudy] Re: O-Tanto?\n\n \n\nCurran,\n\nThank you for your reply.
