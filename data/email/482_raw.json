There seems to be a partially hammered and raised mimi on the bottom that disappears further up the plate.\n\n  I think you could help it a lot by giving it a &quot;once over&quot; with some mild liquid soap and a soft toothbrush.\n\n  John\n    ----- Original Message ----- \n    From: David Zincavage \n    To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n    Sent: Thursday, July 03, 2003 9:21 AM\n    Subject: Re: [nihontostudy] tsuba questions\n\n\n    John,\n\n    If you click on:\n\n    http://zincavage.org/BlueOni.jpg\n\n    and allow time for a largish file to load, you can see a less flattering, more detailed scan.

It may be an original Nara piece done in a more subtle style or a later Nara school work.  \n\n      From your pictures it is very difficult to tell the color or quality of the iron plate which is the determining factor in iron tsuba and its quality.\n\n      The flower and other work seem to be of the Nara school work even if they are hard to see. I would think if someone would go to the trouble to make a copy of a Nara tsuba they would make it a little more flamboyant or copy one of the Nara masters.\n\n      John\n        ----- Original Message ----- \n        From: David Zincavage \n        To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n        Sent: Wednesday, July 02, 2003 10:14 PM\n        Subject: Re: [nihontostudy] tsuba questions\n\n\n        Thank you for trying.  Clearly the photos were not very successful in conveying the piece to anyone.\n          ----- Original Message ----- \n          From: Jim Gilbert \n          To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n          Sent: Wednesday, July 02, 2003 9:06 PM\n          Subject: Re: [nihontostudy] tsuba questions\n\n\n          David,\n          I think that the surface of the guard was made more or less as you see it.  I don&#39;t think that it is so old or worn down.  It is done in Nara style, but is probably later shiiremono given the quality of the plate and inlay.  I don&#39;t see oni horns on the front... they look more like the tops of pagoda done in Kaneie-style landscape.  The &quot;blossoms&quot; are probably just the usual depiction of pine needle whorls.  But, you have the plate in hand and photos are difficult to work with.\n\n          Jim\n\n\n            http://zincavage.org/OniandSnail.html\n\n\n            I just bought a tsuba which is quite old and much worn down.  On the first\n            side, it has an oni sitting happily beneath a flowering tree by the light of\n            a full moon, while below him a snail crawls by. Moon, blossoms, and the\n            oni&#39;s horns are gold.  On the reverse, the oni is disappearing away from us,\n            as the snail crosses the bottom in his direction.\n\n            Are tsubas this worn considered to be severely diminished in value?\n\n            Is anyone acquainted with a Japanese oni-and-snail story?\n\n\n\n\n\n          [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n                Yahoo!
