I had made a suggestion that\nthe JSS/US could make a deal with one of these\nservices for cheaper rates/caps for the membership.  I\nassume that won&#39;t happen though.\n\nRates are similiar some 10%, 12%, some have\nprotection, some only charge 500 yen for shipping (or\nactual cost if higher), each is a little different so\nyou have to look at them all and how they operate to\ntruly compare.  The 8% seems to be the lowest.\n\nYou also have to understand that banks in japan charge\nhigh fees and don&#39;t have free checking like in the US.\n \n\nI agree expensive at times, but likely cheaper than\ngetting it here in the US and/or no availibility here\nin the US.\n\nKen aka Mantis dude\n\n--- MuramasaIII@... wrote:\n\n&gt; I think checking items &quot; through &quot; their site you\n&gt; get free  \n&gt; translation..........at least that&#39;s what I get with\n&gt; that girlie photo  auction.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Milt\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been\n&gt; removed]\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?
