I k=\r\nnow Yoshindo Yoshihara sensei \ndoes apparently, and I would love to see som=\r\ne examples of his work. I \nwas thinking about this recently, and wondered a=\r\nbout the recipes in the \nback of the Aesthetic Guide and if anyone still do=\r\nes this stuff. If so, \ncould very good tsuba with minimal damage be repaire=\r\nd and re patinate \nand if so, how effectively.\n\nRight then, foot back in my=\r\n mouth and over to the experts.\n\ncheers\n\nRich Turner\n\n\n-- \n\nRichard Turner\n=\r\nNihont=F4 Message Board\n&lt;http://members5.boardhost.com/Nihon-To/&gt;\n- /for th=\r\ne discussion and sharing of all things Nihont=F4/\n\n \n\n\n\n[Non-text portions =\r\nof this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
