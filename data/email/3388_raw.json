I was looking at a Bizen Suruga tsuba and reading up \non =\r\nthe school in comparison to Bizen Shoami when it occured to me that \nthe pl=\r\nacement of the kuchi beni (sekigane) by the tsubako as part of \nthe design =\r\nmay have been a purposeful endeavor to reduce wear to the \nnakago or possib=\r\nle shock-related fracture to the tsuba as well as for \nthe fitting of the b=\r\nlade.  It just hit me that the use of a more \nplastic metal would result in=\r\n a two-fold benefit of helping to prevent \nthese named problems and also in=\r\n fascilitating the fitting and later \ntightening of the tsuba to it&#39;s sword=\r\n.  That this practice occured in \nBizen could make sense in that they had a=\r\n long history of sword \nmanufacture and when the Haruta family moved to Biz=\r\nen and began tsuba \nfabrication (Tsuba An Aesthetic Study pg. 31)they looke=\r\nd for advice \nfrom the local smiths and began placement of the copper shims=\r\n on their \nobservations/advice.  Just a bit of conjecture but as I have see=\r\nn \nswords with considerable wear to the nakago from ill-fitting \n(assumptio=\r\nn) tsuba it may be a plausible assumption.  The placement at \nthe top and b=\r\nottom would also seem to make sense as the primary axis of \nshock-force del=\r\nivery would occur on this plane from strike/rebound \nenergy and would help =\r\nexplain why circumfirential placement was not \nutilized.  Interesting.\n\n\n\n\n"
