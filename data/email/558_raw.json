I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve seen nunome on Tibetan guards either, but I can&#39;t claim to have looked at many.  Are they typically multi-plate construction?\n\nIt&#39;s at: http://pictures.care2.com/view/1/743171541  photo&#39;s 1 & 2.\n\nCome to think of it I&#39;ve seen Chinese guards with a square-profile cup shape.  I don&#39;t think that they had a Japanese-shaped nakago ana or marks from seppa wear, though.\n\nThe rectangular pattern on the seppa dai and the style of nunome on the rim seem like typical Hizen traits.  Of course they were working with foreign styles.\n\nJim\n\n\n\n\n  I looked at this guard when it was first mentioned. At that time, it seemed\n  very much like the dished guards seen on Tibetan swords, altho the nunome\n  zogan struck me as problematical. Could some please post the URL, I&#39;d like\n  to take another look.
