It is my album Ron STL under Yahoo photos. It is also an album: (sworddad) 2004 5/15 in another Yahoo photos album. (I&#39;m still confused as to why I&#39;m under two locations.) \n\nThe mei shown is on what appears an early tanto, 25.2 cm, about 1-1.5 mm uchizori, mitsumune. At first I blew-off the mei as gimei to: Rai Kunitoshi or Kuniyuki. However, the tanto does seem to fit the era of Rai work. Looking at it again today I&#39;m starting to wonder if this might be something totally different. The third character could very easily be accepted at &quot;saku&quot; which would then mean that the first character I&#39;m calling &quot;Rai&quot; might be something else similar in form to &quot;Rai.&quot; There definitely is a horizontal stroke at the ana. You can see just the end of it to the left of the hole. One similar character I found in O&#39;Neil is #343 (radical 119) which could be read Yone, bei, mai, kome, mitsu...but I can not come up with any smith using this first character in his name. Perhaps I&#39;m groping here, wishful thinking that it is not a gimei Rai-something, but maybe one of you guys with a command of the language will know something I do not know. (Wouldn&#39;t take much!) \n\nAnyway, see if this link works or, just go to the Yahoo photos and look for my album. \n\n  http://tinyurl.com/34jbo\n\nThanks!\n\nRon\nSTL\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
