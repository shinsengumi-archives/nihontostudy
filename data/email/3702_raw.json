It is a=\r\nll in Japanese but the \n  images are clear. They covered ( in the magazines=\r\n ) Nobuiye and Kaneiye.\n\n  If you like, I can scan them up and PDF them you=\r\n you. Not sure if they \n  will help.\n\n  Rich\n\n  Jim Gilbert wrote:\n\n  &gt;Pete=\r\n,\n  &gt;I can&#39;t think of anything in English better than the Tsuba Geijutsu-Ko=\r\n by Toigoye and Haynes.  I&#39;m sure that there is further commentary in Joly&#39;=\r\ns translations of Akiyama republished in the NCJSC newsletters some years a=\r\ngo, but I don&#39;t have them organized or indexed.\n  &gt;\n  &gt;Nobuie Tsuba by Naka=\r\nmura is as good a picture sources as any, at least for having large numbers=\r\n of examples to compare.  Each mei is attributed to a type in the text of t=\r\nhe oshigata section.
