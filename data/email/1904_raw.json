It is very unplesant to admi=\r\nt that you have been cheeted like this. In these kind of matters, i.e. inte=\r\nrnercriminality, the police work very slowly. The case has just reached the=\r\n USA Police. Too late to interfere and investigate the current episode on e=\r\nbay where the auction were planned to close on th 19th. of May. I actually =\r\nbought the sword and payed 3980 US dollars for it, but never received it. T=\r\nherefore it belongs to me unless someone has bought it before I did.  Norma=\r\nlly I am very carefully to get enough documentation for peobles identity be=\r\nfore trading. Assumenly passport, driverslicense and NBTHK papers as well a=\r\ns a lot of photos were not enough. Furthermore I don=B4t know whether someo=\r\nne else might have bought this beatyful sword before the date I bought it? =\r\nNaturally I would prefer to get the sword but have realized that it might b=\r\ne very difficult and that matters the money as well. But the sword are uniq=\r\nue, as all japanese swords are. In addition it has NBTHK paers and in my op=\r\ninion it should not be impossible to find a former or maybe the current own=\r\ner, if it is not me. Anyway I am happy to have prevented another one being =\r\ncheeted and for the support from the group where you not have heard from me=\r\n yet. IAs I mentioned I have photos of the sword and copy of the NBTHK  pap=\r\ners and if anyone interested and if it does not interfere with the policy o=\r\nf this group, I can publish it. My plan is to get in contact with worldwide=\r\n clubs and NBTHK as well and ask peoble if they know anything about this sp=\r\necific sword. To you John, I am most happy that you stopped the payment in =\r\ntime. I have noticed that the seller has stopped the auction as well. I wou=\r\nld appreciate so much if you could mail a copy of what you have of any corr=\r\nespondance or photos. Off course not any private informations. Then I will =\r\nadd this further information to the police.\nThankyou for your support.\nAll =\r\nthe best\nAllan\n\nWhen I have come through this awful case I will join the li=\r\nst more. I have some intersting swords and tsubas as well. I always enjoy a=\r\nnd learn from the discussion on this group.\n  ----- Original Message ----- =\r\n\n  From: John Berta \n  To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Tuesday, M=\r\nay 18, 2004 4:56 PM\n  Subject: Re: [nihontostudy] Bying on ebay.

I bought this sword the 21t=\r\nh. of february 2004, \n    payed it but never received it. By request I rece=\r\nived several other \n    photos of the sword and the NBTHK papers as well as=\r\n copies from his \n    passport and driverslicense. This information is avai=\r\nble for the \n    list if you don=B4t find it inconvenient. Look well at thi=\r\ns sword on \n    ebay and take care of wolflady 137 and jnetweb as well as J=\r\nohn \n    Pivec, Minneapolis, USA. This sword will without any doubt be put =\r\n\n    for sale again. If anyone has this sword in their possession, please \n=\r\n    let me know. I will award informations which will place the sword at \n =\r\n   my house with 1000 U.S.dollars. If the Nihonto study group find it \n    =\r\nappropiate I will put photos of the sword as well as John Pivecs \n    passp=\r\nort and driverslicense, on the list. \n    The Danish Criminal Police, The D=\r\nanish Foreign Ministry and the USA \n    Police are involved in the investig=\r\nation and I have asked ebay to \n    help with information as well.\n    Than=\r\nkyou for your help in advance\n    All the best\n    Allan\n\n\n          Yahoo!=\r\n Groups Sponsor \n                ADVERTISEMENT\n               \n         \n  =\r\n       \n\n\n  ---------------------------------------------------------------=\r\n---------------\n    Yahoo!
