I am sending this message=\r\n in the hopes that kenshi and sword\n&gt; &gt; collectors who frequent pawn shops =\r\nand sword shows may be able to\n&gt; &gt; help.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The sword at the time it w=\r\nas stolen (mid September 2008) was in an\n&gt; &gt; unfinished wood colored restin=\r\ng scabbard (aka oil scabbard,  \n&gt; shirasaya,\n&gt; &gt; etc). It had no tsuba and =\r\nthe handle did not close flush with the\n&gt; &gt; scabbard\n&gt; &gt; (there was a small=\r\n gap). The sword felt short, for someone who\n&gt; &gt; normally\n&gt; &gt; uses a 2.45 s=\r\nhaku blade and it was farely straight. The signature\n&gt; &gt; on the\n&gt; &gt; tang is=\r\n &quot;Kashi Fijihara Yukimitsu&quot;. It is thought to be about 300\n&gt; &gt; years\n&gt; &gt; ol=\r\nd. The sword was stollen in Eugene Oregon, though I believe that\n&gt; &gt; it may=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; show up anywhere along the west coast (especially Portland,\n&gt; &gt; Seattl=\r\ne, LA, or\n&gt; &gt; the bay area) or further.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; A rubbing of the blade&#39;s ta=\r\nng has been attached.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; If any one finds my sword please contact me a=\r\nt (206)-226-0561 or at\n&gt; &gt; chris.takahashi@....
