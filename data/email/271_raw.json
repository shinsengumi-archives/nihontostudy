Please take a look at the photos on the group site at:\n\n  http://tinyurl.com/cfw7\n\n  Real Japanese wisteria grow with the flower clusters hanging downward... see photo of an actual wisteria currently blooming in my yard.  Some fittings depict this plant in a naturalistic way as in the example of the Momoyama period Ko-Kinko o-kozuka.  This motif has also been stylized in mon with double strands of flowers either hanging down or pointing upward (which as far as I know they don&#39;t do in nature).  I have only run across single strand fuji mon with the flowers &quot;hanging&quot; up as illustrated in the mon photo.\n\n  Questions:\n  Does anyone have an example of a single strand wisteria mon with the flower cluster hanging down in the naturalistic way?\n\n  Does anyone know if there is some particular significance to the &quot;upside down&quot; versions of the mon?\n\n  Which orientation of the tsuba makes sense to you?  Is it depicting the actual plant (katana orientation) or the single strand mon (which would require a tachi orientation)?\n\n  Any ideas appreciated,\n  Jim\n\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n        Yahoo!
