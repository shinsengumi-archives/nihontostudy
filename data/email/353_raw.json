A mate and I were talkin swod tok the\nother night and we were discussing tanto. He mentioned and sent pics of\na very small blade that measures app 22cm in total length. As it turns\nout, I have one almost identical in size. Mine, as is his is also quite\nthick, both about 7 or 8 mm at the munemachi, very much like a\nyorio-doshi only far too short.\n\nPaul mentioned that he was told his was made as a gift for the wife of a\nsamurai as a wedding present. He believes his to be mid/late edo and\ntraditionally made. MIne is out of polish and hard to see hada or hamon,\nnie, nioi etc.. but the rest of it looks pretty similar.\n\nhere is a link to the two tanto Tantos &lt;www.whiz.com.au/richard/tantos.jpg&gt;\n\nI believe blades were common gifts for samurai wife&#39;s and I would expect\nthem to be smaller than usual but 22 cm is pretty small and more like a\nchild&#39;s size, though I guess weilded properly, could inflict just as\nmuch damage as a 30cm tanto.\n\nlooking forward to all opinions.\n\ncheers\n\nRich\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
