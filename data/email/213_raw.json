And of\ncourse the sword shows themselves have not-for-sale displays of swords and\nfittings and the occasional lecture.\n\nI found the comments about Japanese experts and foreign students in the\nfirst half of the article more provocative.  Again, I have a more positive\noutlook, but I&#39;d like to hear some comments from the guys with long term\nexperience in Japan.\n\nJim\n-------------\nHi all -\n\nWith the arrival of the latest NCJSC newsletter, To-Ron, the first thing\nthat caught my eye was an article written by Bob Haynes titled &quot;The\nConscience of the Collector.&quot; At first I was not sure where Bob was going\nwith his article but reading it, I found it quite &quot;thought provoking and\nwondered if others also found it so.\n\nBasically, if I understand it correctly, the article points up the need for\nmore serious kodogu study outside of Japan and the importance of thinking\n&quot;outside the box&quot;--traditional &quot;Japanese thinking&quot;--when it comes to sword\nstudy. \n\nI found it interesting to read Bob&#39;s comments regarding the intended goal of\nthe JSS/US when it was formed back in the late &#39;50s and also how today&#39;s\nworld of collecting outside of Japan takes on primarily a &quot;buy and sell&quot;\natmospher, that nobody puts on an exhibit purely for study as was done a few\ntimes in the past.  \n\nNot going anywhere with this other than to say I found the article very\ninteresting and though provoking.  Food for thought?  Just wondered in\nanyone else found it so.\n\nRon\nSTL\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\nYahoo!
