I want to start \nout with Koto, mainly so I can get a better grip on understanding \nconstruction and the ability to identify period and smith. I plan on \njoining a few clubs within the following months. Unfortuately, none \nare really close enough to attend regularly, with the exception of \nthe one in LA. \nI am going to miss the San Fran show, but will make Chicago, and I am \nrelly looking forward to it.\n\nThanks\nAlex\n\n--- In nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com, Richard Turner &lt;ikkanshi@w...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; HI Alex, do you want to collect anything in particular or \neverything \n&gt; Nihonto related. You didn&#39;&#39;t really say. Rich Stein has a great web \nsite \n&gt; full of Info http://www.geocities.com/alchemyst/nihonto.htm\n&gt; \n&gt; The sword shows are great, so are the club&#39;s. I recommend the \nNorthern \n&gt; Californian Japanese sword Club.\n&gt; \n&gt; http://www.ncjsc.org/ncjsc_library.htm\n&gt; \n&gt; welcome to the Club.\n&gt; \n&gt; Rich Turner\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; alnsash wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Hello all!\n&gt; &gt; I am new to collecting, but have been interested ever since I was\n&gt; &gt; little. I have picked up several books (and yes, read them) and \ncame\n&gt; &gt; to the realization that the only way to start expanding my\n&gt; &gt; understanding from this point is to start making some purchases. \nThe\n&gt; &gt; question I pose to all here is this:\n&gt; &gt; Is there any one thing that a new collector should look for above \nall\n&gt; &gt; else when making a buy?\n&gt; &gt; Now, I know this is a very generalized question, but I need to \nstart\n&gt; &gt; somewhere.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Thanks all!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Alex Bivin\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; BTW - Would like to thank Mr. Stein for his excellent website!
