Of course Hizen, and Nagasaki in particular, was the major point of contact with foreigners and their goods.  Guards made in Europe or China would have been seen first in Hizen.  A lot of the foreign-influenced styles of &quot;nanban tsuba&quot; were probably initially made in Hizen.  The &quot;dragon and vines&quot; type is so numerous that it was probably mass produced in other parts of Japan.\n\nI&#39;m sure that you can find exceptions in the usage, but most of the time the term Hizen is used for solid plate, iron guards with profuse, showy silver or multi-color nunome.  The motifs are often foreign-influenced, the plates are sometimes cupped like European guards, and they do share some decorative traits with the &quot;dragon and vines&quot; type like dragon motifs and a rectangular seppa dai (although in the case of the Hizen tsuba, it&#39;s usually just outlined with nunome).  I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever seen the dragon and vines type called Hizen.\n\nThere seems to be some consensus that the earliest nanban tsuba from the late 16th to early 17th C were made outside of Japan.  I think that is what Graham is talking about and they are rather rare.  The huge majority of pieces that we see in &quot;dragon in vines&quot; style are later and made in Japan.\n\nForeign influence found its way into arts beyond tsuba.  There were various nanban-style wares made in Japan, lacquer chests and furnishings (even nanban saya), clothing, painting, etc.  The nanban items made in Japan must far outnumber the imported ones that inspired them.\n\nJim\n\n\n\n  Gang, going off topic a little, but still on the Graham Gemmel Book, at\n  one point he discusses a nanban type tsuba with the very busy &#39;dragon in\n  vines&#39; type of decoration that is associated with &#39;Canton&#39; style. \n\n  He reckons that these tsuba were actually made in China and India, where\n  they were ordered by the Dutch who then sold them in Japan! \n\n  He goes on to say that alot of these tsuba were actually made somewhere\n  other than Japan, and they are quite different to Nanban tsuba, which\n  simply means in &#39;foreign taste&#39; or done in &#39;foreign metal&#39; etc etc. \n\n  And while we are on the subject, what is the difference between Hizen\n  and Nanban tsuba? They must have alot in common simply because they were\n  probably made in more or less the same place I assume?\n\n  Matt\n\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
