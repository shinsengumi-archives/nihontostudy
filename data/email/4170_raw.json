To \n&gt;   &gt;   find a stiffer\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt;   deer one wo=\r\nuld have to go to the tundra...\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt;   &gt;   I recall well a tsub=\r\na that I found many years ago.  It \nwas a \n&gt;   &gt;   small, copper\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt; =\r\n  sanmai awase (if I correctly remember a phrase I haven&#39;t \n&gt;   uttered \n&gt; =\r\n  &gt;   for 15 or more\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt;   years!) with a touch of silver (tin??) sho=\r\nwing stylised \n&gt;   &gt;   (stamped?) waves with a\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt;   creature on it t=\r\nhat I always thought was an &quot;over-endowed \n&gt;   &gt;   rabbit&quot;, but Bob\n&gt;   &gt;  =\r\n &gt;   Haynes told me was a fox!!  I wrote to Bob when I saw a \n&gt;   similar \n=\r\n&gt;   &gt;   tsuba in one of\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt;   his catalogues.  I was amazed when he s=\r\naid this was a \nvery \n&gt;   early \n&gt;   &gt;   style of tsuba\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt;   ca 1300=\r\n - 1400.  I had it for years, often looking at it \nand \n&gt;   &gt;   saying &quot;Do =\r\nI like\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt;   it, or do I not??&quot;  Same thing with this deer kinko.  I =\r\n\nhave \n&gt;   &gt;   gazed at Pete\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt;   Klein&#39;s image on yahoo (I actually=\r\n have the Lundren \n&gt;   Collection \n&gt;   &gt;   book, but it&#39;s\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt;   out o=\r\nn loan to a &#39;kinko&#39; mate) for a long time on this \n&gt;   sleepless \n&gt;   &gt;   n=\r\night, and I\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt;   ask myself the same question all over again.  So Da=\r\nvid Z, \nif \n&gt;   I \n&gt;   &gt;   could ask you a\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt;   question, when you s=\r\nay &quot;I don&#39;t collect kinko at all,  \nbut \n&gt;   this \n&gt;   &gt;   is one of a\n&gt;   =\r\n&gt;   &gt;   small number of cases which, granted a opportunity, would \n&gt;   lead=\r\n me \n&gt;   &gt;   to alter my\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt;   policy&quot; I have to ask you &quot;WHY??&quot;  Ple=\r\nase explain.\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt;   &gt;   If I found this very tsuba I would thin=\r\nk it was junk.  I \n&gt;   don&#39;t \n&gt;   &gt;   have to tell you\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt;   why.  Or=\r\n do I??  The design spilling into the seppadai I \nhave \n&gt;   &gt;   only seen o=\r\nn tsuba\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt;   I didn&#39;t care for.  The wobbly surface and incredibly b=\r\nad \n&gt;   nanako \n&gt;   &gt;   would kill it\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt;   for me.  And the stiff de=\r\ner doesn&#39;t do anything for me at \n&gt;   all.  \n&gt;   &gt;   However, I would\n&gt;   &gt;=\r\n   &gt;   look at the larger than usual kozuka ana and opine &quot;Hmmm, \n&gt;   maybe=\r\n \n&gt;   &gt;   it&#39;s early&quot;.\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt;   Back to my question to myself &quot;Do I like=\r\n it, or do I \nnot&quot;.  \n&gt;   If I \n&gt;   &gt;   don&#39;t like it,\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt;   I don&#39;t =\r\ncollect it, no matter what the aesthetes say.\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt;   &gt;   Now, t=\r\nhis puts me into the rustic class, I know, but \nthere is \n&gt;   a \n&gt;   &gt;   po=\r\nint to this\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt;   that is not all derisory or derogatory.  It is this=\r\n.  It \nis \n&gt;   easy \n&gt;   &gt;   to pick\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt;   excellent work amongst Edo=\r\n period tsuba , even in the \n&gt;   iron &quot;wabi-\n&gt;   &gt;   sabi&quot; class,\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt;=\r\n   but the archaic styles, the transition between (if we \nmight \n&gt;   say) \n=\r\n&gt;   &gt;   conceptual\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt;   forerunners and the refined later schools is=\r\n much, much \nmore \n&gt;   &gt;   difficult.  Or is\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt;   it??  Recall here =\r\nMilt&#39;s hawk tsuba that lead to the \npresent \n&gt;   &gt;   discussion.  And I\n&gt;  =\r\n &gt;   &gt;   can show you a tsuba that a well-educated (tsuba \nknowledge) \n&gt;   =\r\nmate \n&gt;   &gt;   of mine\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt;   dismissed as &quot;late, possibly 1920s&quot;.  It =\r\nis a masterwork \nof \n&gt;   late \n&gt;   &gt;   Edo/early Meiji\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt;   and belo=\r\nngs to a friend of mine.  If he gives permission \nI&#39;ll \n&gt;   put \n&gt;   &gt;   up=\r\n some images\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt;   of it.\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt;   &gt;   So, to bring this to=\r\n a close, are there any others \ninhabiting \n&gt;   the \n&gt;   &gt;   same closet as=\r\n\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt;   I???  I know I&#39;m lacking an ability, an aesthetic if you \n&gt;   =\r\nlike, to \n&gt;   &gt;   appreciate the\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt;   stiff deer kinko in question a=\r\nnd it worries me.  It seems \n&gt;   without \n&gt;   &gt;   thorough study\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt; =\r\n  and training many tsuba in this time frame would indeed \nbe \n&gt;   &gt;   cons=\r\nidered junk and\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt;   sold off, possibly to an ignominious fate.  The=\r\n other \nkinko \n&gt;   that \n&gt;   &gt;   Pete shows in\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt;   two images at th=\r\ne same link does &quot;speak to me&quot;.  It is \nfrom \n&gt;   the \n&gt;   &gt;   same time fr=\r\name\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt;   and I find it elegant and refined and would collect it.  \nI=\r\n \n&gt;   think \n&gt;   &gt;   this discussion\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt;   parallels the Sue Koto kaz=\r\nuuchimono line of thinking with \n&gt;   blades -\n&gt;   &gt;   I don&#39;t\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt;   c=\r\nollect those either...\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt;   &gt;   Barry Thomas\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt;   (Mel=\r\nbourne, Australia)\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt;   &gt;   ----- Original Message -----\n&gt;   =\r\n&gt;   &gt;   From: &quot;klepet33319&quot; &lt;Ppeterdds@&gt;\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt;   To: &lt;nihontostudy@yaho=\r\nogroups.com&gt;\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt;   Sent: Monday, April 17, 2006 5:50 AM\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt;   S=\r\nubject: [nihontostudy] Re: in defense of the ugly bird \nor \n&gt;   &gt;   seeking=\r\n more &quot;\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt;   punishment &quot;\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt;   &gt;   Link to =\r\nscan &#39;deer&#39; tsuba from Lundgren collection:\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt;   &gt;   \n&gt;   htt=\r\np://ph.groups.yahoo.com/group/nihontostudy/photos/view/7936?b=3D3\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt;=\r\n \n&gt;   &gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt;   &gt;   SPONSORED LINKS Buy fine art  Japanese translation=\r\n  \nJapanese \n&gt;   &gt;   incense  \n&gt;   &gt;   &gt;         Fine art inkjet paper  Fin=\r\ne art printing  Fine art \n&gt;   &gt;   appraisal  \n&gt;   &gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt;  =\r\n &gt; ------------------------------------------------------------\n----\n&gt;   --=\r\n--\n&gt;   &gt;   ----------\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt;   YAHOO!
