It seems it is a poem\n&gt; or haiku about winter, although an exact rendering\n&gt; wasn&#39;t possible.\n\nThanks to Prof. Alex Takeuchi, here&#39;s the full translation\nof the poem.\n\n&quot;In autumn collect the crops that were planted in spring\nand summer and store them in winter&quot;\n\nReferring to the endless cycles of nature, life and death, etc.\nNeat :-)\n\nTranslation mystery solved. Now what school and period?\nWith the well hammered, &quot;S&quot; folded plate, deep black patina\nand dark, rich brass zogan, I tend toward early Shoami\nor maybe Heianjo. The plate almost looks Saotome in quality.\n\nAny thoughts appreciated.\n\nRich S\n\n\n\n"
