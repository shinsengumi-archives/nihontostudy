I\ntook a week of playing and made myself a website.  The\nwebsite is of my collection, including information on\nsymbolism of the praying mantis in fittings.  \n\nwww.freewebs.com/kamakiriken/index.htm\n\nPlease feel free to comment, add, help, etc with\nanything. Milt didn&#39;t like the color scheme, but I\nignored that, however I was surprised to learn I was\nusing green since I thought it was grey (a little\ncolor blind)\n\nI am kind of proud of myself, since inspite of having\nno programs to edit pictures other than XEview and\nmicrosoft paint, and no website programs, I was able\nto put this together with basic knowledge of html.  I\ntaught myself html 8 years ago, but really never used\nit.  It was somewhat fun to go through my collection\nand document my pieces.  I had already took pictures\nfor my records so I had the pictures of my items. \nJust had to upload it.  Lots of free stuff out there\nto use on the internet.\n\nHope you enjoy it and any help or additional\ninformation would be helpful, just email me.  Thanks\nto previewers for their comments.\n\nThanks for looking (in advance).\nKen &quot;THE MANTIS DUDE&quot;\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?
