Did =\r\nyou mean the book that these scans\ncame from? http://www.jpsword.com/files/=\r\nkn/nobuiye.html\nThis webpage is very good for making side by side compariso=\r\nns with the pix\non Mr. Weissberg&#39;s website. I think I can see the sutble di=\r\nfferences in the\nmei now, or perhaps I want to believe I can *grin*. Some m=\r\nore pointers in\nthis direction might be good for me all the same. Are there=\r\n any specifics to\nlook for besides the &#39;softness&#39;?\n\nWith regards to the Aki=\r\nyama tsuba that was found, the mind boggles how it\nwound up on a table at a=\r\n sword show in the US among a pile of other tsuba!\n\nMatt\n\nPs. I know I shou=\r\nldn&#39;t ask, but who was the lucky finder?\n\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFro=\r\nm: &quot;arnold frenzel&quot; &lt;afrenzel@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;matthewhoyle@...&gt;; &lt;nihon=\r\ntostudy@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Monday, January 31, 2005 7:05 PM\nSubject: Re=\r\n: [nihontostudy] Gimei Nobuiye?\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi:\n&gt;  At first glance it does look r=\r\nather nice, however the mei looks \n&gt; tentative, soft and not quite right to=\r\n me. The first thing one would \n&gt; what to do is to consult the book of Akiy=\r\nama collected Nobuiye (title \n&gt; escapes me without reference material here)=\r\n which illustrates the vast \n&gt; bulk of know Nobuiye out there. A few years =\r\nago a well known \n&gt; California dealer was lucky enough to find one at a sho=\r\nw, bought it \n&gt; and it eventually went Juyo. Sure enough is found among the=\r\n Akiyama \n&gt; oshigata. You can be quite sure that if such a tsuba left Japan=\r\n and \n&gt; were correct the price would have at least another zero on the end,=\r\n \n&gt; and probably an initial digit change as well.
