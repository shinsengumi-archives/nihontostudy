Honestly, it is very hard without the sword in hand, but that mark in the orientation shown looks like hachi or a katakana tsu (my katakana is rusty so forgive an error, but I see three strokes).  The conclusion here is that it is a Meiji or Taisho period sword, as the patina on the nakago looks &quot;dignified&quot; and of some age so it can&#39;t be a Showa period gunto.  All guess work, but that &quot; V &quot; mark is very strange indeed...\n\nBarry Thomas.\n\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: excelsiorilluminati \n  To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Wednesday, January 03, 2007 5:55 PM\n  Subject: [nihontostudy] Re: Fwd: Can anyone ID this tsuba?\n\n\n  Hi All, Meanwhile I have tried to match that marking on the nakago. \n  It is no kanji that I can ID, nor is it a sosho derivative or kana in \n  the books. Anyone? Becky, when you&#39;ve the time maybe pics of the \n  hamon and closeups of the nakago, machi area and kissaki will help. \n  Nice puzzle, just need all the pieces.
