Sasano wrote a book that has reproductions from\nKamakura and later period e-maki-mono in which unmounted bushi wearing\nkatana or ko-dachi have what appear to be the same type of tsuba.\n\nGordon\n  -----Original Message-----\n  From: tom helm [mailto:junkmail@...]\n  Sent: Friday, April 25, 2003 3:07 PM\n  To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com\n  Subject: Re: [nihontostudy] tsuba balance\n\n\n  Jim-\n        In my mind Edo period tameshi giri was a very ritualized\n  activity. A whole series of fees had to be paid, divination done, the\n  officials involved had to agree on a schedule, lunch had to be\n  ordered and an agenda that wouldn&#39;t allow for any embarrassment set\n  up. It wasn&#39;t like a carwash, where you drop off your sword and come\n  back later. It had to be done in just such a way. My understanding\n  has always been that the testers used special &quot;testing tsuka&quot; and no\n  tsuba, and probably made a big show of putting it on. I am inclined\n  to see thick tsuba as fashion and personal taste and not practical\n  (though surely they were sturdier than say kyosukashi pieces).\n        I am curious about your thoughts on the use of and changes in\n  the tsuba. Early kenukigata tachi and ito maki tachi have thick soft\n  metal or kawa tsuba, many of these are seen in the catalogs. What\n  mounts do we see the big perfectly circular Kokatchushi and Kotosho\n  tsuba on? In your minds eye what king of mount do you see these on?I\n  could see these large rather thin plates being useful say on\n  horseback, when blade to blade combat would have occurred less often.\n  But as Richard says once we move from tachi to katana, don&#39;t the\n  tsuba have smaller diameters and become a bit thicker? what is the\n  progression as you see it?\n        Kyo-sukashi ostensibly was the rage in the capitol, where\n  artistic merit surely held sway, these pieces made for the elite may\n  have seen battle but were seen as worthy of preservation early on. I\n  am thinking the workingmans&#39; sword guard would be more along the\n  lines of a Hoan, very simple iron and were used up or even tossed out\n  in favor of the latest fad.\n  -t\n\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n        Yahoo!
