From the description it would seem to be in WWII mounts with a leather\ncombat cover, though it may have a partly civilian tsuka. My client is a\nknowledgeable collector, but this is his first nihonto. He has ordered\nseveral books and seems interested in knowing more, at least about this one\nsword.\n \nHe was able to get the mekugi out but has not had the handle off, so we&#39;re\nnot sure if it&#39;s a bar-stock blade or the family Koto heirloom.\n \nI&#39;m sure I&#39;ve met someone from Tucson at one of the shows, but a look\nthrough my card file drew a blank. Anyone in the area willing to help out,\nplease get in touch with me directly with your contact info at\ncraigharris@... and I&#39;ll pass your info on to him.\n \nDON&#39;T hit that reply button.\n \nThanks!\n \nCraig L.
