Nekkogaki yasurimei, &quot;irregular scratches as if done by a cat,&quot; is one of them.  I don&#39;t think that it&#39;s meant to refer to the uniform file finish that&#39;s seen on Goto pieces and others, although it does get misused that way in the West.  \n\nThere are definitely Edo period machibori kozuka with falling rain pattern yasurimei.  It&#39;s not so densely done and does look like ukiyo-e shigure (drizzle).  I suppose that the sujikai yasuri on Goto pieces could depict a downpour... but probably not.  \n\nGiven the aesthetics of early Goto pieces, I don&#39;t think that it was intended as a representational element.  Think of how austere their presentations are.  If it did represent rain and this was somehow important to accompany the shishi, karasu, dragon, etc., they why didn&#39;t it also appear on the shakudo versions of these motifs?\n Jim\n\n\n\n  I never did understand the &quot;cat scratches&quot; idea whereas &quot;falling rain&quot; seems right in keeping with things Japanese. Suspect some 19th century European came up with blaming the cat.  \n\n  Ron\n  STL\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
