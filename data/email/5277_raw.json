My name is Mike and I was \nrecently off=\r\nered a couple japanese swords. I have been collecting \nswords for the past =\r\n10 years or so, but primarily European. The one \nis a WWII officer&#39;s with a=\r\n mei on the blade of Ando Kanemoto. It is \nin beautiful shape and I did not=\r\n see any faults with it at all. \n   The other one has me a bit confused whi=\r\nch is one reason I joined \nthe group. The blade is unsigned, but the tsuba =\r\ndoes have a \nsignature. I have asked a lot of people, but no one is able to=\r\n give \nme a definate answer as to what it is. I assume the 2 sets of \nchara=\r\ncters is that of the smith and the school, but I don&#39;t know for \nsure. Pict=\r\nures of the tsuba and the tsuka can be found in the folder \nI created at:\n\n=\r\nhttp://ph.groups.yahoo.com/group/nihontostudy/photos/browse/9ea7?c=3D\n\nLike=\r\n I hinted at, I am quite new to Japanese weaponry, and \ntranslating kanji i=\r\ns certainly wayyyy out of my field. What I have \nbeen able to come up with =\r\non the tsuba could be a few things. First, \nthe 2 charcters on the left (I =\r\ndon&#39;t know if everyone has the kanji \nfont on their computers but I will pu=\r\nt it here anyways).\n\nI see =89p for sure which I believe is either &quot;teru&quot; o=\r\nr &quot;hide&quot; the 2nd \ncharacter I have not determined for sure.\n\nOn the right s=\r\nide, I see either =97=B3 (tatsu) or possibly `=EA (taki) \nfollowed by, I be=\r\nlieve =8F=E4 (don&#39;t know the pronounciation) and then =8Eq \n(shi).\n\nObvious=\r\nly, what I want to know is who this tsuba is made by and the \nschool it is =\r\nfrom. But also a potential date. I was informed by the \nowner of the sword =\r\nthat it was authenticated by a friend of mine and \nhe thought it to be from=\r\n the late 1600s or 1700s, but that is \ncertainly unclear.\n\nThank you all in=\r\n advance for your help. \n\nMike\n\n\n"
