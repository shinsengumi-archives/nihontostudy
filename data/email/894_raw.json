However when you view it in context the prices paid for works by top e=\r\nnd masters is still comparatively modest. Going back to the Rai Kunimitsu b=\r\nought in 2001. $320k would buy a reasonable/modest house in London. But com=\r\npare that to what you would have to pay for a top work by a 20th. century p=\r\nainter, Luceun Freud currently commands in excess of $1.5million for each n=\r\new painting. In what other field could collectors still buy works by the wo=\r\nrlds leading exponents of their craft throughout history at these prices.\nW=\r\nhat this means for the rest of us mortals is that very high quality work by=\r\n recognised masters can still be obtained affordably, not necessarily easil=\r\ny, but within the realms of possibility. I cant think of another field of a=\r\nrt where this is the case.\n\nJim Gilbert &lt;jggilbert@...&gt; wrote:\nHi=\r\n Paul,\nA lot of the highest level items tend to change hands privately in J=\r\napan.

No doubt there are higher prices=\r\n that I have not heard...\nJim\n\n\n  I think the highest auction price paid fo=\r\nr a sword is still the Kiyomaru bought from the Francis Festing collection =\r\nauction in 1993. That sold for about $450k to a japanese dealer (I think AO=\r\nI-Art). So assume it sold retail for a lot more. Other close contenders wou=\r\nld include some of the blades sold in the Manno collection sale in 2001wher=\r\ne a Rai Kunimitsu made approx $320k.\n\n  &quot;Matthew E.
