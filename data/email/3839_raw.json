I agree on all points.\n\nJim\n\n\n\n  Hi Jim;\n\n  I have studied the work of the Yoshiro and have never encountered a work in this style attributed to any of the Yoshiro workers.  The tsuba in question does not seem to me to have the age to the plate to justify such an attribution.\n\n  The metal in the plate, at least in the picture, shows no resemblance to any of the plates worked by the Yoshiro artists.  Also the theme and design is not one that they were know to produce.  \n\n  They were a very popular group in their day, their work was in high demand and available only to the wealthy.  I find it difficult to believe that they would produce something so drastically different from what their bread and butter products were.\n\n  John\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
