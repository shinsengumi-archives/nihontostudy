Momoyama tea ceramics in Raku, Shino, Oribe, Iga, Seto, Mino, Shigaraki, etc., styles.  There&#39;s a lot more to tea taste than that, but it will be a start.\n\nI think that your idea about debris might have come from terms like gomoku zogan used to describe late, low quality, &quot;random&quot; decoration sometimes retrofitted to older plates.  I don&#39;t think that there was any intention to actually depict debris or puddles.  Tea leaves -- no.  That style of tea is actually a bright green, fine powder, btw.\n\nI don&#39;t see anything Tenbo about the plate, but to your earlier question, there are some Tenbo guards with Yamashiro ju signatures, so presumably there was a relationship with Kyoto at some point.  Who knows where the many poor quality mu-mei ones from later in the Edo period were made.\n\nJim\n\n\n\n  My question was meant to ask how does a Sahari-decorated Tenpo school tsuba achieve &quot;tea taste&quot; style? I had the impression that surfaces decorated with irregular non-clearly representational lumps and patches of mixed-metal solder were intended to resemble beach debris, the bottom of forest mud puddles, or tidal pools.  Is it possible that tsuba were decorated to resemble used tea leaves at the bottom of a tea pot or tea cup? \n\n     \n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
