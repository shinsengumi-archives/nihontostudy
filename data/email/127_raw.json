A \nkid&#39;s magnet will net you a small vial full in a few tens of \nminutes.  A serious Edmund Scientific magnet should get you enough in \nan hour to make a sword, if you could figure out how to smelt it.  \nI&#39;ve thought about making an electromagnet to collect it (better than \na permanent magnet because you can turn it off and drop the magnetite \nyou&#39;ve picked up, rather than try to pull it off the magnet by \nhand).  But, again, what would I do with it?  It has to be heated in \na reducing atmosphere to get iron/steel out of it.  Anyone have an \nidea for a mini-tartara?  BTW, an amateur US swordsmith I spoke with \nyears ago (since lost contact) did make his own tamahagane, and \nforged a small blade from it, and showed same to Yoshihara at the \nSolvang Knife Show.  He told me that Yoshindo immediately recognized \nthe difference in tetsu, and asked the US smith where he got his \nsteel.  I have heard from other sources that the source of the steel \n(tamahagane, mill, electrolytic, wootz, etc.) does indeed result in \ndifferences in the tetsu visible to the experienced viewer.\n\nNC\n\n\n"
