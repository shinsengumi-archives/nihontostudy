From what I can \nsee under the corrosion and layers of soil, it is a straight, single-\nedged iron blade with a nakago that ends in a half-ana. There are 2 \nother mekugi-ana with iron mekugi and the remnant of a copper fitting \nwhere a fuchi would be located. The sword has a plain, round iron \ntsuba with no sukashi. The question I have is, what if any \npreservation should be done for this sword? The condition is very \nfragile and I am not even inclined to brush off the surface dirt on \nthis piece. Any help is greatly appreciated...\n\nhttp://www.sweetpumpkin.co.kr/Images/Chokuto1.jpg\n\nhttp://www.sweetpumpkin.co.kr/Images/Chokuto2.jpg\n\nhttp://www.sweetpumpkin.co.kr/Images/Chokuto3.jpg\n\nhttp://www.sweetpumpkin.co.kr/Images/Chokuto4.jpg\n\nKind regards,\nRay Singer\n\n\n"
