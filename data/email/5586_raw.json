Ko Kinko are\n&gt; the main culprits. Many of them are held together with two little\n&gt; rivets, the fukurin is more to finish off the the tsuba aesthetically.\n&gt; See here (thanks Baz)\n&gt;\n&gt; http://www.nihonto-bijutsubu.com/personal/ko-kinko.jpg\n&gt; http://www.nihonto-bijutsubu.com/personal/ko-kinko-sanmai.jpg\n&gt;\n&gt; The tsuba you are referring to as Sanmai, probably is Ko Kinko, but I\n&gt; guess we would need to see it to be able to make a call like that.\n&gt; Kagami shi (kagami = mirror, shi = maker) usually made tsuba that were\n&gt; cast from bronze or yamagane. I have not seen any sanmei kagamishi\n&gt; tsuba but that does not mean there were not any. I will have a look in\n&gt; Sasano&#39;s little book tonight at home and see if there is any reference.\n&gt;\n&gt; This is a typical Kagami-shi tsuba\n&gt; http://richardturner.wordpress.com/2009/01/17/130/\n&gt;\n&gt; Most likely, all 3 tsuba you have are Ko Kinko.\n&gt;\n&gt; Cheers\n&gt;\n&gt; Richard\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; __,_._\n&gt;\n\n\nElliot, and all,\n\nRichard is spot-on in his observations, of course.\n\nI&#39;m thinking that it&#39;s worth noting that &quot;Ko-Kinko&quot; can tend to be a big box\nin which to sort anything old (Ko) made of soft metal (Kinko) rather than\niron. So the materials can cover the gamut from brass, bronze, yamagane\n(&quot;impure&quot; copper), more refined copper, and even shakudo, and the techniques\ncan range from cast, forged, sanmai, various surface treatments, zogan, etc.\nSome pieces can be easily classified by &quot;school&quot; in the roughest sense of\nthe word - cast guards are invariably &quot;Kagamishi&quot; - and somewhat more\ndecorated guards like your sanmai get called &quot;Ko-Kinko&quot; like they are some\npre-Kinko (fancy) guards. In fact some get further classified as Ko-Goto or\nKo-Mino when they look like the antecedent of those well defined schools\nthat fully flower as we move closer to Edo period.\n\nMy own recent area of interest has been &quot;tachikanagushi&quot; guards which are\nsoft metal thought (by some) to be made by tachi makers who also made\nfittings to go with the blades they made, which is (I think) an interesting\nspeculation without much empirical evidence. In any case you can see much of\nthat collection on Boris Markhasin&#39;s website, on the consignment page, at\nyamabushiantiques.com.\n\nSometimes I think the semantics and classification get in the way of simple\nenjoyment of beautiful art objects, but I approach this study more from an\nart angle.\n\nRegards,\n\nCraig\n\n&gt; ,___\n&gt;\nPS The little Sasano book Richard refers to is a gem, part of a series of\nthree that Sasano did on old soft metal guards, and worth keeping an eye out\nfor.\n\n\n\n-- \nCraig Harris\nBridge of Dreams, LLC\nBooks from and about Asia\nwww.bridgeofdreams.com\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
