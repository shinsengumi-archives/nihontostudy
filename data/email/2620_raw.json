The only opinion I venture is that on tsuba No. 2 the\nhitsuana are not, in fact, hitsuana.  The shape is wrong IMHO.  I suggest\nthat the openings are a design that were later filled in with silver.  The\nblack is more likely to be remnants of black lacquer??  Ninja tsuba??  I\nthink not.  The ninja (if indeed they existed) were comprehensively\ndestroyed by 1600.  I do think this is the best of three put forward.  There\nis just &quot;something&quot; about the beautiful quattrefoil (??) shape...\n\nBestests,\n\nBarry Thomas.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n2... This is a nice little tsuba, it is obviously made for a katana going by\nthe size of the nakago ana, and the crescent moon Hitsu ana ume are very\nnice. We think they may have had shakudo on them, though I was wondering\nif it would have been the black patina that covers silver ??. It&#39;s a\nnice little piece.\n\n73mm x 63mm x 4mm\n\nhttp://www.nihontomessageboard.com/personal/yamato_sword/tsuba_02.jpg\n\n\n"
