I just finished it. \nI am very impressed and sorry I did not purchase it earlier. The \nconcise yet informative text plus the wealth of drawings and plates \nwas well worth the price.\n\nIf there&#39;s anyone else out there interested in the subject and that \nhas been on the fence about this great book because of the price tag, \nwell, stop considering it and buy it. Give it to yourself for \nChristmas. You won&#39;t regret it.\n\nAnd if Roald and Susan subscribe to these lists (or someone who knows \nthem does) please receive a big thank you  from me... This book will \nbe a permanent part of my reference library.\n\nAnyone have any other books on Yari and/or Naginata they want to \nrecommend? I&#39;m thirsty for more knowledge now.\n\nThanks!\n\nAndres \n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
