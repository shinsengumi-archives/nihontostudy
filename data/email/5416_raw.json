My father d=\r\nied not long ago \nand left two samurai swords which are now in my possessio=\r\nn.  He acquired them in Papua \nNew Guinea after the battle of Buna.  One is=\r\n in a plain brown storage case and the other is in \na pebbled case with a l=\r\neather cover.  I hope, over time, to discover all that I can about them.  \n=\r\nAs my father never talked about his 4 years of fighting in the Pacific thea=\r\ntre, these are the \nonly link that my siblings and I have to his time there=\r\n.  We hope that as we learn more about \nthese swords, we will also learn ab=\r\nout those times and the valorous men who fought on both \nsides.  I won&#39;t ha=\r\nve expertise to share, but look forward to learning a great deal from all o=\r\nf \nyou.  Is it permissible to post photos on this site?\n\nChris\n\n\n"
