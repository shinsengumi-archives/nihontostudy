Even \nthe=\r\n kao bears a (very) remote resemblance to that illustrated.\nRegards, John L=\r\n.\n      \n--- In nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Dr John P Lissenden&quot; \n&lt;docli=\r\nss@j...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; Dear Jim\n&gt; Thank you for the interest that you showed,=\r\n and the time that you \n&gt; spent on my query.  It is sometimes a frustrating=\r\n interest; so \noften \n&gt; there are no final answers to our questions.\n&gt; \n&gt; R=\r\negards, John L.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Jim Gilbert&quot; =\r\n\n&lt;jggilbert@E...&gt; \n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; John,\n&gt; &gt; As others have said, today it wou=\r\nld probably be attributed to \n&gt; Katchushi.  When I first glanced at the shu=\r\nmei I picked up on the \n&gt; second character as the &quot;a&quot; =E9=98=BF in Shoami a=\r\nnd then on the next \n&gt; character as the middle kanji =E4=B9=99 from Saotome=\r\n.  Of course the \nrest \n&gt; does not fit either case, although Saotome and Ko=\r\n-Shoami would be \n&gt; somewhat defensible attributions.  The first kanji look=\r\ns like \n&gt; ichi/kazu =E4=B8=80 and the last ko =E5=B0=8F.  I can&#39;t make sens=\r\ne of it, but \n&gt; feel like I must be missing something obvious.  The other \n=\r\ncharacter \n&gt; at the left appears to be a kao, although I do not know who it=\r\n \n&gt; belongs to.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;  I also spent time on your gold seal when you post=\r\ned it, but \n&gt; struck out on that one too.  I don&#39;t have a tensho dictionary=\r\n so I \n&gt; asked my shodo teacher to look it up, but couldn&#39;t conclude on any=\r\n \n&gt; known tsubako.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; They&#39;re both bugging me, so if I turn anything =\r\nup I will post \nit.  \n&gt; Meanwhile, hopefully someone else will take a look =\r\nand settle it.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Sorry,\n&gt; &gt; Jim\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   A colleage=\r\n, and collector, has recently purchased the sukashi \n&gt; tsuba \n&gt; &gt;   illustr=\r\nated in my Photo Album JPL and has asked for my advice \n&gt; &gt;   regarding its=\r\n possible attribution and for a translation of \nthe \n&gt; red \n&gt; &gt;   lacquer i=\r\nnscription  The figure on the bottom left appears to \nbe \n&gt; a \n&gt; &gt;   kao, b=\r\nut I am otherwise at a complete loss.  Any \n&gt; help/suggestions re \n&gt; &gt;   ei=\r\nther of these requests would be much appreciated.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   While you are =\r\nin my Photo Album, I am still seeking some \n&gt; information \n&gt; &gt;   on the gol=\r\nd, hira-zogan seal.  There has been a complete \nabsence \n&gt; of \n&gt; &gt;   replie=\r\ns to my earlier request regarding this.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   Grateful thanks and rega=\r\nrds, JPL.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been r=\r\nemoved]\n\n\n\n\n"
