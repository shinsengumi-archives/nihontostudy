Mr. Haynes listed an almost identical tsuba, I would say clearly  \nfrom the same hand, stating that these were symbols of the battles between  \nTakeda Shingen and Uesugi Kenshin.  So I was trying to pursue that lead.  \n\n\n\n\nI fail to see the connection but then Haynes is Haynes..........\nif there&#39;s an &quot; animal connection &quot;, then it should be a tree and a bird (  \nwoodpecker ? ). Recall that battle when the Takada  diverted part of the  army \nto sneak attack the castle where Uesugi was holding up ? Except when they  \narrived, the Uesugi already left in the fog, crossed the river and attack the  \nTakada base camp. Same battle as Shingen blocked Kenshin&#39;s sword with his war  \nfan.\n \nmilt\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
