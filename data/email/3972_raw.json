Looking at the front of the guard it does appear to be Edo period and indeterminate style.  I suspect that what you&#39;re seeing in the rim may be the structure of the forge welding brought out by the rust.  It&#39;s not unusual to see pronounced layering in, for example, Akasaka guards that have been badly rusted.  Seeing a sharp ridge like that would be unusual for tekkotsu.  Also tekkotsu are usually smoother, darker and more lustrous than the surrounding iron (although not always so with Kanayama).\n\nI do however have a Kanayama tsuba that I think is quite old that has a somewhat similar look in the rim.  I&#39;ve never been able to decide how much of the appearance is due to how it was made vs. how it might have rusted.  Next time I set up to take macro photos I&#39;ll get some images of the rim for comparison.  The face of that guard also looks quite old and in Kanayama style, though.\n\nJim\n\n\n\n  Hi Alan, it may be a little pitted in the mimi but they are bones, and \n  too big I think for edo, though not necessarily so I guess.\n\n  Cheer\n\n  Rich\n\n\n  Alan Bale wrote:\n  &gt; It looks like Edo period Kyo-sukashi in poor shape with a pitted mimi.\n  &gt; Alan\n  &gt;&gt;\n  &gt;   Nice Jim, good work. These are excellent photo&#39;s and an invaluable help. \n  &gt;   If I may, how would you classify this ?.\n  &gt;\n  &gt;   The condition is down a bit ( as are the photo&#39;s sorry ). I bought it as \n  &gt;   Muromachi Owari, then got it and thought it might be Kanayama. There is \n  &gt;   a long large ( rope ) bone in the mimi, and quite a few smaller normal \n  &gt;   bumpy bones. There are also small bones in the hira, running around the \n  &gt;   mimi. I have not been able to pin the theme either, besides the ginger \n  &gt;   leaves.\n  &gt;\n  &gt;   Any clues appreciated.\n  &gt;\n  &gt;   http://www.nihontomessageboard.com/personal/owari-hira.jpg\n  &gt;\n  &gt;   http://www.nihontomessageboard.com/personal/owari-mimi.jpg\n  &gt;\n  &gt;\n  &gt;   best wishes\n  &gt;\n  &gt;   Rich\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
