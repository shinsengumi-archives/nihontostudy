And finally, this piece wasn&#39;t \ndated, but has no arsenal stamps - should\nI be worried that this is one of those pieces described in Kapp&#39;s where \nthey manage to get a nice hizenish\nhada/nie by careful treatment of modern materials?\n\nAny comments would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThanks,\n\nrkg\n(Richard George)\n\n\n\n"
