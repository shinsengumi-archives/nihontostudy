Indeed, a cast kagami is one of  the Three \n&gt; Sacred \n&gt; &gt; Regalia o=\r\nf Japan.  Kagami-shi tsuba, supposedly made in the pre-\nEdo \n&gt; &gt; period by =\r\nmirror makers, may also be of extremely high quality \nand \n&gt; it \n&gt; &gt; is not=\r\n illogical to suppose that many soft-metal tsuba may have \n&gt; &gt; initially be=\r\nen cast.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; But the casting of iron tsuba is, for some reason, very f=\r\nrowned \n&gt; upon by \n&gt; &gt; collectors.  I am personally convinced that the vast=\r\n majority of \n&gt; Namban \n&gt; &gt; tsuba are cast and the poor quality of many of =\r\nthese makes this \n&gt; very \n&gt; &gt; easy to detect with the use, simply, of a bri=\r\nght light and x30 \n&gt; &gt; magnification.  The ease with which casting can be i=\r\ndentified \n&gt; clearly \n&gt; &gt; depends upon the amount of hand finishing which w=\r\nas utilised \n&gt; afterwards.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Many people will justify the casting of=\r\n Manban tsuba as being \n&gt; expected \n&gt; &gt; because of their poor quality, but =\r\nI believe that casting may \nhave \n&gt; been \n&gt; &gt; used far more generally than =\r\nis accepted.  It should be a simple \n&gt; matter \n&gt; &gt; to confirm this, but suc=\r\nh examinations would need to be carried \nout \n&gt; on \n&gt; &gt; tsuba of accepted h=\r\nigh quality in order to avoid the a priori \n&gt; excuse \n&gt; &gt; of &#39;poor quality&#39;=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; White cast iron is not a suitable metal for casting, but the \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; carburisation of grey cast iron to produce  a malleable cast \niron, \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nwhich is ideal for casting small artefacts such as tsuba, is a \n&gt; process \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; that has been known in Japan for several hundred years.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; As to =\r\nwhether the tsuba illustrated in your photo album is cast \nor \n&gt; not, \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nI would hesitate to offer a firm opinion without a hands-on \n&gt; &gt; examinatio=\r\nn.
