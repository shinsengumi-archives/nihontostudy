Over the weekend I did run across a reference \nin &#39;=\r\nThe Goda Collection&#39; book on the use of mercury evaporation \ntechniques wit=\r\nh gold and silver powder addmixture, along with the use \nof soldered inlay =\r\n(onlay) techniques.  It really is quite amazing to \nthink of what they acco=\r\nmplished all those years ago.  Being a dentist \nI found it rather amusing t=\r\nhat they would heat evaporate the mercury \noff leaving the gold or silver a=\r\nll the time thinking of all the fuss \ntoday over silver mercury amalgam fil=\r\nlings.  I wouldn&#39;t be a bit \nsurprised if there were more than a few &#39;mad h=\r\natters&#39; back then!\n\n\n\n--- In nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Gordon Robson&quot; =\r\n&lt;robsongo@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; In the same way. There are a number of different=\r\n methods including \nactual\n&gt; inlays and various washes.\n&gt; \n&gt; Gordon\n&gt; \n&gt; --=\r\n---Original Message-----\n&gt; From: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n[mailto:niho=\r\nntostudy@yahoogroups.com] On\n&gt; Behalf Of klepet33319\n&gt; Sent: Saturday, May =\r\n20, 2006 12:20 AM\n&gt; To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: [nihontostu=\r\ndy] Menuki Fabrication Question\n&gt; \n&gt; Good day all.  I was looking at exampl=\r\nes of Goto menuki this \nmorning \n&gt; and I am curious if anyone knows how the=\r\nse were fabricated with \n&gt; different metals contituting the design?
