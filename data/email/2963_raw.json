Many of us have tried a few things over the years but mostly without satisfactory results. We hate to say to try something that&#39;s not going to give you the correct results. One of the best results I&#39;ve ever had was when a friend of mine would offer to wear a tsuba around his neck for awhile. He worked in a gym and his body sweat (ugh) worked wonders on some tsuba and didn&#39;t work on others (depending on the steel). Personally, I&#39;ve never tried to used one of the traditional formula that can be found. \n\nAncient coins...sounds interesting! \n\nRon\nSTL\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: Richard Turner \n  To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Saturday, May 14, 2005 6:17 PM\n  Subject: Re: [nihontostudy] Re:\n\n\n  Hi Kim, I don&#39;t think anyone will answer that, an inherently dangerous \n  question that could only lead to tears.
