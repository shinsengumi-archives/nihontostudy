I took 3 pieces of 1-2\nmm thick &quot;dog grade&quot; pre-chewed rawhide and soaked them in water for\nseveral hours until they were completely soft and pliable.  I pressed the\nthree layers tightly together between two boards in a bench vise and left\nthem over night.  I then glued the three still moist pieces together with\nan aliphatic wood glue.  I suspect that a hide or hoof glue would be closer\nto what was originally used, but I didn&#39;t have any handy.  Then it went\nback into the vise press over night.\n\nThe stack came out well-adhered, but still flexible.  It was fairly easy to\ncut through with multiple passes of a sharp knife.  After a day of drying\nin the sun, the laminated piece was much more rigid and didn&#39;t warp.\nRainy weather called for subsequent drying in the house.  After a couple of\ndays the 3 layer laminate can still be flexed a few mm by hand.  At this\npoint the laminate is quite hard to cut, but easy to saw or shape with a\nrasp.  The layers stay well adhered during these operations.\n\nI am not trained as a swordsman and I have no swords handy, so I resorted\nto a ca. WWII vintage Gurkha Kukri for test cutting.  The cross section is\non the thick side for a knife, but &quot;sharper&quot; than the typical nihonto.  I\nclamped one end of my &quot;tsuba&quot; to a bench, leaving about 4.5 cm of\nunsupported material sticking out into space.  I had no success in repeated\ntries at cutting the face of the tsuba.  There is enough flex in the\nlaminated leather to send the blade skidding off from the face of the\nguard, just occasionally taking a sliver of material from the edge.  I\nsuppose that a perfect slicing cut with a sword would do more damage, but\nthen again in use you weren&#39;t likely to fight against an opponent with his\nsword hand clamped down to a bench.\n\nTurning the &quot;tsuba&quot; edge up to test cutting straight into the mimi was an\nentirely different story.  A light chop was enough to cut over 1 cm into\nthe edge.  No doubt there were ways to make a tougher guard than I did,\nhowever I have to believe that these would not be sufficient to stop a\nstrong sword cut to the edge from cutting entirely through the guard,\nincluding any yamagane fukurin or o-seppa.\n\nSo, long story, but what I found is that as long as someone else cures the\nhide it&#39;s quite easy to make a functional kawa tsuba.  Lacquer and a\nfukurin would dress the guard up and help protect it from moisture, but I\ndon&#39;t think would change the basic properties of the tsuba.  It is tough\nand light weight, would certainly keep one&#39;s hand from sliding up on the\nblade and it would seem to be effective at stopping a opponent&#39;s cut that\ncame sliding down the blade.  However, it would be next to useless at\nstopping a cut to the edge.\n\nSpeculation -- was there something about the way that a tachi was used that\nwould make a cut to the edge of the guard relatively unlikely when compared\nto wielding a katana?  It might help explain why nerikawa tsuba were the\nguard of choice for fighting tachi, but were replaced by iron for katana.\n\nJim\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\nnihontostudy-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n\n\n\nYour use of Yahoo!
