The &quot;kiri&quot; of course has the three &quot;blooms&quot; and the &quot;ivy&quot; does not. Check out p.37, particularly the left column, third up. I think that&#39;s it. As for the other sukashi designs between the &quot;ivy,&quot; could be anybody&#39;s guess. \n\nI&#39;ve added another photo to my file, one with a black background if anyone&#39;s interested in looking.

The 3-leaf sukashi (if that what it is) does resemble kiri leaves but I wanted to hear that from somebody else. The strange patina is just the quality of the photo...probably a scan. Oddly, that off-color shows up the black lacquer, at least I think that&#39;s what I&#39;m seeing on the posted view. I find this rather fascinating little tsuba, my reason for seeking some feedback from fresh eyes. \n\n  I&#39;m going to send a couple &quot;tests&quot; out after this email. Strange, my nihontostudy email and yahoo email both came back here and was dumped into my spam folder. No replies needed for the &quot;test.&quot; \n\n  Ron\n  STL\n    ----- Original Message ----- \n    From: excelsiorilluminati \n    To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n    Sent: Wednesday, March 19, 2008 4:22 PM\n    Subject: [nihontostudy] Re: Tsuba kantie\n\n\n    Hi Ron, A rather strange patina. Looks brassy coloured in areas. \n    Lighting probably, eh? The sukashi look to be kirimon in shape. Don&#39;t \n    know about the ovals. Nice for a change, from marugata.

It is iron sukashi work of a very unusual (undescribable, \n    to me) shape and design. It measures 70mm x 58mm x 6mm and has \n    remnants of black lacquer remaining on it. The hitsu-ana pillows are \n    interesting in that hey are double-layered, the inside inlay being \n    shakudo with a silver overlaid plate. The tsuba has not been cut \n    down so this is its original shape, in my opinion. Obviously it has \n    been refitted many times. A photo is posted in nihontostudy pictures \n    under Ron STL.
