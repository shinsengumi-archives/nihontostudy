I have recently acquired a sword that seems wor=\r\nthy and interesting enough to warrant a Japanese polish, a saya/habaki and =\r\nsubmission for papers. Despite I have seen the details of this process a fe=\r\nw times on this list, I don&#39;t remember everything, and I certainly don&#39;t kn=\r\now the chronology of events and their respective costs (approximate) and th=\r\ne amount of time involved.\n\nCould someone tell me (again) the steps involve=\r\nd in sending a sword to Japan, having it polished, having a new habaki and =\r\nshirasaya made and submitting it for papers? I am particularly sketchy and =\r\nforgetful with regard to the use of agents, how to navigate the blade throu=\r\ngh customs, making sure it gets to who it needs to get to, etc. Also, I hav=\r\nen&#39;t a clue as to how much this will all cost, nor how long it takes. Any h=\r\nelp is appreciated. Thank you.\n\nBest Regards,\nGary Gabelhouse\n\n[Non-text po=\r\nrtions of this message have been removed]\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Non-text portion=\r\ns of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
