The hamon \nrunning off\n&gt; &gt; the kissaki IS a fatal flaw,=\r\n make no bones about that. Swords \nwith fatal\n&gt; &gt; flaws that make Tokubetsu=\r\n Hozon, Juyo or Yashu saku are swords of\n&gt; &gt; extraordinary worth, and a fla=\r\nw that is fatal can not take away \nit&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; history. These swords are typic=\r\nally famous because they are \nrare, or\n&gt; &gt; were carried by someone importan=\r\nt or famous. General swords, \nmade by the\n&gt; &gt; not so famous sword smiths, n=\r\no matter how nice will most likely \nfail all\n&gt; &gt; attempts at kanteisho if t=\r\nheirs is a fatal flaw like the hamon \nrunning\n&gt; &gt; off the Ha or Kissaki, a =\r\nHagiri and the likes.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; We all learn hard lessons and we never like b=\r\neing told that our \nhard\n&gt; &gt; earned and well spent money if for naught, but=\r\n this is a mugs \ngame, it\n&gt; &gt; takes nerves of steel and a firm resolve. All=\r\n I can suggest is \nto get\n&gt; &gt; over it and move on. I mean that in the nices=\r\nt possible way. I \nam not\n&gt; &gt; trying to be smart, just realistic.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; G=\r\nood luck\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Richard Turner\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Elliott wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I was co=\r\nmplaining about learning nothing from shinsa (NY 2006)\nother\n&gt; &gt; &gt; than a f=\r\nalling off temperline in the tip is (maybe) a fatal \nflaw.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Since I am=\r\n definitly a &#39;newbee&#39; and I study, study, study, I \nfound\n&gt; &gt; &gt; something c=\r\nalled YAKIOTOSHI.
