I&#39;m still experimenting\n&gt;   with =\r\nphotography and did not clean these images at\n&gt;   all.\n&gt; \n&gt;   The shishi ts=\r\nuba is nice. The nanako is very good and\n&gt;   interesting in that it changes=\r\n pattern on the sections\n&gt;   with the shi-shi. My hesitation is that the ge=\r\nneral\n&gt;   work is very good but not Goto grade. How else might\n&gt;   this one=\r\n be attributed?\n&gt; \n&gt;   The second tsuba is solid shakudo of excellent color=\r\n\n&gt;   and very heavy. The carving is lush and extremely\n&gt;   detailed. Despit=\r\ne the thickness of the piece and the\n&gt;   carving, everything has a smooth r=\r\noundedness to it so\n&gt;   that there are no obtruding edges.\n&gt; \n&gt;   Any help =\r\nappreciated. I&#39;d like to figure these out as\n&gt;   much as possible before I =\r\nconsider whether to submit\n&gt;   to shinsa.\n&gt; \n&gt;   Thanks,\n&gt; \n&gt;   Curran\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; \n&gt;   __________________________________________________\n&gt;   Do You Yaho=\r\no!?\n&gt;   Tired of spam?
