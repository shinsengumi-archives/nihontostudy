One is\nwith Gama Senin- a mythical sage who is often seen with a toad on his shoulder.  Sort of his\nfamiliar.\nThe other is the story of Ono-no-tofu, whereby a would-be civil servant is encouraged to try once\nagain at taking his exams after watching a frog perservere in his attempts to jump out of a pond,\nup a steep bank.  A frog could therefore be seen as a symbol of perserverance.  \n\n\n-Doug Sanders\n&gt;    At the same time I saw these two odd-guys, I saw a\n&gt; tsuba with another stylized frog / toad wearing a\n&gt; similar quirked expression. An wise man or priest was\n&gt; standing in the backgound overlooking the frog with a\n&gt; jovial look on his face.\n&gt;    I did no know if there was a story here. Other than\n&gt; Kermit, I&#39;m not too fond of frogs.\n&gt; \n&gt; Curran\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- Jim Gilbert &lt;jggilbert@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Curran,\n&gt; &gt; For what it&#39;s worth I used to have a pair of menuki\n&gt; &gt; in exactly that &quot;pose&quot; that were signed on the edge\n&gt; &gt; Yoshioka Inabanosuke.  They were better quality than\n&gt; &gt; these appear to be, and were not what I&#39;d think of\n&gt; &gt; as typical Yoshioka group work.  It can be tough to\n&gt; &gt; attribute a lot of the unsigned later menuki to a\n&gt; &gt; specific group.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Jim\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   Groups-\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   Came across these unusual menuki. Figured it might\n&gt; &gt;   interest some others.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   http://www.l-wise.co.jp/sword/sdata24/clk259b.htm\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   Any chance anyone can attribute this ugly duo to\n&gt; &gt; any\n&gt; &gt;   specific school? I&#39;m assuming they are late late\n&gt; &gt; Edo\n&gt; &gt;   or Meiji.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   Curran\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been\n&gt; &gt; removed]\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; __________________________________\n&gt; Do you Yahoo!?\n&gt; New Yahoo!
