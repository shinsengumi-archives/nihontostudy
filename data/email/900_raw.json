Surely, a suitable mekugi could \nbe made to fit an old ana.  so my question remains, why the three \nmekugi ana?\n\n  2nd - The blade is over priced, at least from the prices I have \nseen on much more interesting looking Koto tanto on the web that had \npapers, were ubu, mumei, and even came in full koshire, that were \nmuch less expensive.  I am most likely wrong on this. \n\n  3ird - If the seller is who i suspect & living in Montreal (see e-\nbay seller profiel), he his very well thought of, judging from the \ncomments on his web site. I will not give that address out since he \nmight care to remain unkown on e-bay, but the elder members I am sure \nknow who I am talking about.\n\nLastly, I apologise for talking so much, as a new member and novice \nto Nihon-to.  I find the whole subject exciting and tend to run on & \non.  I am sure this enthusiasim will fade somewhat over the years, \nand burnish to a soft cynisim.\n\nDoug\n\n\n"
