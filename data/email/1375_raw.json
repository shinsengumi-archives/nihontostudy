I&#39;ll look for any illustrations that could do a reasonable job of capturing the differences.\n\n  BTW, I think the commonly used &quot;Mino Goto&quot; term may be confusing things.  We&#39;re talking about Mino.  Mino from before the Edo period is Ko-Mino.\n  Jim\n  ------\n\n  3. Could someone perhaps do a photo comparison for the list between\n  genuine (16th century?) Mino goto stuff and later rubbish copies? I\n  think that would be extremely educational. Just like what you did at the\n  SF show Jim? \n\n  thanks, Matt \n\n\n\n\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  Yahoo!
