Since this example was mounted on a nagamaki pole, the shape of\nthe ana matches the shape of the pole.  Probably about the same shape as a\nshinai.  I&#39;m certainly not saying that this tsuba is anywhere near as old as\nKofun jidai.  It&#39;s probably late Edo period, maybe mid Edo at the oldest.\n\nBTW, the Heian through Muromachi period nerikawa tachi tsuba have the\ntypical wedge shaped nakago ana that you&#39;d expect for a sword.\n\nJim\n\n&gt; Tom, Jim, etc.\n&gt;\n&gt; I refrained on this one, because I figured I didn&#39;t\n&gt; know enough. Glad to hear Tom speak up.\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;ve seen only a few examples of the early tsuba shape\n&gt; I thought Jim was referring to..., but this one looked\n&gt; like an old kendo shinae tsuba to me too. Similar to\n&gt; ones an old teacher had on tsuba and shinae preserved\n&gt; in the &#39;school museum&#39; back when I was in highschool\n&gt; south of Nagoya in 1989.\n&gt;     Didn&#39;t the old tsuba soft metal, leather and such,\n&gt; have more of a teardrop shape to their appeture?-not\n&gt; the fattened out oval shape of leather shinae tsuba&#39;s\n&gt; opening?\n&gt;\n&gt; Curran\n&gt;\n\n\n"
