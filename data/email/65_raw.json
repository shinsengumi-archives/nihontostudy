A whole series of fees had to be paid, divination done, the \nofficials involved had to agree on a schedule, lunch had to be \nordered and an agenda that wouldn&#39;t allow for any embarrassment set \nup. It wasn&#39;t like a carwash, where you drop off your sword and come \nback later. It had to be done in just such a way. My understanding \nhas always been that the testers used special &quot;testing tsuka&quot; and no \ntsuba, and probably made a big show of putting it on. I am inclined \nto see thick tsuba as fashion and personal taste and not practical \n(though surely they were sturdier than say kyosukashi pieces).\n\tI am curious about your thoughts on the use of and changes in \nthe tsuba. Early kenukigata tachi and ito maki tachi have thick soft \nmetal or kawa tsuba, many of these are seen in the catalogs. What \nmounts do we see the big perfectly circular Kokatchushi and Kotosho \ntsuba on? In your minds eye what king of mount do you see these on?I \ncould see these large rather thin plates being useful say on \nhorseback, when blade to blade combat would have occurred less often. \nBut as Richard says once we move from tachi to katana, don&#39;t the \ntsuba have smaller diameters and become a bit thicker? what is the \nprogression as you see it?\n\tKyo-sukashi ostensibly was the rage in the capitol, where \nartistic merit surely held sway, these pieces made for the elite may \nhave seen battle but were seen as worthy of preservation early on. I \nam thinking the workingmans&#39; sword guard would be more along the \nlines of a Hoan, very simple iron and were used up or even tossed out \nin favor of the latest fad.\n-t\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
