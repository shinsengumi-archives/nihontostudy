First with a print catalog advertised in the Japanese Sword Society, United States newsletter and a militaria newsletter called Bansai. If you needed a clip for your Nambu with specific serial number Bansai was the place to go. The display ads in both publications was where we first used the dragonfly design. Back then it was from a pattern book and later adopted as the logo. Two years prior I had been told by a book seller in Pennsylvania that there were only three books on Japanese Swords and, &quot;once you have those you have them all.&quot; There is no point in speculating on the number of Japanese sword and related titles were published, but suffice to say it are well more that three.\n           Fifteen-years later I am writing having just purchased a book collection from a collector who was one of my first contacts after first subscribing to the JSS/US Newsletter. A number of these books have come  back as they were originally purchased from satcho; it is not the first time that books have returned in this manner or sure. This collection along with others recently purchased has prompted this listing and some though on my reflections about different types of books and how each is used, IE: what is the utility of a given book.  \n\nContinued; see &quot;Book Survey&quot;\n\n\nAdvanced Notice of New Arrivals\n\nInventory changes quickly - especially the many popular out-of-print titles that we carry where stock is limited.
