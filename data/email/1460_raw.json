Large pieces of iron would have \n&gt;been very expensive but large rocks were free except for the lifting, \n&gt;hauling and dressing.  I&#39;ve read some speculation somewhere about stone \n&gt;anvils having an influence on early sword steel patterns.  When it comes to \n&gt;finish work on tsuba it&#39;s easier to make and use a stone texture punch than \n&gt;trying to hammer on a stone get the texture.  If anyone wants to make such \n&gt;a punch, all it takes is a cheap propane torch, a rod of tool steel, a rock \n&gt;and a hammer.  I can tell you how to do it.\n&gt;\n&gt;Jim\n&gt;   Would love to find out if they did indeed use\n&gt;   an irregular hammer and anvil in the old days, I wonder if anyone else\n&gt;   could give us some more thoughts on this?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nLet the new MSN Premium Internet Software make the most of your high-speed \nexperience. http://join.msn.com/?pgmarket=en-us&page=byoa/prem&ST=1\n\n\n"
