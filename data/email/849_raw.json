Paperback. We\nrequested Bob Orssman look for it, but he could not\nfind it. It is supposedly a $25 book, and not very\nold.\n   Jim G. purchased it from a book dealer. In it there\nare some outstanding rapier style examples, including\nnear matching western pieces upon which they may have\nbeen based.\n\nI do not recall much in the way of cupped guards. \n  Could you please give your opinion against the\ncupped guards being not attributed to westerd style?\nI&#39;ve heard 2 arguments against it, but not in much\ndepth.\n\nAs i mentioned, many of the tsuba &#39;cup&#39; the wrong way.\nThe one I recently picked up is more of a bowl shape\n(more of an L edge to it, but about 1 cm deep), and\nwould have been worn correctly cupped towards the\nhand.\n\nCurran\n\n\n\n--- Peter A Bleed &lt;pbleed1@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; Friends,\n&gt; I have become rather interested in Namban tsuba that\n&gt; are made to look like\n&gt; rapier guards. They are pretty rare and I own only a\n&gt; couple and have seen\n&gt; only a few others. In that regard, I have liked\n&gt; looking at other Namban\n&gt; tsuba and cupped guards. All that to say this is an\n&gt; interesting thread.\n&gt; John, I&#39;d love to see your rapier style guard if you\n&gt; can post a pic.\n&gt; Let me say, however,  that I am not certain about\n&gt; the link between cupped\n&gt; tsuba and European swords. I have seen a number of\n&gt; cupped tsuba that I\n&gt; suppose could be inspired by European cuphilts, but\n&gt; may of these look like\n&gt; they are Hizen style rather than &quot;Namban&quot; (whatever\n&gt; that is). Furthermore,\n&gt; in the case of the tsuba that got this conversation\n&gt; started, it looks to me\n&gt; like the cup would have pointed TOWARD the blade!\n&gt; Pretty different from the\n&gt; European cuphilt style.\n&gt; Peter\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Peter Bleed\n&gt; Associate Dean\n&gt; College of Arts and Sciences\n&gt; 1223 Oldfather Hall\n&gt; University of Nebraska\n&gt; Lincoln, NE 68588-0312\n&gt; (402) 472-2891\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nThe New Yahoo!
