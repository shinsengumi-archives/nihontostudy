I was quoting more in part from what I had been taught, ( I guess there is a lot of different information out there ) I was also reading in a Tsuba book ( I think ) about the same theory, Thinner light tsuba were in vogue when the sword was used form the Katana as apposed to the two handed technique on the ground. I will see if I can dig that information up again.\n\nThanks for correcting me.\n\nRich\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: tom helm \n  To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Friday, April 25, 2003 9:03 AM\n  Subject: Re: [nihontostudy] tsuba balance\n\n\n        Greetings all-\n  I have to agree with Moses, sometimes a heavy tsuba adds a difference \n  but I think it is more psychological than practical.
