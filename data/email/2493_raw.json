Anyone know what I&#39;m dealing with here?\n&gt; \n&gt; Signature looks like Masanori to me. Can someone identify who he is\n&gt; exactly? \n&gt; \n&gt; http://www.nihonto.ca/fittings.html\n&gt; \n&gt; The material is silver. There is a kao on the tsuba and a \nsignature on\n&gt; the fuchi, and the styles do match. There is a kojiri on this saya \nas\n&gt; well, along with a fuchi and koiguchi that are all done in the same\n&gt; style. It&#39;s very nice, all pieces are silver.\n&gt; \n&gt; Anyone have recommendations about the care and feeding of silver\n&gt; fittings (Jim?). I&#39;m guessing leave it alone and don&#39;t touch it.\n&gt; \n&gt; The patina on silver is caused unfortunately by sulphur in the air,\n&gt; which is a product of the industrial revolution. Black Tarnish \n(silver\n&gt; sulfide) is not a native and normal patina for old silver in the \ndays\n&gt; when it was made... it&#39;s pretty uneven on the tsuba as can be \nseen, and\n&gt; the kashira is also kind of rough.\n&gt; \n&gt; I do want to know though if there is a proper care procedure if \nsomeone\n&gt; does know. As well, I&#39;d like to submit this koshirae for papers and\n&gt; want to make sure I&#39;m doing everything right.\n&gt; \n&gt; - darcy\n\nDear Darcy\n\nYes - the signature on the fuchi is, indeed, Masanori.  &#39;Kinko \nMeikan&#39; shows only one artist using these kanji (p.453, lower \nright), but this is not the same artist.  Haynes, in his &#39;Index of \nJapanese Sword Fittings ...&#39;, lists no fewer than seven such \nartists  but does not show the kakihan (H 04383.0 - H 04389.0).\n\nThe seal on the tsuba I, personally, do not recognise.\n\nSo the fuchi is by a Masanori, but which one?  If it is indeed part \nof a set, the tsuba with its seal might possibly help in the \nidentification of the artist.\n\nRegards, John L. \n\n\n\n\n"
