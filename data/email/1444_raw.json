Thanks\nIn response to your comments, I took a look again and some of my katchushi\nguards last night (they used to be so common and cheap that I couldn&#39;t\navoid becoming a &#39;collector&#39;). I have always loved the finish of these\ntsuba which looks old and natural but which is also obviously the creation\nof human intention. I am not familiar with Gemmell&#39;s book, but - like Jim -\nI am sceptical about the use of a pointed hammer to created tsuba surfaces.\nI can believe that a kinko might make and use a hammer with a network of\nvery fine points. As I think about it, use of irregular hammer and anvil\nsurfaces during the forging of the initial plate might be a means of\nsetting up the internal irregularities we call bones etc.\nI agree with Jim, too, that whatever means was used to created a surface\nfinish, it probably involved a chisel or punch rather than direct pounding\nwith a hammer.\nIn that regard, let me recall a conversation with Hagawa-san, the Sendai\nkinko I have mentioned to the list before. He makes frequent use of\n&quot;ishime&quot; which is a smooth but &#39;irregular&#39; surface of small dots that looks\nlike a stone (ishi means stone). He told me that ishime is as hard to do as\nnanako. It is done with specially crested punches (&#39;tagane&#39;) that are\nstruck with a hammer - one dot at a time. Hagawa-san said that once\nstarted, an entire surface had to be done in one setting to assure a\nuniform texture. If the work was interrupted, the piece will be ruined.\nThus, before he starts an ishime surface, he tells his wife and family that\nthey should not interrupt him til the tapping stopped. Maybe the point here\nis that even if special tools are used, it is still the craftsman&#39;s skill\nand intensity that matters.\n\nPeter Bleed\n\n\n"
