Nerikawa tsuba seem to have been in use for at least 200 years, so I&#39;m not sure I&#39;d call them a brief fad.  However, it seems plausible that the tactics of the Muromachi period that lead to more chaotic conditions of massed combat on foot with shorter swords and probably less skilled (and confident) combatants called for a tsuba that could stand up to a cut to its rim, making the nerikawa guard obsolete.\n\n  Jim\n\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n        Yahoo!
