On the left side of the seppa dai there are faint kaisho style mei =\r\nthat might read Myochin.  If that&#39;s what it is I suppose that it could be t=\r\nhe plate maker.  \n\nThere is a Yoshitame listed in Wakayama and Haynes.  It&#39;=\r\ns Haynes #H12160.  Personal name Seiunsha [=E9=9D=92=E9=9B=B2=E8=88=8E], wo=\r\nrked in Kanazawa in Kaga, ca. 1800, &quot;made tsuba.&quot;\n\nNo mention of Myochin, b=\r\nut of course there were Myochin people making iron plate tsuba in Kaga at t=\r\nhat time.\n\nJim\n\n\n\n\n  Hi there,\n\n  I have a tsuba that I am trying to do som=\r\ne research on, it has an \n  elaborate grassscript type writing on it that I=\r\n have had \n  translated.   It turns out that it is a haiku peom written by =\r\n\n  Baishitsu (1769-1852), and it means reads &quot;Various impressions are \n  gi=\r\nven to me every time the scenery of the season where the plum tree \n  bloom=\r\ns is seen&quot;. \n\n  There is also asignature which I am told is the engraver of=\r\n the \n  haiku poem, &quot;Yoshitame&quot;.  Does anyone know who this person was or \n=\r\n  what school he engraved for?\n\n  Does anyone have information on this tsub=\r\na?\n\n  Here is the link:\n\n  http://www.japaneseswordcollector.com/tsuba.jpg\n=\r\n\n  Thanks in advance.\n\n  Regards,\n\n  Louis \n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this m=\r\nessage have been removed]\n\n\n"
