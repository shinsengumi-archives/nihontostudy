(I think that I&#39;ve seen some even older tachi tsuba with wave motif, but I&#39;d have to dig for proof.)  \n\nThe style of the waves and dots of spray on this example are seen in Shoami work.  I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve seen this exact style of wave carving in Ko-Shoami (pre Edo) work.  Overall the guard looks like early to mid Edo period.  That center diamond shape plate is seen in some Kyo Shoami work and the iri mokko shape is seen in Iyo Shoami.  The better people from those regions tended to sign their work and in this case it&#39;s hard to get more specific than Shoami.\n\nJim\n\n\n  -T,\n  why ?  you mean early tsuba has no wave design ?\n\n  -M\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
