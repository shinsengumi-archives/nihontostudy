Having returned to =\r\n\na &#39;Nihonto&#39; state of mind, were you able to find that other character \nfor=\r\n the lousy mei of Mune-? Tom gave me a lead that I have studied.\n\nI am cont=\r\ninuing my pursuit of possibly figuring out this signature. \n\nThanks for Tom=\r\n&#39;s and your effort,\n\nElliott \n\n--- In nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Barry =\r\nThomas&quot; &lt;warlord@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Tom,\n&gt; \n&gt; It&#39;s a pretty lousy MUNE-  I ha=\r\nve another character in mind but \nhaven&#39;t looked for it yet.  It is well-kn=\r\nown that most signatures on \nkogatana are spurious, and IMHO these are no e=\r\nxception.  Elliot, I am \nsorry but it pains me to say that the characters a=\r\nre crudely \nchiselled with no finesse whatsoever.  A cursory run through my=\r\n \nkogatana book does not reveal any examples signed in such a \nrudimentary =\r\nmanner.  I have found a Tadahiro but it is nothing like \nthe piece under co=\r\nnsideration.  I doubt there is much to learn from \nthese pieces.  It always=\r\n pays to bear in mind one of Albert \nYamanaka&#39;s immortal sayings &quot;Looking a=\r\nt bad swords ruins your eye&quot;.  \nIt is no less true for kogatana...  But as =\r\nTom says, thanks for \nposting Elliot.  As a counter to Albert&#39;s advice, one=\r\n of my truisms \nhas always been &quot;Look at everything&quot;...\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; Bar=\r\nry Thomas.\n&gt; \n&gt;   ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt;   From: Tom Helm \n&gt;   To:=\r\n nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n&gt;   Sent: Wednesday, March 28, 2007 3:56 PM\n=\r\n&gt;   Subject: Re: [nihontostudy] photos added to album\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   Elliott -\n&gt;=\r\n   looks like quite a bit of the mei is missing but I would look at \n&gt;   Hi=\r\ntachi no Kami Muneshige of Settsu.
