I think the important thing to remember is that if you \nare unsure, do what is safest, i.e a silk or cotton cloth will do little \ndamage so it should be fine just fussin over the tsuba that way.\n\nI love reading the section in Tsuba, An Aesthetic Study on the mixtures \nmade up in the old days that were used to bake the patina in include Rat \ndung, clay, blood ect.\n\nRich\n\nRon Hartmann wrote:\n\n&gt; A friend of mine who worked in a gym (sweated a lot) used to \n&gt; occasionally take one of my iron tsuba and wear it around his neck, \n&gt; day and night. Yes, he even slept with it! (Lord only knows...) Two of \n&gt; these tsuba took on a wonderful color within a month while another--it \n&gt; seems it was a later tsuba of a more dense/harder plate--did not color \n&gt; much. Like Cary&#39;s tsuba from years ago--tsuba in the pocket \n&gt; treatment--sometimes natural oils (juices) work, sometimes they don&#39;t.\n&gt;\n&gt; Ron\n&gt; STL\n&gt;\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
