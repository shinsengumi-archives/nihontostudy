He\n&gt; says it is 130 to 140 yeears old.  I&#39;ve never seen one like it\n&gt; before. It&#39;s saya is made of bamboo.  The tsuba is gold or brass with\n&gt; what look like narcissus flowers and pods.  The blade is forged but\n&gt; doesn&#39;t appear to be high-quality steel (hamon is midare).  The\n&gt; kojiri of the saya is flared.  The kissaki is O and the mune is\n&gt; ihori. The boshi is midare-komi on one side and almost Jizo on the\n&gt; other.  Nakago appears to be tanago. The ji has what looks like long\n&gt; faint lotus flowers decorating it.\n&gt;\n&gt; More strangely, there is no kashira, same, ito, menuki, on the tsuka,\n&gt; which I believe is made of wood, rather than bamboo.\n&gt;\n&gt; I ran the characters past a Korean and a Chinese woman and neither\n&gt; could tell me anything. No surprise there, however I couldn&#39;t\n&gt; identify the characters in either the Japanese or Chinese character\n&gt; references on the Web.\n&gt;\n&gt; If any of you fine scholars can tell me what Ive gotten myself into,\n&gt; or where it might actually be from and when, I would appreciate it.\n&gt; Please respond to the group and to my email address:\n&gt; grandone@... I&#39;m located in the USA.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks so much for reading all this.\n&gt;\n&gt; Regards,\n&gt;\n&gt; Jim\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
