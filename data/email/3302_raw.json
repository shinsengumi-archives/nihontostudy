Polishing takes a layer off (more if not done by an expert), \nand leaves the blade that much more vulnerable to humidity the first \ncouple of months. I don&#39;t know where you&#39;re located, but the \nfrequency of your cleanings would depend on the environment, too. The \nmore humidity the blade is exposed to, the more frequently your sword \ncleaning kit should be put to use.\n\nHope that helps.\n\nAndres\n\nAt 04:32 PM 9/7/2005, you wrote:\n&gt;I just had a beat-up old sword polished.  First polish job I&#39;ve had done.\n&gt;The sword arrived back wrapped in plastic wrap and seems to have some\n&gt;preservative oil (choji oil?) on it.  I was about to get out the uchiko\n&gt;powder and start cleaning, when it occurred to me, perhaps I should ask:\n&gt;what&#39;s the correct drill for caring for newly polished blades?\n&gt;\n&gt;David Zincavage\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Yahoo!
