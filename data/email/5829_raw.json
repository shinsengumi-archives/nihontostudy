The heavy 32.7=\r\n5&quot; blade is unsigned but inscribed =92ichi=92 as are the yamagane fuchi, ko=\r\ni-guchi and one seppa, the open end of the tsuka is similarly marked in ink=\r\n under the fuchi. The tsuba is 16th century Tachi-kanagushi work lacquered =\r\nred and may be original to the mounting.\n\nThe blade is too discoloured to s=\r\nee any details but it has ububa of 7&quot; and the edge side of the habaki has a=\r\n slot cut into it to allow for this.  \n\nI assume this is the first of a gro=\r\nup of similarly mounted weapons ordered by a clan or Temple. I think that t=\r\nhe sword has been kept in storage for a very long time as it is not for eve=\r\nryday use, weighing around 6lbs and is 4&#39;7&quot; long overall and is in mostly g=\r\nood condition but with worm holes in the leather bound tsuka\n\nI would like =\r\nto know if anyone on the list has seen a similarly mounted nagamaki, the bl=\r\nack sam=E9 and red lacquered binding are distinctive. I would like to know =\r\nwhere it came from.\n\nI have uploaded images at:\nhttp://www.esnips.com/web/T=\r\nsubaFittings \n\n\n--\nI am using the free version of SPAMfighter.\nWe are a com=\r\nmunity of 7 million users fighting spam.\nSPAMfighter has removed 9 of my sp=\r\nam emails to date.\nGet the free SPAMfighter here: http://www.spamfighter.co=\r\nm/len\n\nThe Professional version does not have this message\n\n\n[Non-text port=\r\nions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
