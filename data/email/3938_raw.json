These are excellent photo&#39;s and an invaluable help. \nIf I may, how would you classify this ?.\n\nThe condition is down a bit ( as are the photo&#39;s sorry ). I bought it as \nMuromachi Owari, then got it and thought it might be Kanayama. There is \na long large ( rope ) bone in the mimi, and quite a few smaller normal \nbumpy bones. There are also small bones in the hira, running around the \nmimi. I have not been able to pin the theme either, besides the ginger \nleaves.\n\nAny clues appreciated.\n\nhttp://www.nihontomessageboard.com/personal/owari-hira.jpg\n\nhttp://www.nihontomessageboard.com/personal/owari-mimi.jpg\n\n\nbest wishes\n\nRich\n\nJim Gilbert wrote:\n&gt; Ken,\n&gt; I photographed some Kanayama tekkotsu and posted them here:\n&gt;\n&gt; http://ph.groups.yahoo.com/group/nihontostudy/photos/browse/d4b0\n&gt;\n&gt; Hopefully it will make things more rather than less clear.  It&#39;s difficult to capture the whole package in a few photos.\n&gt;\n&gt; JIm\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   Jim,\n&gt;\n&gt;   While I am reading kantei #2 and becoming familiar\n&gt;   with the groups people are talking about, you didn&#39;t\n&gt;   give me a chance to ask a question back on #1.  Is it\n&gt;   possible to get picture of the tekkotsu from kanayama\n&gt;   for comparison?  I am visual, there is a dirty joke in\n&gt;   there, and that would really help sink it into the\n&gt;   brain.\n&gt;\n&gt;   Very interesting all of this.  I have lots of books I\n&gt;   just purchased and several months of reading.  Just\n&gt;   have to finish the sword section of the boston museum\n&gt;   and I&#39;m into 4 or 5 tsuba books.  Hopefully, I can\n&gt;   start to get a handle on some of this.  So I wouldn&#39;t\n&gt;   even begin to give an answer.  \n&gt;\n&gt;   Thanks again.\n&gt;   Ken\n&gt;\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt; Yahoo!
