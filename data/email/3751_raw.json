Over  \nthe years several attempts were made by the Tokyo government to  \nreturn swords to their owners. Once they were sure there would be no  \nmore claims made, the swords were examined, sorted and the average to  \nbetter ones restored. These were then returned to the prefectual  \ngovernments of their respective places of origin. Thus swords from  \nSesshu went to Osaka and swords from Musashi stayed in Tokyo. Some of  \nthem turn up on display in the local museums and there was a catalog  \nfrom one of the more recent exhibitions if I remember correctly. Look  \nfor akabane-to...\n-t\n\n"
