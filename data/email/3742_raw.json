John       --- \nIn nihontostudy@yahoog=\r\nroups.com, Richard Turner &lt;ikkanshi@w...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; John, Craig and all. =\r\nI had a look in Toso Kodogu Meiji Taikan and \n&gt; Wakayama shows one example =\r\nthere. The kanji for both Guro and Mori \nare \n&gt; quite different. The Guro i=\r\ns well separated in all the strokes on \nJohn&#39;s \n&gt; example and the the publi=\r\nshed mei is quite compact and tight.. The \nmori \n&gt; is also think and tight =\r\nin Wakayama&#39;s but on John&#39;s piece, quite \nwide. \n&gt; Also the Kao looks a bit=\r\n different as well.\n&gt; \n&gt; So, after all that, not sure. Some of these guys c=\r\nhanged their mei \nas \n&gt; they aged, or matured.\n&gt; \n&gt; Cheers\n&gt; \n&gt; Rich\n&gt; \n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; Craig Harris wrote:\n&gt; &gt; John,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Haynes lists two Ishiguro Masamo=\r\nri that signed with these kanji, \nH\n&gt; &gt; 04225.0 and H 04227.0 - the first s=\r\naid to be a student of the \nfirst\n&gt; &gt; Ishiguro Masatsune (H 04751.0)  but a=\r\nn independent artist, but \nthe\n&gt; &gt; name was also used by the second Ishigur=\r\no Masatsune H 04752.0. \nThe\n&gt; &gt; second Masamori listing appears to be for a=\r\n student of the second\n&gt; &gt; Ishiguro Mastasune who died ca. 1800.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Th=\r\ne photos are a bit blurry - or maybe it&#39;s my eyes - and I&#39;m no\n&gt; &gt; authorit=\r\ny on the signature. There should be examples in Wakayama \nthat\n&gt; &gt; someone =\r\ncan look up, my copies are in the warehouse.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --\n&gt; &gt; Craig Harri=\r\ns\n&gt; &gt; Books from and about Asia\n&gt; &gt; www.bridgeofdreams.com\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nOn 1/18/06, excelsiorilluminati &lt;excelsiorilluminati@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;   \n&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; Hi All, Could someone tell me more about Masamori of Ishiguro \nschool.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt; I&#39;m told there were three.
