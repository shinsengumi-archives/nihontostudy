Swords aren&#39;t an\nexact science by any means as I found out recently, a few years ago I bought\nan o-suriage mumei blade I was sure was by Motoshige, when it went for\nshinsa it made Tokubetsu Hozon as Bitchu Aoe! I thought then I should give\nup swords and collect stamps, however three months ago it made Juyo as\nMotoshige!

It is one of the best Yamato blades\n&gt; I&#39;ve seen. I don&#39;t normally go in for Yamato, but I felt that it was\n&gt; just an exemplary sword, filled with dignity, and the koshirae also I\n&gt; felt was very nice.\n&gt;\n&gt; So it is my sole Yamato study piece for the medium future. I&#39;m curious\n&gt; in that they had it marked as a Nambokucho blade, but I feel that it\n&gt; could possibly be Kamakura.
