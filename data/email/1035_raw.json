Token and kodogu are hard enough, but the koshirae worksheet descriptions are going to be a monster challenge.  Edo period machibori kodogu kantei is also going to take a lot of work.  I don&#39;t know about four years but it sure is motivating.\n\nJim \n\n\n\n  Hi Jim,\n\n  You&#39;re welcome. Maybe soon we can have katakana on our fittings \n  kanteisho!! Since this information didn&#39;t go out on this list, let me \n  add that kenkyu-in is the first step to becoming a member of the shinsa \n  team. All of the members of the present team went through the ranks. \n  The next step is shinsa-in hosa, which means an assistant to the shinsa \n  team. Assistants should fill out the working papers -- in Japanese. I \n  could somewhat manage this, but in the end, I was given a break. The \n  third stage is full shinsa team member. This all typically takes about \n  four years or so from kenkyu-in to full shinsa team member.\n\n  I will also try and scan a photo of Choshu-ya&#39;s koshirae. I don&#39;t think \n  it sold.\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
