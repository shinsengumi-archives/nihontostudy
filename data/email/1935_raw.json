You mentioned Yasutoshi but I don&#39;t believe you mentioned it being in Slough&#39;s book. I&#39;ll have to check that out. \n\nI may be using the sample sometime in the near future. I&#39;m doing a one-case display at our downtown Soldiers Memorial museum this summer. Inspecting it for the first time the other day and talking to the director, he asked if I would be interested in doing a talk for a city &quot;rich man&#39;s club&quot; organization. A little out of my league (and the director&#39;s), I said yes. It would be a good opportunity to show the tamahagane. If nothing happens in the near future, I&#39;ll get the sample back to you. \n\nRon\n\n\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: Bob Elder \n  To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Tuesday, June 15, 2004 9:26 AM\n  Subject: Re: [nihontostudy] testing only\n\n\n  Hi Ron. Couldn&#39;t remember if I told you but the\n  tamahagane I sent you is from Yasutoshi and is\n  pictured in John Slough&#39;s book on pages 192/193. I\n  have video of that visit where he showed us a part if\n  the process up to the first few folds. Anyway, Bob\n  Elder\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
