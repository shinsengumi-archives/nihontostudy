The first generation&#39;s iron plate is just outstanding, even if the decoration is not to your taste.  I was really surprised when I first handled one in Japan because it was something I never &quot;got&quot; from the illustrations I had looked at.\n\nStudying Jingo tsuba outside of Japan is tough since the overwhelming majority of pieces we have are later work that really isn&#39;t very good and does not give any sense of the quality of the first work.\n\nThe style of the brass suemon zogan decoration does take some getting used to.  It&#39;s probably not for everyone, but definitely try to see a top example in person if you can.  What do you think of Hirata Hikozo&#39;s work in copper, for example?  Or Raku, Shino and Oribe pottery?\n\nJim \n\n\n\n  Can anyone explain why Jingo tsuba are so sought after? They always strike me as being a bit crude and not very interesting, often decorated with an eagle or other beast that looks, well, kind of retarded. Is there any specific reason why these pieces have the status they do? After spending hours looking at pictures of them, I still fail to see where the (artistic) merit is. \n\n  I admit to not having handled any genuine examples personally (since they are pretty rare), so perhaps these tsuba convey something in the handling that they do not in the pix?\n\n  Matt\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
