There are also the formal Edo period mounts you mention with horn kashira.  Not only loss, but damage affected kashira more than fuchi.  Kashira were also more likely to be turned into rings, pendants and bracelet links.  Fuchi are also easily removed from tsuka and separated from the tied down kashira.  That&#39;s all I can think of at the moment.  Not sure if it&#39;s enough to account for the f/k imbalance.\n\nJim \n\n\n\n  Maybe it&#39;s been discussed before (forgive my atrophing brain),\n  but why are there so many  single, unmatched fuchi around?\n  I know there was a period of formal wear that used horn\n  kashira and of course being on the end of the tsuka, the\n  kashira are more easily lost, but still it seems there are\n  way too many odd fuchi around.\n\n  Any speculations as to why?\n\n  Rich S\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
