I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve seen one lacquered like that before.\n\nDeer and maple leaves are a fairly common autumn motif.  More specifically deer are associated with one of the principle deities at Kasuga jinja in Nara.  There are a lot of deer at Kasuga shrine and elsewhere in Nara that are rounded up in the fall to have their antlers sawn off.  So, I think that the antler with the maple branches and leaves was intended to evoke Kasuga jinja in particular, the hills around Nara and autumn in general.\n\nI checked Google for Kasuga jinja links - this site touches on the deer: \nhttp://fischer.jinkan.kyoto-u.ac.jp/soramitsu/DivineDeer.html\n\nMilt, I think that it is an antler at the bottom left (looking at the front view) below the kozuka ana.  The rest are maple branches.\nJim\n\n\n\n\n  Hi Jim, group - \n\n  A tsuba I&#39;ve got on Ebay right now--Kyo-Shoami, most likely--has the motif of &quot;maple leaves and a deer antler&quot; represented on it.  Somebody just asked me about the meaning of this design and I realized, I have no idea.  Can any of you comment on what this motif represents?  \n\n  http://tinyurl.com/dpws \n\n  Also, I&#39;ve always found it curious to have the remnants of lacquer remaining on the leaves.  Jim, you might have handles this tsuba awhile back when we last talked, I&#39;m not sure.  Interesting to see this treatment.  Comments welcomed!\n\n  Ron\n  STL\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
