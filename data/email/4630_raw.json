Off the top of a \nnewbie&#39;s =\r\nhead: Naminohira, Kunikane, outside possibility of Gassan \nif you happen to=\r\n see any spots of ayasugi hada. Hope this points you \nin the right directio=\r\nn. \n\nRicky \n\n\n--- In nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com, &quot;dwmac2000&quot; &lt;dwmac2000@.=\r\n..&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hello,  Recently purchased a sword which was in a closet wr=\r\napped \nin a \n&gt; blanket for the last 60+ years.  It has a Shin gunto tsuka a=\r\nnd a \nolder \n&gt; appearing Kyo-sukashi tsuba.  The blade is a bit &quot;rough&quot; but=\r\n still \nhas \n&gt; very visible hada.  The hamon appears to be Suguha for the m=\r\nost \npart.\n&gt; The hada is very prominant, it seems to be a Itame/Mokume mix =\r\nwith \n&gt; Masame near the ha.  The Masame hada also can be clearly seen \nthro=\r\nugh \n&gt; the kissaki.  The sword is unsigned with a osujikai yasurime. The \n&gt;=\r\n nakago condition appears ( a guess ) approx. 1800-1860.  I&#39;m \nthinking \n&gt; =\r\na late Edo copy of an Koto Yamato.  Nagasa 65cm, machi width 3.1 \ncm, \n&gt; yo=\r\nkote 2.1 cm, sori 1.5 cm.  Do these characteristics suggest to \n&gt; anyone a =\r\nparticular Shinshinto School, Smith or Province. I know \nit \n&gt; would be dif=\r\nficult with or without blade in hand, but any advice \nor \n&gt; information wou=\r\nld be appreciated.   Thanks.....\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n"
