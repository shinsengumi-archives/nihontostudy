It appears to be a Japanese sword with some years on it.  \nThe scabbard is wooden and covered with leather, yet well worn.  The \nsword itself has no identifying marks on it.  The handle has been \nunwrapped and is bare wood.  I have looked on the internet, but have \ndecided that all of this is more than my mind alone can handle,  I \nneed some help. \n\n\n"
