Might as well advertise them here.\n\nTosogu No Kansho by Masayuki Sasano (1982).  A great reference book with  \nEnglish descriptions and nice photography of both iron and kinko  tosogu.  A \nvery good reference to have in your library. \n\nhttp://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c52/kamakiri/books/tnokansho.jpg\nhttp://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c52/kamakiri/books/tnokanshoopen.jpg PRICE $95  \n\n\nTsuba  Kodogu Kantei Nyumon By Iida & Wakayama (2000).
