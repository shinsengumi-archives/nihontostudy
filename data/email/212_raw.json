In Fuji=\r\nshiro&#39;s, they place the Shodai in Genna ( 1615 ) and the Nidai in Kanban ( =\r\n1661 ) They also have a yamato no daijo masanori listed in Kan&#39;ei ( 1624 ) =\r\nwho may or may not be the Nidia. There would seem to be quite a bit of diff=\r\nerence in time between 1624 and 1661, I mean buy that, he would have either=\r\n been pretty young if he was in fact the smith working in 1623 or pretty ol=\r\nd when listed as the Nidai. \n\n  I then also have volume 47 of Token Shibata=\r\n which has an excellent example of the Shodai&#39;s work in it and it places it=\r\n at Keich=F4 ( 1596 )\n\n  Does anyone have any clarification on when the Sho=\r\ndai and Nidai worked ?, and does Fujishiro&#39;s date them according to title. =\r\ni.e. the Nidai received the Daijo title in 1661 so that is the date Fujishi=\r\nro listed him from.\n\n  cheers all\n\n  Rich T\n\n\n\n\n  [Non-text portions of thi=\r\ns message have been removed]\n\n\n        Yahoo!
