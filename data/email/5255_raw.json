It is a pleasant design of a pine tree. A\ndesign I like alot.\n\nI was away in Connecticut for a while and did not have\naccess to my books. Hitting the Owari to Mikawa no\nTanko (aka the big blue Owari book), I noted a similar\none signed and dated 1851 by Norisuke the 1st. It is\nusually the last one listed in any book, as I believe\nit is the latest date at which he was known to have\nmade a tsuba.\n\nGiven that these guys were fairly prolific:\n   I expected to eventually find some other joint\nworks. A list member even loaned me the Norisuke book.\nThere are no joint works in there or any other\nreference I have opened.\n\nTo me the workmanship of the tsuba looks like that of\nIwata Norisuke. But the signature on the front is Niwa\nNorisuke.\n   So maybe Iwata Norisuke made it and his teacher\nsigned it- or a fun but much less likely possibility\n(remember that these are master forgers) Iwata\nNorisuke forged his teacher&#39;s signature? Unlikely, but\ngiven the marked similarity of their signatures- fun\nto imagine.\n\nAny recommendations who would be best in Japan to ask\nabout this tsuba?\n\nCurran\n\n\n\n--- Jim Gilbert &lt;jggilbert@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; Curran,\n&gt; I haven&#39;t seen one illustrated or in person. \n&gt; Jointly signed works are very uncommon in fittings. \n&gt; Most examples that I can think of are where the\n&gt; plate was prepared by one person and the decoration\n&gt; applied by another.  \n&gt; \n&gt;  It&#39;d be an interesting study to assemble a group\n&gt; (even photos) of jointly signed pieces of any type.\n&gt; \n&gt; Jim\n&gt; \n&gt; http://www.jimgilbertphoto.com/\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Dear Lists,\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ve been reading and researching Norisuke I &\n&gt; Norisuke II for a while. There is a good bit of\n&gt; information on them in Art & Sword Vol. 3, the Owari\n&gt; Tsuba book, and even a book dedicated entirely to\n&gt; their work and that of a few of their students.\n&gt; \n&gt; Question: Has anyone ever seen a tsuba signed by\n&gt; both Gen1 (&#39;Niwa&#39; Norisuke) and by Gen2 (&#39;Iwata&#39;\n&gt; Norisuke)?\n&gt; I would think there would be more than a few, as\n&gt; their lives overlapped a good bit.\n&gt; \n&gt; There are no joint signed examples in the books, so\n&gt; I&#39;m hoping someone has seen or owns a joint work.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thank you in advance,\n&gt; \n&gt; Curran\n&gt; \n&gt;\n__________________________________________________________\n&gt; Never miss a thing.
