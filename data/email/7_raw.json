I remember reading that the tsuba size changed when fighting went from one handed mounted to two handed ground fighting. There are several nice smaller cast pieces in this book that are from the nambokucho period. There is also a very nice red lacquer that was a used by certain Priests I believe that loos spectacular. I will research this more later in the day and respond with proper information.\n&gt;\n&gt;cheers\n&gt;\n&gt;Rich Turner\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;---\n&gt;Outgoing mail is certified Virus Free.\n&gt;Checked by AVG anti-virus system (http://www.grisoft.com).\n&gt;Version: 6.0.471 / Virus Database: 269 - Release Date: 10/04/2003\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt;nihontostudy-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;\n&gt;Your use of Yahoo!
