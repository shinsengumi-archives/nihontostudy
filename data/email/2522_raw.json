It&#39;s an interesting interlocking set of motifs.\n\nI very much doubt that there was a fukurin or that the chiseling is a secret mark.  I think it&#39;s just to add decorative interest to the rim.  Worm eaten / rotten wood decorative devices like that were popular with the Umetada and Shoami as well as others to give an aged/rustic feeling.\n\nJim\n\n\n\n  please klick..........\n\n  http://tinyurl.com/67wjy\n\n\n  Just acquired this iron katana size tsuba.\n  Motif is that of rabbit with mallet set against a full moon.\n  It is signed Umetada Shichizaemon Tachibana ( ? ) Shigeyoshi saku.\n  a mid-edo period tsuba maker  .\n  The flip side shows a crescent moon with waves.\n  Interesting thing is that the moon is overlay with VERY THIN silver \n  nunome now darken to same color as the iron plate.  The &quot; bumps &quot; on \n  the moon surface, I believe, represents that mythical tree.\n\n  Along the rim are &quot; chisel marks &quot;  ( can be seen in one of the \n  pic ), there are 6 on each side.\n  Question ........... are these marks for retention of a soft metal \n  rim now missing  ? or are they &quot; secret &quot; identity marks of the tsuba \n  maker ?\n\n  milt\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
