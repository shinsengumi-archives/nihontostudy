Hence\nit is possible it was an older (but not much older)\nwakizashi which had the tang reworked and a false\nsignature added. With the sword market hitting rock\nbottom during those times, it would have been probably\neasier and/or cheaper to rework an unsigned wakizashi\nthan go to the trouble of classically constructing\none. Hence a famous name was added.\n\nIt is unlikely the blade merits the monetary expense\nof polish, but you can learn from it. The tsuba is a\nnice little Higo province type thing, and has some\nminor value to it.\n\nI live in Florida and am a wee bit East Coast centric,\nso regretably I do not know any sword clubs in\nArizona. Several fittings collectors live out that\nway. I believe the moderator of this list (Jim\nGilbert) also lived in Arizona for a while and might\nbe able to direct you to local people that can tell\nyou more about the wakizashi.\n    My first Nihonto was a wakizashi very similar to\nyours. I wish I&#39;d kept the menuki from it. Not\nvaluable, but very unique. I&#39;ve never seen another\npair like them.\n\nWelcome to Nihonto!\n\nCurran\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--- bh325 &lt;bh325@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; Curran,\n&gt; \n&gt; Thank you for your reply.

If it is not possible or\n&gt; practical\n&gt; &gt; to take a picture, you might consider taking it to\n&gt; a\n&gt; &gt; sword club near you.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Given the size and curvature of the blade, it is\n&gt; &gt; probably a wakizashi or a naginata-naoshi (a\n&gt; halberd\n&gt; &gt; like weapon that has been cut down to make an\n&gt; oversize\n&gt; &gt; tanto. &quot;O-tanto&quot; basically is a large or oversized\n&gt; &gt; tanto). The mounts sound fine to me. Many of these\n&gt; &gt; came back as souevinirs with WW2 veterans. As they\n&gt; &gt; played with them over the years, parts &lt;handles,\n&gt; &gt; seppas, etc&gt; got mixed and matched.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Don&#39;t mess with the blade using any cleaning\n&gt; &gt; chemicals. Despite the polish being gone and the\n&gt; edge\n&gt; &gt; destroyed, there may be some life left to it.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Please share in what state or country you live,\n&gt; and we\n&gt; &gt; will try to point you to a nearby sword society or\n&gt; &gt; club.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Curran\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?
