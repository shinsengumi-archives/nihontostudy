The Minoto Taikan \nhad a\n&gt; small sized oshigata and that compared very well. Even better was \nNihonto\n&gt; Zuikan -- yes, if you do not have this set of books, you will \nnever know\n&gt; what you have. There were two, first gen. oshigata here and they \nboth\n&gt; matched very well, particularly the katana oshigata. So, my call --\n genuine\n&gt; signature of 1st. gen. Shinano no Kami Daido, circa Kanei.\n&gt; \n&gt; Gordon\n&gt;   -----Original Message-----\n&gt;   From: Ron Polansky [mailto:yamabrp@i...]\n&gt;   Sent: Monday, May 05, 2003 11:34 PM\n&gt;   To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;   Subject: [nihontostudy] Mino Daido\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   All:\n&gt; \n&gt;   I was wondering if someone had a Mino Taikon that had a matching \nmei:\n&gt;   Shinano (no) Kami Fujiwara Daido\n&gt;   http://www.nihontophile.com/Daido1.jpg (nakago rubbing)\n&gt;   http://www.nihontophile.com/Daido2.jpg (picture of blade)\n&gt;   (hada is tighter than most Mino I have seen)\n&gt; \n&gt;   I was wondering which generation?\n&gt;   (judging by the sori, etc., I was guessing 1st generation...blade\n&gt;   looks early Shinto)\n&gt; \n&gt;   Thanks for the help!\n&gt;   Ron\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;         Yahoo!
