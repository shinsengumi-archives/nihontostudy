According to the Meikan the first generation worked in  \nEdo but this particular signature (place name) is not given. So it  \nmay be a unique signature.\n\tCould he have forged this within the castle as diversion for his  \nlord or others? Could it have been for one of the sword-making  \ncontests known to have taken place at the Shoguns behest. Was he on  \nduty (bivouac-ed) at the castle but forged this at the Kaga mansion  \nor some other spot in the castle-town? I think it raises some  \nintriguing questions and is a good subject of study.\n\tAs for preserving it, &quot;every sword deserves a good polish&quot;, and if  \nthey made it this far it is up to us to preserve them, if we cannot  \nget the best polish available then it is incumbent on us to stop any  \ndeterioration, and keep it in as is condition for future generations  \nto restore.\nMHO\n-t\n\n"
