You have provided part of the answer yourself\nby saying &quot;rare&quot; though of course that begs the question, why rare?\nJingo tsuba were made in Higo and the work of the first three\ngenerations is considered particularly fine, thereafter as in most lines\nfollowing generations could not stop adding gold and silver effects,\nbecoming too symmetric, adopting features from other groups, etc.\n Higo, being remote from Edo, tended to supply products in the kodogu\narea, as with swords, that were somewhat outside the mainstream and they\ntended to be somewhat aloof from fashion elsewhere and to maintain that\ndifference longer than other groups. Their market was more the samurai\nand less the merchant than would be true for people supplying the market\nin Edo and Osaka. The first three developed naturalistic designs never\nseen before or since, and thereby reflected the wabi sabi aesthetic that\nwas very influential, particularly with the more severe samurai in the\nearly Edo period. Their designs are very three dimensional, tastefully\naccented with gold and silver. Their most complementary counterpart\nseems to be found in the work of the Kanayama which, while sukashi, have\nthe same rustic, subtle and unpretentious character. People also wonder\nwhey they tend to go for some serious money. Jingo tsuba are instantly\nrecognizable and fit well with any severe koshirae.\n Just a stab.\n Arnold\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; matthewhoyle@... 06/19/04 7:49 PM &gt;&gt;&gt;\nCan anyone explain why Jingo tsuba are so sought after? They always\nstrike me as being a bit crude and not very interesting, often decorated\nwith an eagle or other beast that looks, well, kind of retarded. Is\nthere any specific reason why these pieces have the status they do?\nAfter spending hours looking at pictures of them, I still fail to see\nwhere the (artistic) merit is. \n\nI admit to not having handled any genuine examples personally (since\nthey are pretty rare), so perhaps these tsuba convey something in the\nhandling that they do not in the pix?\n\nMatt\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n\n \nYahoo!
