Jim&#39;s lecture and exhibition of Akasaka tsuba is \ngreaaa=\r\ntttttttttttt ( quoting Tony the tiger, god bless his soul ).The \nNBTHK over=\r\nsea branch exhitbition of swords and kantei ( open to all ) \nis excellent. =\r\nI did not attempt the kantei as I don&#39;t want to \nembarrass myself even thou=\r\ngh i would hit one right on ( the owner \ntold me  his juyo Ko-Mihara would =\r\nbe there ). Then there&#39;s the \noshigata lesson, the demonstration of the cla=\r\ny thingie on swords ( \nhey, i am more of a fitting guy, can&#39;t recall the pr=\r\noper sword term \nanymore ) etc......\n\n Buying and selling................. =\r\nbuyers&#39; market, no question \nabout it !!\nIf you carry cash and ready to par=\r\nt with them, great bargains \neverywhere !!\nProblem is most are freaking che=\r\nap................ or they all drop \ntheir loads\nby Hagrid&#39;s ( aka the big =\r\nguy Mark walberg ) table who has boxes and \nboxes ( I kid you\nnot ) of kodo=\r\ngu of the highest calibre ( and the price , though high, \nis\nreasonable ).\n=\r\nMantis dude, i took a pic of a mantis tsuba from Hagrid&#39;s table just \nfor\ny=\r\nou...............I think the asking price is in the mid 2k.\nI personally ma=\r\nrked my tsuba below retail and managed to sell only \ntwo tsuba\nin the highe=\r\nr mid range level and traded away a bunch of low end \ntsuba for\nsomethings =\r\nI can live with. So i consider the show as &quot; slow &quot; but I \ndo know\na friend=\r\n sold a few high end tsuba so the show is good in his \nprospective.\n\nFoods.=\r\n.................. the exhibitor&#39;s dinner on Saturday can only \nbe\ndescribe=\r\nd as &quot; strange &quot;.............\nI wonder how our dear friends from Deustchlan=\r\nd enjoyed the true &quot; \nsouthern\ncooking &quot; that include black eye peas und co=\r\nllar greens !!??\n\nJss/us business................ at least 10 new collector=\r\ns signed up \nas new\nmembers at the show all due to the effort of one diecto=\r\nr from Canada \n( in\nmatters of hours ) !!\nThe society will be publishing Yo=\r\nshikawa Sensei&#39;s writing ( \ntranslated by\nProf. Gordon Robson ) in 3 volume=\r\ns all priced at cost !!\nAn excellent article by our John Berta on Onin tsub=\r\na will be \npublished in\nthe upcoming journal, on top of that out dear frien=\r\nd from Deustchland \nHans has\n, most generously , gave us permission to repr=\r\nint his article on Yagyu\ntsuba. Considered what he ate on Saturday night, I=\r\n wondered how he \ncan still\nbe\nso nice..............may be it&#39;s because I p=\r\nersonally asked him ? Or \nmay be he\nhad private dinner with carl who told m=\r\ne he had lobster with wine \nsauce\nprepared just for him at the hotel ?? Arr=\r\nrrrrrrrrhhhhhhhhhh, life is\nsoooooooooooo unfair !!\n\nthat&#39;s about all I can=\r\n think about just now.\nFor the &quot; serious version &quot; of the event, wait for t=\r\nhe Ombudsman&#39;s \nreport.\n\np.s. also learned a new trick from one of the old =\r\ntimer...... when \nchecking Goto school kozuka, run your finger nail under t=\r\nhe &quot; \npicture &quot; side of the opening......if it catches, not a good sign.\n\n\n=\r\n\n\nmilt\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
