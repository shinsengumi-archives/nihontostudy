I find it necessary to keep a list of the titles I\nown\n      (senility) to keep from ordering duplicates, and when I was entering\nthis\n      book on my list, I found no publisher, place, or date of publication\n    listed.\n\n      My impression is that the JSS/US was the publisher, is that correct?\nMr.\n      Robson refers to &quot;an auspicious day&quot; in 1997.  This just appeared, did\nit\n      not?\n\n      What, by the way, is the Japanese for &quot;auspicious day?&quot;\n\n\n\n            Yahoo!
