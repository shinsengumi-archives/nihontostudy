And swords were among the list of Japanese \ncontributions=\r\n. In return China had Japanese delegate brought home \nmuch much more than t=\r\nhey gave. I did not invent stories like this. \nChinese history had had ampl=\r\ne records about them. I would believe \nthat in Tokyo palace vault there are=\r\n tremendous number of treasury \nthat once were gifts from Chinese emperors.=\r\n They must have been well \ndocumented. Japanese gives and takes. I wish som=\r\neday Chinese \nfriendship contributions could be made possible for all to se=\r\ne. \nNow, why am I so sure that the captioned tsuba was made in Japan? \nApar=\r\nt from material, workmanship and style in general, the most \nobvious point =\r\nin focus is the mustach of the dragon. The dragon on \nthis tsuba is thick w=\r\nith mustach. That is what so unique about it. \nPlease try to take a strong =\r\nview on Meiji silver one-yen coin. The \nJapanese dragon design on the said =\r\ncoin is thick with mustach, too. \nThere should be no one challenge the auth=\r\nenticity of Japanese dragon \non Japanese one-yen Meiji silver coin. In case=\r\n of Chinese dragon, \nthe dragons are mustach free since Ming and Ching dyna=\r\nsty. \nInteresting parties will please visit two web pages listed below. \nTh=\r\ney are equally authentically emperial style in China. Please note \nthe drag=\r\nons there. No mustach.\nhttp://www.wallcoo.com/photograph/chinese_culture/ht=\r\nml/image50.html\nhttp://tya.myrime.com/cgi-bin/view.cgi?forum=3D5&topic=3D29=\r\n63\nI would like to suggest something here. The implication of my \nfinding p=\r\noint out an interesting direction for tsuba collectors to \npursue. Some tsu=\r\nbas used to bear a mission of introducing things \nJapan to foreign people. =\r\nJapan was on the rice during Meiji period. \nThey were eager to introduce th=\r\nemselves to the world. Next time when \nyou are about to make a choice of co=\r\nllection take a strong view and \nthink. Is this tsuba specially made with p=\r\neople like me in mind? If \nyou do then you hold a mysterious key that could=\r\n open a cross time \ndialog with the original creator far away and long ago =\r\nin a country \ncall Japan.  \n\nHappy New Year.\n\nYing-Chaw\nTaipei\n\n--- In niho=\r\nntostudy@yahoogroups.com, Tom Helm &lt;junkmail@t...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Ying-Chaw-\n&gt; =\r\n\tIt is an interesting possibility.
