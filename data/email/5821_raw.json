Bonhams in=\r\n England quoted me a price of 141 english pounds\nto ship 1 regular tsuba. I=\r\n got a quote from mailbox etc which is around 100 and\nthat is still disgust=\r\ning. I know it costs about $20 usd say around 15 pounds\nto ship. I emailed =\r\nwhen I got the original quote and said you must be\nmistaken. They said that=\r\n quote is correct, they use an outside vendor but the\nitem will be delivere=\r\nd to my doorstop. where else would it be delivered to? I\nfigured at those p=\r\nrices if they have 5-6 customers in NY they could actually\nsend a person by=\r\n plane to hand deliver. I am debating what to do, but since I\nhaven&#39;t gotte=\r\nn a response back asking to speak to a person in charge, it looks\nlike I wo=\r\nn&#39;t be a customer of theirs ever again. I am a strong believer in\nproviding=\r\n customer service but when an action like this occurs, it just shows me\nthe=\r\ny don&#39;t really care. 3rd party or not you as a company are responsible for\n=\r\nthe entire experience. If they chose the vendor, it is still part of their\n=\r\nservice. I am just amazed at how much of a ripoff is being allowed to go on=\r\n.\nSo be warned and be careful, a company I thought was reputable is a place=\r\n I\ndon&#39;t think is acting in a reputable manner.\n\nHope all of you have bette=\r\nr experiences.\nKen\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n=\r\n________________________________\nThis transmission contains information fro=\r\nm the law firm of Whiteford, Taylor & Preston LLP which may be confidential=\r\n and/or privileged.
