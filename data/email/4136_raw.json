Life-like as those by Ishiguro school ?\n  So.......... why is it so highly treasured ?  Because the birds are \n  ugly ?  Or because they say it is &quot; good &quot; and so it is....... ?( sort \n  of like there&#39;s WMD because i said there  is ?  =)   )\n\n  p.s.  the hawk is gold ( not paint ), not copper/brass based as it \n  doesn&#39;t stain with &quot; magic solution &quot; that stain copper/brass, yes, i \n  tried.\n\n\n  milt\n\n\n\n\n\n  SPONSORED LINKS Buy fine art  Japanese incense  Fine art inkjet paper  \n        Fine art printing  Fine art appraisal  Japanese print  \n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  YAHOO!
