They&#39;re accomplices to the sale. Every fake sold means\nmoney in Ebay&#39;s pocket. If you turn on the lights while the thief and\nhis accomplice are robbing your house, the accomplice suddenly turns\ninto a vigilante and is glad to help you catch the thief... \n\nThat&#39;s the one and only reason Ebay doesn&#39;t do anything about it.\n\nOn the flip side of the coin...\n\nThere is a saying, &quot;It&#39;s impossible to cheat an honest man.&quot;\n\nEveryone on Ebay wants to get a steal. They want to buy your item for\nless than it is worth, and if you ask a fair price few will go to\nyou. They will flock to those that appear to be offering discounted\nitems though, often times cutting deals outside of ebay, and all they do\nis screw themselves. Their own greed means they end up with these\nvalueless pieces of junk. \n\nEven armed with a little information, if they see someone who doesn&#39;t\nappear to know what they&#39;re selling, how many of them send an email and\nsay, &quot;Hey dude, that junky violin you found in your grandpa&#39;s attic is\nreally a Stradivarius. You should get it authenticated and sell it at\nSotheby&#39;s, pay off your mortgage and be able to send your kid to a good\nuniversity.&quot;\n\nVery few.\n\nSo when you go out of your way to inform them, often times you take away\nthe mystery and the treasure hunting mentality takes them\nelsewhere. Right into the hands of the scammers.\n\nThey want to buy something from you of extreme value, and not pay for\nit. So they find someone who looks like they&#39;re providing this to them. \n\nIt&#39;s not only with swords, but it&#39;s with diamonds... other gemstones,\nwatches, everything. I sold some gold coins once, and I had no end of\npeople offering to do me a favor and give me 20% *less* than the market\nprice of gold if I would sell to them now and end the auction.\n\nGold is the one thing that has a well understood value in the world, and\neven on ebay auctions will end at the market price of gold\nconsistently. The price of gold is less a reflection on the value of\ngold then it is on the value of paper money. \n\nThese people were effectively offering me 80 cents if I would give them\na dollar bill. There is no mentality there for a fair deal, just a hope\nthat they can get something for less than it is valued.\n\nFor both reasons above, junk will continue to be put on ebay and the\nauctions will be well attended. People will buy first and ask questions\nlater. And ebay will turn a blind eye to everything.\n\n- darcy\n\n&lt;saemonjonosuke@...&gt; writes:\n\n&gt; Hi,\n&gt; It is getting more &#39;funny&#39; with this Chinese &#39;dealers&#39; on Ebay.\n&gt; 2 weeks ago I put a tsuba from Mastsugu on Ebay,, many people watch \n&gt; and bid on it.\n\n&gt; But now,,, some Chinese dealer copy my title and discription and put \n&gt; it on his 3 *^#@ tsuba&#39;s......\n&gt; Please see these items.\n\n&gt; Item number: 2578865338 / 2578866848 / 2578869530 \n \n&gt; I don&#39;t understand that Ebay doesn&#39;t do anything about this.\n\n&gt; John\n\n\n\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; nihontostudy-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n\n \n\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
