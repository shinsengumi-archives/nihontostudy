One day I will\nmake a show!  As rumors to another shinsa in NY, will\nit be just shinsa or is there a chance at a show?  For\nthose that went, what was it like last time, were\nthere any buying/trading opportunities?  People\nnetworking etc? When I moved to Maryland, I thought I\nwould be able to make NY shows (I&#39;m from there).  Of\ncourse they stopped having them the year I got close. \nAt least I have a token kai to go to 1hr 45 mins away\nnow even if it kills me.\n\nThanks.\nKen\n\n--- John Berta &lt;johnberta@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; Hey Ken; \n&gt; \n&gt; Go easy on poor Milt, I like buying his tsuba makes\n&gt; great ballast in the bilge of the sail boat.\n&gt; \n&gt; John\n&gt;   ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt;   From: Kenneth Wilson \n&gt;   To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n&gt;   Sent: Friday, December 23, 2005 9:13 AM\n&gt;   Subject: RE: [nihontostudy] Where do you buy your\n&gt; Tsuba?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   Mark,\n&gt; \n&gt;   I don&#39;t travel, just send me the lobster and bear\n&gt;   eh?!!

Apart from that, I usually don&#39;t\n&gt; get\n&gt;   &gt; state side. I can just see\n&gt;   &gt; &gt;myself trying to explain to a customs officer\n&gt; that\n&gt;   &gt; I&#39;m travelling to the\n&gt;   &gt; &gt;U.S. to attend a Japanese Sword Show! LOL!
