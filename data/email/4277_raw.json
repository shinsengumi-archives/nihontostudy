I will \nhave to=\r\n look into finding the catalog.  \nI just came upon this information today a=\r\nnd it coincides with your \nquestion.  It is from &#39;Kodogu&#39; pg. 20, by Gunthe=\r\nr Heckmann\n\n&#39;Until a few years ago it was generally agreed that sword decor=\r\nations \nof this sort were produced by the Ainu, the native inhabitants of \n=\r\nJapan&#39;s northern island Ezo, which is nowadays called Hokkaido.  For \nthis =\r\nreason these sort of objects are usually called Ezo koshirae.  \nBecause of =\r\nthe fact that the Ainu did not have a deep knowledge of \nmetal processing, =\r\nwe should rather use the term Shoki Kinko, &#39;the \nfirst kinko period&#39;, for t=\r\nhis type of work.  Other ideas about the \norigin of these objects can be or=\r\niented from the beginnings of the \nfire gilding technique in China, during =\r\nthe T&#39;ang dynesty (618-906), \nand the possible use of imported Chinese bron=\r\nze for the production of \nsword decoration.\nThe basic metal used for these =\r\nobjects is different from the metal \nusually used for sword decoration.  An=\r\n examination of the metal \ncontent of this pair of menuki was performed in =\r\nApril 1996, by Prof. \nDr. Richter of the Institut fur technologie der Maler=\r\nei, in \nStuttgart, using LASER micro spectral analysis and atomic absorptio=\r\nn \nspectral anallysis.   The main componenets of the metal in this \nobject =\r\nare 70% copper, 25% silver, and the remaining 5% shows traces \nof lead, gol=\r\nd, mercury iron, calcium magnesium, aluninum, and \nsilicon.  The gold and m=\r\nercury derive from the fire gilding.  The \nother contents can be taced to t=\r\nhe partially refined copper.  An \nalloy of 25% silver and 75% copper is oft=\r\nen used for Japanese sword \ndecoration and is called oborogin.  With a high=\r\ner percentage of \nsilver to copper the alloy is called rogin or more common=\r\nly \nshibuichi.  For the outome of the alloy, it is important to know that \n=\r\nwhen silver is added to copper in these quantities, it tends to rise \nto th=\r\ne surface, which is the reason for the silvery appearance of the \nShoki Kin=\r\nko pieces.  It is not clear yet why especially this alloy \nwas used for swo=\r\nrd decoration at such an early time.  These objects \nare mostly deated from=\r\n the early to middle Muromachi period (1400 - \n1450), sometimes even earlie=\r\nr.  Shibuichi was always considered to be \na metal of the Edo period, but t=\r\nhe date of origin of oborogin is \nunknown.  Further analyses of the so coal=\r\nled Shoki Kinko decarations \nare necessary before any conclusion can be mad=\r\ne about the components \nof these sword fittings.  With this first analyses =\r\nan important and \nstimulating step was made towards further studies of this=\r\n subject.\n\nButtweiler in his writing stated he felt the dark color under th=\r\ne \ngilding may have been due to the effect of mercury on the copper in \ncom=\r\nbination with the gold creating a layer of &#39;shakudo&#39; and this \neffect may h=\r\nave led t it&#39;s discovery as an alloy.  (This gilding was \npost probably don=\r\ne by making a slurry paste of gold filings and \nmercury and then heat evapo=\r\nrating the mercury leaving the gold layer).\n\nNote:  link to picture of Ezo =\r\nfitting used in the book:\n\nhttp://ph.groups.yahoo.com/group/nihontostudy/ph=\r\notos/view/7936?b=3D2\n\n\n\n-- In nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Alan Bale&quot; &lt;ab=\r\nale@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Regarding Ezo menuki I think that these were not suri-h=\r\negashi inlay \nbut genuinely worn pieces. Something that has puzzled me for =\r\na long \ntime is that many Ezo menuki I have seen have a silvery metal base =\r\n\nnot unlike shibuichi but the books always say &#39;yamagane&#39;,  but I have \nnev=\r\ner seen this silvery metal on anything other than Ezo items.\n&gt; Alan\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n=\r\n&gt;   SPONSORED LINKS Buy fine art  Japanese translation  Japanese \nincense  =\r\n\n&gt;         Fine art inkjet paper  Fine art printing  Fine art \nappraisal  \n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; -------------------------------------------------------------------=\r\n-\n----------\n&gt;   YAHOO!
