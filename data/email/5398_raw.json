Typically,\nI&#39;ve seen these pieces coming from the Tokugawa\ndomains, either Edo (the mimi-zogan is characteristic\nof the Edo Bushu Ito school) or Hitachi.  You&#39;ve got a\nslightly unusual design here because it looks like it\nmight have a bit of influence from the Higo Hayashi\nschool as well (I&#39;m thinking of the shape and\npositioning of the larger branches, but the carving is\ndefinitely Bushu-Ito style as is the mimi-zogan. Not\nreally surprising to see these little cross-style\ntechniques creep in because of the Sankin-Kotai.  It&#39;s\nobviously a high-class piece and my guess is that it\nwas probably custom made for one particular sword and\ndid not go the typical route of a gazillion remounts\nlike the more typical trade-goods tsuba.\n\nCheers,\n\nPhil\n\n\n\n\n--- Ron Hartmann &lt;swords@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; Hi all - \n&gt; \n&gt; What is the Japanese name (term) for sunken relief\n&gt; carved design on tsuba? I&#39;m talking about the design\n&gt; being made by carving the plate surface away. The\n&gt; tsuba I&#39;m looking at has been posted under photos...\n&gt; \n&gt; http://tinyurl.com/2jq42a\n&gt; \n&gt; and shows a 24-petal kiku sukashi where the petals\n&gt; are rounded down below the surface of the rim and\n&gt; overall plate. (In this case, the tsuba is actually\n&gt; tapered, the flat edge being 1 mm less than the\n&gt; seppa-dai surface.) In the Boston book Ogawa called\n&gt; this sukidashi takabori  in the Hayne/Harvie study\n&gt; book it seems to be called horiage (if I&#39;m\n&gt; understanding the description correction) and also\n&gt; another term which I can&#39;t find right now. \n&gt; \n&gt; Is there a common name for this type of sunken\n&gt; relief carving? \n&gt; \n&gt; Ron\n&gt; STL\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been\n&gt; removed]\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n"
