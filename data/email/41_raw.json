For anyone that doesn&#39;t\nknow me - perhaps many of you since I&#39;m usually pretty quiet on all the\nlists I&#39;ve been on since Robert Cole&#39;s first - I am a notorious\nbibliomaniac, among other obsessions, mostly tsuba these days.\n\nUnfortunately I don&#39;t know any special terminology for these\nboxes-within-boxes except &quot;slipcover&quot; and &quot;shipping box.&quot; When I do get\nbooks that have the shipping box part (still on used or on new books) I\narchive them in the attic since they tend to look shoddy on my shelves. It&#39;s\na very Asian thing, although I have seen them on high-end European art\nbooks. Is Alan Bale on board here yet? He&#39;s the real pro on books.\n\nFor anyone who hasn&#39;t drifted off to sleep through this, what originally\ncame to my mind was &quot;chitsu,&quot; which is the name of the very Japanese folding\nbook cover with little ivory (or plastic) tabs that slip into little pockets\non the spine. Love those.\n\nOf course I can&#39;t spot my copy of &quot;Studies in Kyo Goto&quot; at the moment, wish\nthey had put the English on the spine, too. But I did find my copy of &quot;Tsuba\nno Bi&quot; that was discussed on the other list recently. In fact, I&#39;m pretty\nsure I have *two* copies of that.\n\nBibliomania - a perplexing and tragic affliction.\n\nCraig Harris\n\nPS - Thanks Jim for giving us a sane refuge.\n\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &quot;Jim Gilbert&quot; &lt;jggilbert@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Wednesday, April 23, 2003 7:22 PM\nSubject: Re: [nihontostudy] Bob R - Studies in Kyo Goto\n\n\n&gt; Bob,\n&gt; No ISBN number, but the name appears in English and Japanese on the front\n&gt; cover of the book, but not on the spine.  It doesn&#39;t appear in English on\n&gt; the thin board dust cover, but the name is in English on both the spine\nand\n&gt; the front of the thicker two-piece outer cardboard box.  (I don&#39;t know the\n&gt; proper terms for these boxes, I&#39;m sure Craig would know.)  It shouldn&#39;t be\n&gt; hard to spot.  I&#39;d guess that you could get it at Isshindo:\n&gt; http://www.book-kanda.or.jp/kosyo/1013/index.asp\n&gt;\n&gt; Jim\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Just to let everyone know that doesn&#39;t already. As Ron\n&gt; &gt; pointed out I do find books (and anything else LEGAL)\n&gt; &gt; over here in Japan for folks that ask. Sometimes I can\n&gt; &gt; find them very easily other times it takes me some\n&gt; &gt; time to locate them throughout Japan and have them\n&gt; &gt; shipped to me to send out. It has been a while since I\n&gt; &gt; updated my site and for that I appologize. But to find\n&gt; &gt; items or books any information you can get me such as\n&gt; &gt; ISBN Number is extremely helpful so is a picture of\n&gt; &gt; the cover as I am SLOWLY learning to read Japanese.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Bob R\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; =====\n&gt; &gt; Check out &quot;Cowboy&quot; Bob&#39;s Books & Things at:\n&gt; &gt; http://asia.geocities.com/gentleman9/index.html\n&gt; &gt;\n\n\n"
