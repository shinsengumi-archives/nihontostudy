One characteristic of Hirata Hikozo&#39;s fukurin is that they turn freely on the guard.  His are original to the plate and were put there for aesthetic reasons.  Most fukurin do not turn freely like that.  Sometimes fukurin were added when the mimi was damaged and/or the plate was reduced in diameter.  I suppose that&#39;s also for aesthetics.  \n\nThe only functional reasons for a fukurin that I can think of would be to keep a rough rim from catching on clothing or to protect the tsuba from wear (if you were really fussy about preserving your tsuba).  Of course for multi-layer construction a fukurin is sometimes used to mechanically hold the plates together and to cover what would otherwise be a pretty unattractive rim.  \n\nSometimes you find plates that have had a fukurin removed, but you can still see a ring left on the surface where it was applied.  One method of attaching a fukurin involved cutting a small rectangular notch in the mimi (usually at the &quot;6 o&#39;clock&quot; position), and sometimes you&#39;ll see this on a piece that has lost the rim cover.\n\nJim\n\n\n\n  Greetings all. Today I was watching an NBTHK novice course video and it has in the tsuba section, an interesting piece that had as its mimi, a ring that is perhaps 3 or 4 mm wide and it could be rotated. to try and explain this better, the, mimi would be like a tyre on a car wheel, the wheel doesn&#39;t turn but the tyre does, does this make sense ?????, maybe I should draw a picture LOL. \n\n  What would be the purpose of this if any ?. purely aesthetics ?, or would it have some hidden function ?\n\n  Cheers\n\n  Rich\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
