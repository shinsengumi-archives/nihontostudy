I came across this last\nweek on a website and it is now listed on yahoojapan\nauction.  \nhttp://page7.auctions.yahoo.co.jp/jp/auction/g11105190\n\nJim G said he would have attributed the larger to Mito\nwhile the smaller to Mito Shoami.  (Here is the link\nfor my mantis folder in the other yahoo group list\nphoto area) to see the ones I am talking about\nhttp://photos.groups.yahoo.com/group/nihonto/vwp?.dir=/mantis&.src=gr&.dnm=tsuba+11+%26+1.jpg&.view=t&.done=http%3a//photos.groups.yahoo.com/group/nihonto/lst%3f%26.dir=/mantis%26.src=gr%26.view=t\n\nI emailed the seller of this new being auctioned and\nthis was his response: &quot;The 081 Tsuba was made in the\nlast of edo period, 19 century. And the school of\ntsuba is presumed Aizu Shoami made. There is\ncomparatively cheap  in comparison with the quality.&quot;\n\nPerhaps those items we are attributing to Mito Shoami\nare done by Aizu Shoami?  I know they did a lot of\nmass produced, but even with that I think I read that\nthey did have competant metal workers?  Any comments\non these Aizu?  Perhaps they were copying the Mito in\nthis particular case?\n\nThanks.\nKen\n\nP.S. This one being auctioned really is tying the ones\nI own together even more.  Dai-sho in the making!\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nFree Pop-Up Blocker - Get it now\nhttp://companion.yahoo.com/\n\n"
