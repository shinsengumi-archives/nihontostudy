Is it an authentic\n  anything? And what sort of weapon is this &quot;tsuba&quot; supposed to go on? I\n  can&#39;t see it as being functional due to the position of the hole for\n  the blade.\n\n  I hope this link works, it&#39;s the only pic in the album:\n \nhttp://photos.groups.yahoo.com/group/nihontostudy/lst?.dir=/Andres&.src=gr&.view=\n\n  If it doesn&#39;t, can you look at the photo albums in the Yahoogroups\npage\n  and open the Album called Andres? That will take you there, too.\n\n  Best Regards,\n\n  Andres\n\n        Yahoo!
