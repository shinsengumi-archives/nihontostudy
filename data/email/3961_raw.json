Is it possible that the\n&gt; tekotsu we see in \n&gt; the early guards is from their being made from\n&gt; scraps of steel left \n&gt; over from swordmaking or other purposes and the\n&gt; admixture of different \n&gt; pieces led to the inclussions of differing densities\n&gt; and furthermore \n&gt; that the relative unimportance of the guard to the\n&gt; sword made the bumps \n&gt; around the ede a moot issue?  It seems that later on\n&gt; when the \n&gt; craftsmanship went up the tekotsu went away.  Oh\n&gt; boy, I&#39;m going to get \n&gt; it from this one!\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?  Yahoo!
