Sorry - Papers are a good start, but...\n\nI had alluded to Jim&#39;s article about tsuba care - he recommends boiling \nwater, which works\npretty well.\n\nOn paint, I should have been more clear (that&#39;s what I get for typing \nlate at night) - often older\ntsubas were lacquered - remmnants of old paint on a tsuba should be \nhandled with the greatest\ncare/respect (on really old tsuba you&#39;ll see the paint form this \nfunky/cool amalgum with the surface\npatina) - you have to proceed carefully (or just leave well enough \nalone) when you have old\npaint like that - I had a tosho once I nicknamed &quot;rusty crusty&quot; because \nthere was a fairly thick\nuncared for patina on it - BUT there was also a fair amount of what \nappeared to be original\nlacquer, so I left it well enough alone - while the tsuba would probably \nhave looked a whole\nlot better/sold for more if I had just attacked it a little with the \nivory/rubbing, it didn&#39;t seem\nright since it would have nuked the lacquer as well...  The real answer \nis experience...  You need\nto go and look at and study (and take good pictures of if you&#39;re \nmotivated) a bunch of good tsuba...\n\nOn &quot;primped&quot; tsuba, an amazing number of tsuba in the US appear to have \ngotten the &quot;treatment&quot; -\nI&#39;ve pretty much stopped buying pieces from people in the US who I don&#39;t \nknow because of this -\nI&#39;ve been burned enough so I can usually recognize its been jacked with, \nbut I get tired of sending\npieces back - but you&#39;ll even get stuff from Japan occasionally that has \nbeen &quot;helped&quot;...  (comments\nabout how many people don&#39;t seem to understand white balance on digital \ncameras deleted).\n\nGotta run,\n\nrkg\n(Richard George)\n\n&gt;Hi Richard,\n&gt;\n&gt;Thank you for your excellent words of wisdom.  I think the \n&gt;message I&#39;m getting is:  just leave well enough alone!  So I \n&gt;believe I will...  :o).  \n&gt;One thing, though:  for rookies like me, how would you suggest \n&gt;being able to spot the oiled, waxed, or (gulp) painted tsuba that \n&gt;may deceive me?  I certainly hear what you&#39;re saying, and want \n&gt;to heed your words.  But how, exactly, can I know it when I see it?  \n&gt;I don&#39;t believe any of the pieces I&#39;ve acquired thus far have been \n&gt;tampered with this way, but I guess I can&#39;t really be sure (I have \n&gt;not attempted any soap and water cleaning of them.  They \n&gt;appear in great condition to my untrained eye, and so I haven&#39;t \n&gt;felt any need to clean...).  Most of my pieces have Hozon papers: \n&gt;would this be any indication at all that the tsuba in question are \n&gt;more likely to be &quot;deception-free&quot;?  Or is that entirely irrelevant?  \n&gt;Sorry for all the bothersome questions, but I really am eager to \n&gt;become informed!  Many thanks, Richard, for your time and \n&gt;attention...\n&gt;\n&gt;Steve\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;--- In nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com, Richard George &lt;\n&gt;rkg@t...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;steven,\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;first,\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;DON&quot;T MESS WITH THE RUST INSIDE THE SUKASHI \n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;CUTOUTS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Now that I&#39;ve said that...\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;I&#39;ve seen all sorts of tsuba abuse (&quot;brown&quot; wax, various \n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;attempts at \n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;repatination, people who have\n&gt;&gt;decided they can do a better job of patination than the original \n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;maker \n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;and strip top quality\n&gt;&gt;pieces down and start over, people who just wax them with \n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;some magic \n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;compound, oil them, etc.,.) - don&#39;t do it -\n&gt;&gt;basically, Jinsoo is absolutely correct - if the surface patina is \n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;good, \n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;just store &#39;em somewhere where they\n&gt;&gt;won&#39;t get condensed on and rub them periodically with your \n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;hands/a soft \n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;cloth.  If its got problems, see below...\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;the deadly enemy of iron tsuba is red rust - if your piece has \n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;this on \n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;it, its a problem.  somehow you have to\n&gt;&gt;get this off - some people use horn, but I&#39;ve found that ivory \n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;seems to \n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;be really good for use to scrape this off\n&gt;&gt;while not harming the the brown rust (I think Jim Gilbert has an \n&gt;&gt;excellent article on this in a couple of\n&gt;&gt;places on line...).  - often you have to work at it quite a bit - I \n&gt;&gt;sometimes alternate scraping sessions with\n&gt;&gt;washing the piece in warm water with a mild soap and a soft \n&gt;&gt;toothbrush...  And again, you only want to\n&gt;&gt;do this ONLY on the outside surfaces of the tsuba, not down in \n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;the sukashi.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;After you&#39;ve done that, the revealed old rust regions are often \n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;pretty \n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;gnarly, or if the piece is just plain &quot;rough&quot;,\n&gt;&gt;you can &quot;pocket polish&quot; the piece - just carry it around\n&gt;&gt;in your pocket for a few weeks (NOT where you carry your keys/\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;change) - \n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;this gives the piece a nice rubbed look that\n&gt;&gt;is hard to get by just marathon rubbing sessions with a cloth...\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;When you&#39;re buying tsuba, always be on the lookout for pieces \n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;that have \n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;been &quot;primped&quot; like this - you&#39;ll see\n&gt;&gt;people that hide a multitude of sins with various waxes, oils, \n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;PAINT (I \n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;got a couple like this - the guy color\n&gt;&gt;matched the patina and jammed the tsuba (!!) - looked real \n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;darned good, \n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;too - I was quite happy until I tried to clean\n&gt;&gt;up a rough spot I thought was oil, used some enamel thinner, \n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;and - \n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;surprise!...), etc.,.  I&#39;d like to think they\n&gt;&gt;just wanted the pieces to look better/didn&#39;t know any better and \n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;really \n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;weren&#39;t thinking fraudulent thoughts, but....\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Good Luck,\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;rkg\n&gt;&gt;(Richard George)\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Milt,\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Jinsoo Kim told me that the best way to care for the old iron \n&gt;&gt;&gt;sukashi pieces I have is to simply rub them now and then \n&gt;&gt;&gt;      \n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;with a soft \n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;silk cloth.  I have read the various prescriptions for cleaning, \n&gt;&gt;&gt;waxing, etc... and, as I&#39;ve mentioned, I am quite the novice \n&gt;&gt;&gt;      \n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;and so \n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;am in the dark as to what the current thinking on this is.  The \n&gt;&gt;&gt;tsuba I have are all in excellent condition, with only minimal \n&gt;&gt;&gt;      \n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;spots \n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;of light surface rust in some of the sukashi openings, and \n&gt;&gt;&gt;      \n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;none on \n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;the plate or rim.  Again, I appreciate your thoughts on this, \n&gt;&gt;&gt;      \n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;and am \n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;gradually coming to a view that if I&#39;m in doubt, do nothing!  \n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Thanks again,\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Steve\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Yahoo!
