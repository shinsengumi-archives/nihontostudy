The &quot;badge&quot; on the top\nof the handle fitting (kabutogane) is a mon - a family crest, and a very nicely\nmade one.  These may or may not be real (in the &quot;family&quot; sense) but I won&#39;t talk\nabout that now.  They are fairly often found and usually regarded as a &quot;good\nsign&quot; of a better class blade in the mounting.  Yours is one of the so-called\nGenji mon, I believe, a symbol from history - perhaps someone knows more about\nthem.  Hawley produced a sheet of all the symbols and I&#39;ve probably still got\nmine around somewhere (40 years of detrtitus hanging around my neck!!!)\n\nThe writing on the wooden part of the tsuka is I believe the signature of the\nman who made the handle.  Whilst unusual such signatures are sometimes found.\nTo me they indicate a custom-made tsuka by an artisan and not a regular &quot;factory\njob&quot;.  Your signature has all the appearances of being &quot;enhanced&quot; by someone\nwith a felt pen, which is a real pity.  Some of these signatures I have found\nare of excellent calligraphy.  I believe there were a few families of note who\nwere handle binders by profession and were involved in creating better class\ngunto koshirae.  Your tsuka is one of the best-looking and best condition tsuka\nI have ever seen.  Like new - the silk still has a sheen. You are fortunate, so\nhelp to preserve it by only handling the tsuka with cotton gloves to avoid\nsoiling the silk.\n\nThe scratchy signatures on the metal parts are probably those of the owner and I\nnever pay them any attention as without other documentation it is near\nimpossible to find who the owner was..\n\nThe wooden blade indicates either (a) that a former owner polished the blade and\nput it into shirasaya and had a tsunagi (wooden blade) made for the koshirae.  I\nhave done this for a Tadahiro II katana I had polished.  Or (b) that a previous\nowner made his own tsunagi and simply sold off the blade...\n\nBest regards,\n\nBarry Thomas\n(Melbourne, Australia)\n\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &quot;Patrik Danielsson&quot; &lt;patrik.danielsson@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Saturday, January 28, 2006 11:25 PM\nSubject: [nihontostudy] Q:About Gunto mounting whith &quot;signs&quot; on all of the\nparts.\n\n\nHello\n\n(Not a &quot;real&quot; nihonto quest , but i try anyway.)\n\nI bought this pieces from a guy that bought this at EBAY for a couple of years\nago, he paid alot for it, he didnt notice that it had a &quot;wooden&quot; blade in\nit......he thought that it was a complete sword....but anyway i bought it from\nhim for a couple of $ now.\n\nMy question is, what are the &quot;marking&quot; on the top of the Tsuka?? and all of the\nparts has the same &quot;sign&quot; on them, can someone translate them?, and WHY are they\nsign??? On my other Gunto mountings there is no signs on any of the kosihrae\nparts.\n\n(i tried to fill in the signs on one of the photos)\n\nhttp://photobucket.com/albums/b196/swedeman/mounting/\n\n\n\nBest Regards\n\nPatrik\n\n"
