It should answer most\nof your question. According to Gary Murtha&#39;s Sword\nFittings book pg 44, it is probably a tsuba by Kyoto\nKiyonori or one of his students.\n\nI&#39;ve seen this tsuba a few times over the years. If\nyou (carefully) remove the pin holding on the tsuka\nand look at the face of the tsuba that was under the\ntsuka, you will (maybe 50/50 %) see a gold &#39;KAO&#39; mark\nlike that on the tsuba images uploaded to your folder.\nThe Kao will probably allow us to attribute it to a\nspecific person, althought the KAO shown by Murtha and\nthat recorded by Haynes are somewhat different for\nthese guys. Still, we should have a good idea.\n\nAccording to Murtha, Kiyonori was &quot;A Kyoto artist.\nSigned with gold inlaid kao. His favorite design being\ncrickets in grass. One of his students was Atsuiye who\nchanged his name to Noriiye.&quot;\n\nThey are nice tsubas. One of the fellow listmembers\nhad one a few years back. If he sold it, he could\nprobably tell you the value best.\n   I did not look closely, but do the fuchi-kashira\nmatch the tsuba in design? That would be nice.\n\nCurran\n\n\n\n--- Becky &lt;SNDE92BW@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; Ok, I posted my picture.  Apologies to Ron ? My\n&gt; first attempts went \n&gt; into his album, but now I have created one of my own\n&gt; - Becky&#39;s \n&gt; Sword.  There you can get to the picture and in the\n&gt; larger view you \n&gt; can get a pretty good look at the tsuba.  I haven&#39;t\n&gt; ever taken the \n&gt; handle off, so don&#39;t have a picture of just the\n&gt; tsuba.\n&gt; \n&gt; Becky\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com, Curran Campbell\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;neobliviscar@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Becky,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The image was stripped off the email by YAHOO!\n&gt; &gt; Try uploading it to a 3rd party site, or posting\n&gt; it to\n&gt; &gt; a photo folder within the Nihontostudy yahoogroup.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Curran\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- BECKY WALLACE &lt;SNDE92BW@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Note: forwarded message attached.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been\n&gt; &gt; &gt; removed]\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; __________________________________________________\n&gt; &gt; Do You Yahoo!?\n&gt; &gt; Tired of spam?
