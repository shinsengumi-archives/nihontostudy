There are references to some of the top kinko working with an eminent contemporary painter to develop their designs.  I don&#39;t know if there is hard proof for these claims, but they are frequently made.  It seems plausible, since a good draughtsman and metalworker isn&#39;t necessarily an inventive designer.\n\nI&#39;m not aware of any specific mention of customer-designed themes, but it&#39;d be hard to imagine that it didn&#39;t happen.  There are stories about some of the famous early chado (tea) masters having ceramic work made to their specifications by others.  Come to think of it, I suppose that the Yagyu tsuba are probably a good example of customer design that was fabricated by a number of different makers both known and unknown.  I haven&#39;t seen an original Yagyu design book, but I have a photocopy of a later hand-drawn copy of one.\n\nI have seen some original design books for shiiremono tsuba.  They are full of generic sorts of Nara-esq designs.  Someone had broken one of these up and was selling individual pages at one of the sword shows years ago.  They seem to be about the equivalent of tattoo parlor &quot;flash.&quot;\n\nThere are at least several fittings books that show illustrations taken from surviving design books from known makers.  One that happens to come to mind is Futagoyama Norisuke Ko, where about half of the book is illustrations of detailed sketches and oshigata by the Norisuke.  Some are original designs but quite a few are classic Yagyu, Yamakichibei, etc., that were presumably used as guides for their forgery work.  \n\nI suspect that most if not all makers would have had documents like these.  Basically sketch books for working out designs and oshigata to record finished works or works by others.  Probably well more than half of the fittings makers that ever worked made their living by simply turning out copies of standard designs that they did not create.  The number of real innovators isn&#39;t large, but these are of course the big names.\n\nMany fittings motifs are elaborations of things that have been in the culture for many years and it would be hard to credit a given designer.  Even some of the famous innovators&#39; work was in coming up with a novel twist on an old theme.  Most of them then proceeded to repeat themselves for the remainder of their careers, and their followers mostly did the same.\n\nThe first Yasuchika is one maker who really stands out for me in not doing this.  Going through a book of his work, it&#39;s remarkable how many times he would develop something really good and then leave it to go on to something different and also great.  His fabrication skill in both iron and copper alloy is incredible and he was either a great designer or knew the right people to work with (or steal from).\n\nJim  \n\n\n\n\n  Guys I am wondering who actually designed decorative themes that we see\n  so often on tsuba? Was this done by the actual tsuba-maker, or by a\n  contracted artisan or by the client or someone else? \n\n  And were these designs published in books somewhere along the line so\n  that later generations could copy these designs? If this is the case do\n  any of these books survive to this day? Are there any reprints?\n\n  - Matt\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
