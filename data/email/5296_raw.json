It is often applied to work that is in Goto style but is not Goto main or sideline work. Edo-kinko used to be used similarly for work in the style of Edo region machibori kinko schools, but lately this is generally lumped as &quot;Kyo-kinko&quot; as well. So it truly is a grab bag, but the problem (especially with menuki) is that there is so much Edo period kinko work with no unique character to it that makes it possible to give a more specific attribution.\n\n  BTW, generic Edo period kinko work of lower quality than Kyo-kinko is attributed to Kyo-kanagushi.\n\n  Jim\n\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: ROBSON Gordon \n  To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Wednesday, February 27, 2008 4:23 PM\n  Subject: Re: [nihontostudy] Kyo-kinko\n\n  Hi Ron,\n\n  My understanding is that Kyo-Kinko is the new name for Waki-Goto. This would \n  make them a grab bag like Ko-Kinko or even Shoami. Their dates are post-Ko-\n  Kinko, so early Edo to Bakumatsu. There is a Kyo-Kinko book out there. I think the \n  title is Kyo-Kinko no Kenkyu (research into Kyo-Kinko) or something like that. Jim \n  is probably better up on this stuff then I am.\n\n  On on different note, good luck to Harry.
