Where do you buy your Tsuba from? \n&gt;I know there&#39;s several websites you can find with a Google search, an \n&gt;occasional Token Kai show like the one in SF, or Ebay (most look like \n&gt;junk). I&#39;m looking for good sources of authentic Tsuba. Obviously the \n&gt;only way to be really sure of authenticity is to purchase papered \n&gt;Tsuba, but because I&#39;m starting off I want some sources of authentic \n&gt;Tsuba more reasonably priced. Any suggestions?\n&gt;\n&gt;Thanks for your helpo in advance,\n&gt;Anthony\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;Yahoo!
