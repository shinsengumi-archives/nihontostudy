It is with the \nprankster  and he promised not to dip the sword in acid to enhance \nthe hamon nor wack  the &quot; bushies &quot; ( ops, sorry about that ).\nThe prank was meant as a &quot; lesson &quot; to me for  &quot; thinking &quot; that  \nthere&#39;s a possibility  a hard working cleaning person could \nliberated  it from my hotel room ( a resonable possibility as I can&#39;t \nrecall exactly when/where the sword  was missed , if I can, then it \nwon&#39;t  go missing, yes ? ). The reason it went missing was I left it \nin the shinsa room. Absent-mindedness, it comes with advancing age.\nSo,  My appology to all the lists for causing all the fuss.\n\nOne thing I learned from this  &quot; prank &quot;......................\n The  show organisers are quick with members&#39;  concern, when I \nreported  the e-bay listing  very early in the morning ( through e-\nmail ), I got an immediate response. They contacted the hotel \nsecurity immediately and initiated an investigation which I have to \nlater explain that it could be a possible prank.   Not funny.\n\nLastly ,thank you all for the concerns, suggestions.  I am glad the \nsword is not with some wackos who may actually use it to wack the \nbushies  ( ops, sorry about that, again ).\n\nMilt\n\n\n\n\n"
