I have recently acquired a\nsword that seems worthy=\r\n and interesting enough to warrant a Japanese\npolish, a saya/habaki and sub=\r\nmission for papers.  Despite I have seen\nthe details of this process a few =\r\ntimes on this list, I don&#39;t remember\neverything, and I certainly don&#39;t know=\r\n the chronology of events and\ntheir respective costs (approximate) and the =\r\namount of time involved.\n&gt; \n&gt; Could someone tell me (again) the steps invol=\r\nved in sending a sword\nto Japan, having it polished, having a new habaki an=\r\nd shirasaya made\nand submitting it for papers?  I am particularly sketchy a=\r\nnd forgetful\nwith regard to the use of agents, how to navigate the blade th=\r\nrough\ncustoms, making sure it gets to who it needs to get to, etc.  Also, I=\r\n\nhaven&#39;t a clue as to how much this will all cost, nor how long it\ntakes.  =\r\nAny help is appreciated.  Thank you.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best Regards,\n&gt; Gary Gabelhouse\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"
