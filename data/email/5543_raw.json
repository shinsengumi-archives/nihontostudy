One is a copy of his book signed=\r\n with a inscription \nwhen he gave it to Dr Compton - very cool, but not muc=\r\nh information content, just a \nreference to happy sword collecting.   The o=\r\nther is a letter from Robinson (who had amazing \npenmanship) to the owner o=\r\nf a sword that I now own describing at length who made the \nsword, where it=\r\n was made etc.   Let me know if this would be of any interest.   Cheers, Bo=\r\nb.  -\n-- In nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com, &quot;excelsiorilluminati&quot; &lt;excelsiori=\r\nlluminati@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; A fellow I know and his kantei group have come up=\r\non some correspondence \n&gt; between Messrs.
