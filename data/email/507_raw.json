It&#39;s a copy of an Edo period manuscript.=\r\n  Joly&#39;s version of the same MS is called Toban Shinpin Zukan.  I don&#39;t hav=\r\ne &quot;TSZ,&quot; but I have made a limited comparison of my copy of your book with =\r\nthe version of TSZ that Haynes and Harvie are reprinting in the Northern Ca=\r\nlifornia club newsletter.  The numbering is different, but so far I&#39;ve foun=\r\nd the same guards in each and the text section appears to be the same.  The=\r\n drawings however are not identical even though they illustrate the same gu=\r\nards, so they appear to be based on different hand copies of an older MS.\n\n=\r\nI think that one of the comments in the Haynes/Harvie reprint in To Ron men=\r\ntioned that a certain guard was a classic Higo design, even though the sepp=\r\na dai was narrow like Kyo rather than the usual Higo shape.  The same tsuba=\r\n in my book had a normal, typical wider Higo seppa dai.  A different brush =\r\nhand at work.\n\nIt wasn&#39;t unusual for there to be multiple hand copied manus=\r\ncripts made from an original, and no doubt copies were made of the copies. =\r\n Maybe someone has more specific details on history behind these two books.=\r\n\nJim\n\n\n\n  All, I am having problems posting it seems, me thinks there is a =\r\nbug\n  inthe works. anyway, I&#39;ll post directly on the board.\n\n  I have picke=\r\nd up this tsuba book today and am curious about it. it\n  looks suspiciously=\r\n like the T=F4ban Shinpin Zukan but I don&#39;t believe it\n  is. hard bound, 21=\r\n0 pages, printed copies of original artwork, quite a\n  nice book.\n\n  Anyone=\r\n know what it may be ???  \n\n  http://tinyurl.com/g7b2\n\n  cheers\n\n  Rich \n\n\n=\r\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
