In the intro to the missing kokuho section list in the YNL,\nYamanaka mentions contributing to a magazine article on the subject by Alan\nSchwartz.  He doesn&#39;t mention the name of the magazine the article was\npublished in... for reasons that are now obvious assuming that this is the\nsame article.  The date would be a rough match.\n\nJim\n\n\n\nJim and All,\nI got the magazine out last night and think it is interesting enough in the\nhistory of sword collecting to recall to other. The article appears in the\nSAGA, 1965, I think the August issue. The &#39;article&#39; is really very short\nand full of total hooey. Yamanaka is mentioned as the authority but not the\nauthor. There are about a dozen nicely mounted swords shown\nnon-technically. These are noted as from the Ussui collection, but not\ndescribed at all. Then there is the list of 14 lost treasures. Each of\nthese gets a couple of paragraphs that list maker, date of recognition, and\ndate/place of surrender and in most cases the name of the American soldier\nwho received it. The source of this information is not explained.\nMy recollection is that the list that Albert presented in the Newsletter\nwas longer, but much less detailed in that it did not contain all the other\nbackground information. I have never seen this list presented anywhere\nelse.\nPeter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
