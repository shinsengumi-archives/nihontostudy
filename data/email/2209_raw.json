Thanks.  All this information you and the others \nare providing is very useful.  As it happens, none of the tsuba I \nhave is in &quot;dirty&quot; condition, so there is really nothing to tempt me \nto try cleaning in any form, except, perhaps, the occasional light \nrubbing with the soft cloth.  I hear what you&#39;re saying even here, \nhowever, so I will err on the side of caution, as you say.  Thanks, \ntoo, for your insight re: the Hozon papers question.  I appreciate \nit!\n\nSteve\n\n\n--- In nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com, &quot;frkirk&quot; &lt;frkirk@y...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; Hi Steven and All\n&gt; I am fairly new to the group but throught I would throw my 2 \ncents \n&gt; in.\n&gt; On the latter part of your question- if a tsuba has Hozon (or \nother \n&gt; respected) papers I woud leave it be- even be cautious about \nhow \n&gt; much you &quot;pocket polish&quot; it.  I have also heard tell of great \ntsubas \n&gt; that were made too glossy my over zealous cloth rubbers.  As \nyou \n&gt; say, leave well enough alone and err on the side of caution.\n&gt; If the tsuba is un-certified and you are unsure as to the \n&gt; authenticity of its patina, I beleive that dunking it in boiling \n&gt; water cannot harm it and may remove grime and wax at least.  \nPlease \n&gt; use only plain water for this and make sure the piece is dry \nASAP \n&gt; once it is removed.  What you may get from this process will be \na \n&gt; UGLY lookin tsuba since any false patina will be stripped and \nred \n&gt; rust, pits, etc will be exposed.  While you might be saying to \n&gt; yourself, &quot;It looked better before&quot; you now can start from \nground \n&gt; zero and nurse it back to health.\n&gt; \n&gt; Hope this helps\n&gt; Kirk\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com, &quot;steven&quot; &lt;\nsteven_88_2000@y...&gt; \n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Hi Richard,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Thank you for your excellent words of wisdom.  I think the \n&gt; &gt; message I&#39;m getting is:  just leave well enough alone!  So I \n&gt; &gt; believe I will...  :o).  \n&gt; &gt; One thing, though:  for rookies like me, how would you \nsuggest \n&gt; &gt; being able to spot the oiled, waxed, or (gulp) painted tsuba \nthat \n&gt; &gt; may deceive me?  I certainly hear what you&#39;re saying, and \nwant \n&gt; &gt; to heed your words.  But how, exactly, can I know it when I \nsee \n&gt; it?  \n&gt; &gt; I don&#39;t believe any of the pieces I&#39;ve acquired thus far have \nbeen \n&gt; &gt; tampered with this way, but I guess I can&#39;t really be sure (I \nhave \n&gt; &gt; not attempted any soap and water cleaning of them.  They \n&gt; &gt; appear in great condition to my untrained eye, and so I \nhaven&#39;t \n&gt; &gt; felt any need to clean...).  Most of my pieces have Hozon \npapers: \n&gt; &gt; would this be any indication at all that the tsuba in question \nare \n&gt; &gt; more likely to be &quot;deception-free&quot;?  Or is that entirely \n&gt; irrelevant?  \n&gt; &gt; Sorry for all the bothersome questions, but I really am eager \nto \n&gt; &gt; become informed!  Many thanks, Richard, for your time and \n&gt; &gt; attention...\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Steve\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com, Richard George &lt;\n&gt; &gt; rkg@t...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; steven,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; first,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; DON&quot;T MESS WITH THE RUST INSIDE THE SUKASHI \n&gt; &gt; CUTOUTS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Now that I&#39;ve said that...\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;ve seen all sorts of tsuba abuse (&quot;brown&quot; wax, various \n&gt; &gt; attempts at \n&gt; &gt; &gt; repatination, people who have\n&gt; &gt; &gt; decided they can do a better job of patination than the \noriginal \n&gt; &gt; maker \n&gt; &gt; &gt; and strip top quality\n&gt; &gt; &gt; pieces down and start over, people who just wax them with \n&gt; &gt; some magic \n&gt; &gt; &gt; compound, oil them, etc.,.) - don&#39;t do it -\n&gt; &gt; &gt; basically, Jinsoo is absolutely correct - if the surface patina \n&gt; is \n&gt; &gt; good, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; just store &#39;em somewhere where they\n&gt; &gt; &gt; won&#39;t get condensed on and rub them periodically with your \n&gt; &gt; hands/a soft \n&gt; &gt; &gt; cloth.  If its got problems, see below...\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the deadly enemy of iron tsuba is red rust - if your piece \nhas \n&gt; &gt; this on \n&gt; &gt; &gt; it, its a problem.  somehow you have to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; get this off - some people use horn, but I&#39;ve found that ivory \n&gt; &gt; seems to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; be really good for use to scrape this off\n&gt; &gt; &gt; while not harming the the brown rust (I think Jim Gilbert \nhas an \n&gt; &gt; &gt; excellent article on this in a couple of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; places on line...).  - often you have to work at it quite a bit -\n&gt;  I \n&gt; &gt; &gt; sometimes alternate scraping sessions with\n&gt; &gt; &gt; washing the piece in warm water with a mild soap and a \nsoft \n&gt; &gt; &gt; toothbrush...  And again, you only want to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; do this ONLY on the outside surfaces of the tsuba, not \ndown in \n&gt; &gt; the sukashi.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; After you&#39;ve done that, the revealed old rust regions are \noften \n&gt; &gt; pretty \n&gt; &gt; &gt; gnarly, or if the piece is just plain &quot;rough&quot;,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; you can &quot;pocket polish&quot; the piece - just carry it around\n&gt; &gt; &gt; in your pocket for a few weeks (NOT where you carry your \nkeys/\n&gt; &gt; change) - \n&gt; &gt; &gt; this gives the piece a nice rubbed look that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; is hard to get by just marathon rubbing sessions with a \ncloth...\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; When you&#39;re buying tsuba, always be on the lookout for \npieces \n&gt; &gt; that have \n&gt; &gt; &gt; been &quot;primped&quot; like this - you&#39;ll see\n&gt; &gt; &gt; people that hide a multitude of sins with various waxes, \noils, \n&gt; &gt; PAINT (I \n&gt; &gt; &gt; got a couple like this - the guy color\n&gt; &gt; &gt; matched the patina and jammed the tsuba (!!) - looked real \n&gt; &gt; darned good, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; too - I was quite happy until I tried to clean\n&gt; &gt; &gt; up a rough spot I thought was oil, used some enamel \nthinner, \n&gt; &gt; and - \n&gt; &gt; &gt; surprise!...), etc.,.  I&#39;d like to think they\n&gt; &gt; &gt; just wanted the pieces to look better/didn&#39;t know any better \nand \n&gt; &gt; really \n&gt; &gt; &gt; weren&#39;t thinking fraudulent thoughts, but....\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Good Luck,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; rkg\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (Richard George)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Milt,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Jinsoo Kim told me that the best way to care for the old \niron \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;sukashi pieces I have is to simply rub them now and then \n&gt; &gt; with a soft \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;silk cloth.  I have read the various prescriptions for \n&gt; cleaning, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;waxing, etc... and, as I&#39;ve mentioned, I am quite the novice \n&gt; &gt; and so \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;am in the dark as to what the current thinking on this is.  \nThe \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;tsuba I have are all in excellent condition, with only \nminimal \n&gt; &gt; spots \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;of light surface rust in some of the sukashi openings, and \n&gt; &gt; none on \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;the plate or rim.  Again, I appreciate your thoughts on this, \n&gt; &gt; and am \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;gradually coming to a view that if I&#39;m in doubt, do nothing!  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Thanks again,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Steve\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Yahoo!
