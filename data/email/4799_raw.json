Goodness \nan &#39;ichimonji&#39;, no =\r\nway. Then the little stroke that makes it look \nlike &#39;a y&#39; as I read in you=\r\nr letter afterwards grounded me. I can&#39;t \nID that mark. Interesting.

They are the \nlast 5 pic=\r\ntures in the folder.  If the sword blade is signed it \nappears to be with a=\r\n single character that looks something like a Y.  \nIt isn&#39;t very clear and =\r\nthe pictures aren&#39;t very good, but if anyone \ncan tell anything, I&#39;d sure l=\r\nike to know it.\n&gt;    \n&gt;   Thanks,\n&gt;    \n&gt;   Becky\n&gt; \n&gt; bungotakadasword &lt;Mu=\r\nramasaIII@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;           --- In nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com, BECK=\r\nY WALLACE \n&lt;SNDE92BW@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Wow, I can&#39;t believe it. The scan you=\r\n put in my folder. The one \n&gt; top left is identical to mine. Same crickets.=\r\n And the signature is \n&gt; identical to the one someone posted as a mino.
