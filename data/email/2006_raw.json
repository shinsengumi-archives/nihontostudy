My thinking Mito was based on the &quot;baroque&quot; handling of the rim and the carving style of the dragon.  I did assume that the plate was iron, although now that you mention it I can pick out copper-colored highlights where the patina is thin.  The copper plate doesn&#39;t change my attribution, but as I said, no doubt there were other groups who could produce the same.\n\nBTW Rich, there was a lot of Mito work in Nara/Hamano style.  The best makers had very good technique and if anything their versions are a bit over the top compared to the originals.  The carving style of the dragon would be rather unusual for Shoami.  The scales are done like Goto dragons, but it&#39;s a more flamboyant machi-bori style. \nJim\n\n\n\n  Jim et al,\n\n  http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?\n  ViewItem&item=2253732046&ssPageName=STRK:MEWN:IT\n\n  it was attributed to a possible Mito work.\n\n  I just received the  tanto.\n  The tsuba failed the magnet test.\n\n  With this new info, still Mito school ?\n\n  milt\n\n\n        Yahoo!
