He won&#39;t talk to me directly, only through an \n  arms dealer friend of his who has asked me to help out as he himself knows \n  nothing about Nihonto. I find this very unsatisfactory and have declined to \n  help out. However, I&#39;m writing an email to the bloke I know who is the \n  friend of the wealthy man outlining my reasons for not engaging, pointing \n  out the difficulties involved, and recommending his friend/customer do his \n  own internet research.\n\n  So, I&#39;m looking at your site to give a &quot;pointer&quot; example of a good sword to \n  buy with koshirae, and discovered this:\n\n  Ryumon Nobuyoshi\n  Kamakura Koto (ca. 1288), with koshirae\n  NBTHK Juyo Token, a particularly important piece.\n  $74,000 -consignment-\n\n  Trouble is, the link on the sword name Ryumon Nobuyoshi to more detail is:\n  http://www.nihonto.ca/taima/\n\n  which is of course the link to the Yamato Taima/Taema below. However, the \n  link on the blade itself is correct.\n  http://www.nihonto.ca/ryumon-nobuyoshi/\n\n  Best regards,\n  Barry Thomas.\n  . \n   \n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
