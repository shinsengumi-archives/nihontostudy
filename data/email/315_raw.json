They were mounted on a fitting on the handle rather than on the nakago.  So, large ovoid opening rather than a small wedge shaped one.  It seems that tsuba started to be mounted on the nakago in the early Heian period.\n\nBTW, there are a couple of surviving kenukigata tachi where the tsuba had to be mounted by sliding it on over the kissaki and down the blade.  The tsuba was retained in place with a small pin through the blade.  That method didn&#39;t seem to last too long.\n\nJim\n\n\n\n  Tom et all, there is a pic of a tsuba early on in Hakasui&#39;s Nippon-to ( \n  don&#39;t have the book in front of me ) that is an old rusted job found in \n  a tomb from memory,  it too has a large opening not unlike the one Jim \n  posted in his album. ( I hope the grey matter is working correctly )\n\n  Tom, that link didn&#39;t work for some reason, if others haven&#39;t seen this \n  tsuba  look into Jims pics, the filder is called nagamaki tsuba.\n\n  Rich\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
