The first thing one would\nwhat to do is to consult the book of Akiyama collected Nobuiye (title\nescapes me without reference material here) which illustrates the vast\nbulk of know Nobuiye out there. A few years ago a well known California\ndealer was lucky enough to find one at a show, bought it and it\neventually went Juyo. Sure enough is found among the Akiyama oshigata.\nYou can be quite sure that if such a tsuba left Japan and were correct\nthe price would have at least another zero on the end, and probably an\ninitial digit change as well.\n Arnold\n\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; matthewhoyle@... 01/30/05 5:32 PM &gt;&gt;&gt;\n\nGimei Nobuiye?\n\nhttp://www.nihonto.com/11.28.04.html\n\nMr. Weissberg evidently thinks it is gimei, my question is how can you\ntell?\nIt looks awfully similar to the ones in the books!\n\nAnd if it is indeed gimei, how old is it do we think?\n\nMatt\n\n\n\n\n \nYahoo!
