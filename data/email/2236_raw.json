Because the originality of the\ntsuba is compromised, there will usually be a significant point reduction\nfor later inlay to a good, older iron plate.  If the inlay is extensive it\nwill probably fail.   If it is an attempt to &quot;convert&quot; the tsuba to a\ndifferent type (even if mumei), or is very crude or done after the Edo\nperiod, it will fail.\n&gt;\n&gt; A hypothetical good Muromachi period Tosho guard with a subtle mon inlaid\nduring the Edo period would probably pass, but with a much lower point level\nthat the unaltered plate would have been awarded.  Also, if there is\nsignificant alteration to the piece, the date given will be that of the\nlatest work.\n&gt;\n&gt; Most of the late gomoku zogan, mukade, etc., will fail for poor quality.\nMaybe an exceptional example could pass, but I can&#39;t think of any examples.\nDoes anyone have one of these guards with an origami?\n&gt;\n&gt; My observations only, not endorsed by anyone.\n&gt; Jim\n&gt;\n&gt;   &gt; Jim,\n&gt;   &gt;  While making copies for the Chicago shinsa,I notice an iron tsuba\n&gt;   &gt; got the pinkie ........reason given was the inlays were added later.\n&gt;   &gt; Why is that ?  I mean if the soft metal inlays were added in the Edo\n&gt;   &gt; days, it was &quot; fashionable &quot; then and not meant to deceive .\n&gt;   &gt; I recall that tsuba was a mumei.\n&gt;   &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   Very interested in the reply here. Seems to me a lot of\n&gt;   very good tsuba had inlay which were later applications.\n&gt;   Ko-Nara, Heianjo, etc commonly used Saotome tsuba as\n&gt;   starting points. Also most of the gomoku zogan and mukade\n&gt;   styles, the inlay or wire is a later addition. I&#39;m sure\n&gt;   many other examples could be cited. Does that\n&gt;   mean none of those are eligible for papers?\n&gt;\n&gt;   Rich S\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
