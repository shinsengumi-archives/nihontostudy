I have seen many swords with Muromachi/Momo=\r\nyama style\n  &gt; koshirae over the years, but 99.9% have been 19th c. swords =\r\nin retro \n  &gt; style.\n  &gt; Two exceptions come to mind: Victor Harris and I c=\r\natalogued the blades in\n  &gt; the Museum of Japanese Sword Fittings in Tokyo =\r\nfor Christie&#39;s in &#39;05. In\n  &gt; that collection was a Momoyama tachi koshirae=\r\n that was later sold in \n  &gt; NY, the\n  &gt; other was an itomaki tachi made fo=\r\nr an Ikeda Daimyo in Christie&#39;s London.\n  &gt; Victor has seen this nagamaki a=\r\nnd agrees that it is 16th c.\n  &gt;\n  &gt; I think this weapon is the first of a =\r\nnumber of identical contract pieces\n  &gt; for an armoury, as it is numbered &#39;=\r\n1&#39; as are one seppa, the fuchi and the\n  &gt; tsuka in ink under the fuchi, it=\r\n is utilitarian, with thin yamagane \n  &gt; mounts\n  &gt; and low quality lacquer=\r\n, the nakago-ana are not well made. The long ububa\n  &gt; can be accounted for=\r\n by its lack of use, it may have been polished \n  &gt; only once\n  &gt; or twice =\r\nthen stored for a very long time, this would account for its \n  &gt; fairly\n  =\r\n&gt; good condition apart from the leather tsuka binding shrinking and being\n =\r\n &gt; attacked by insects.\n  &gt;\n  &gt; It may look like a sword but it has the thi=\r\nck saya of a polearm, no \n  &gt; kurikata\n  &gt; and the tsuka is 21.5&quot; long.\n  &gt;=\r\n\n  &gt; As I stated in my earlier post it weighs around 6lbs, this is not \n  &gt;=\r\n something\n  &gt; one would want as a personal weapon, it is too heavy and awk=\r\nward to carry\n  &gt; and I think would only be useful in battle.\n  &gt;\n  &gt; --\n  =\r\n&gt; I am using the free version of SPAMfighter.\n  &gt; We are a community of 7 m=\r\nillion users fighting spam.\n  &gt; SPAMfighter has removed 9 of my spam emails=\r\n to date.\n  &gt; Get the free SPAMfighter here: http://www.spamfighter.com/len=\r\n\n  &gt;\n  &gt; The Professional version does not have this message\n  &gt;\n  &gt; [Non-t=\r\next portions of this message have been removed]\n  &gt;\n  &gt; \n\n  [Non-text porti=\r\nons of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n  \n\n[Non-text portions of this me=\r\nssage have been removed]\n\n\n"
