A relative picked it up at a flea market, hoping to mount \nit on a =\r\ndrawer, but now it&#39;s mine :-).\n\nI&#39;ve looked through the above site, but I&#39;m=\r\n having trouble both dating \nit and determining the style. I know the leave=\r\ns and flower are \nchrysanthemum, but that&#39;s about it. It&#39;s 85 mm (3.35 in) =\r\nin diameter \nand weighs 96 gram (3.39 oz). I can&#39;t find any characters engr=\r\naved on \neither side or the rim. I&#39;m guessing it&#39;s made of iron with patche=\r\ns of \ngold leaf.\n\nThe link to the front is http://tinyurl.com/d9fvq and to =\r\nthe back is \nhttp://tinyurl.com/b6643 . My lack of photography skills is le=\r\ngendary, \n so please ignore the level differences and let me know if better=\r\n \npictures are required.\n\nI doubt there&#39;s much market in my area for this t=\r\nype of item and I&#39;m \ndefinitely keeping it for the novelty, but I&#39;d be curi=\r\nous to know if \nit&#39;s worth 50 cents or 5 dollars.\n\nThat&#39;s all for now, than=\r\nks in advance for any comments.\n\nPetter\n\n\n\n\n"
