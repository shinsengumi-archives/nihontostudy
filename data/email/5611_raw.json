Instead these replicas produce a flat &quot;clat&quot; like note.\n\n  I have for some time presumed that this was due to their asymmetry, \n  however, could this be due to these weapons lack of hardness\n\n  Therefore can you clarify if Japanese swords do &quot;sing&quot; if struck?\n\n  Any help would be most warmly received.\n\n  With much thanks\n\n  Dean\n\n\n\n  \n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
