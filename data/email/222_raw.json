I don&#39;t know if it was me or what, but I\nfound the first several paragraphs almost incomprehensible. I also noted the\nlack of mention of the Hawaii Taikai put on by the NTHK back in the early\n80s, which included a one month show at the Honolulu Academy of Arts, a one\nday display by craftsment and a lecture by Yoshikawa Kentaro sensei\n(brilliantly translated by me, I might add). I found myself agreeing to some\nof the points raised, but thinking there was a lot of over generalizing,\nparticularly in terms of disagreeing with &quot;sensei.&quot; It depends on the\nsensei. There is also something called politeness. Telling a man in his 80s\nthat he is full of it is probably not the best way to develop relationships.\nAs for Western scolarly works on Japanese swords, I think we can see this\nattitude everywhere, not just from the Japanese. What would you say to\nsomeone who told you that so and so was a famed Japanese professor of\nShakespeare? You are not only English, but an English professor yourself.\nYou have never heard of so-and-so. You also find out that so-and-so can&#39;t\nspeak English and has never published anything on Shakespeare in the English\nlanguage. I think you might have trouble accepting the statement that\nso-and-so is a famed professor of Shakespeare. Since most Western &quot;scolars&quot;\nof the Japanese sword do not publish in Japanese and may not even be able to\nread the language let alone speak it, I have little problem agreeing that\ntheir work might not be up to snuff. Bob, on the other hand, is recognized\nhere as being &quot;mekiki&quot; (good eyed) and &quot;erai&quot; (brilliant). Hagihara sensei\nwas blown away by his book. I have been writing a series in Japanese on the\nKanabo school, which has also been well recieved here. I don&#39;t want to be\nhard on Bob, but I thought there was some self-serving stuff in there, as\nwell as a bit of hypocricy, &quot;you&#39;re a bunch of dealers, but I ran an auction\nthat was educational.&quot; Hmmm.\n\nGordon\n  -----Original Message-----\n  From: Jim Gilbert [mailto:jggilbert@...]\n  Sent: Friday, May 09, 2003 12:39 PM\n  To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com\n  Subject: Re: [nihontostudy] Fw: Haynes article\n\n\n  Here it is...\n  http://tinyurl.com/bcac\n\n  Jim\n\n  [BTW, I should have typed Cooper, not Copper...]\n\n\n    The news letter has not made it over here yet, so I cannot comment on\nit.\n\n    G\n    ----------\n    From: &quot;Jim Gilbert&quot; &lt;jggilbert@...&gt;\n    To: &lt;nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n    Subject: Re: [nihontostudy] Fw: Haynes article\n    Date: Thu, 8 May 2003 13:16:14 -0400\n\n\n    Ron and all,\n    Well, I&#39;d certainly like to see more major US displays, lectures, etc.,\nbut\n    I don&#39;t think that the situation is quite so bleak.\n\n    There have been other significant museum shows (Copper Union, Japan\nSociety,\n    Phoenix Art Museum, etc.), lecturers from Japan, and many smaller\ndisplays\n    put on in NY, LA and SF that are not associated with sword shows.  And\nof\n    course the sword shows themselves have not-for-sale displays of swords\nand\n    fittings and the occasional lecture.\n\n    I found the comments about Japanese experts and foreign students in the\n    first half of the article more provocative.  Again, I have a more\npositive\n    outlook, but I&#39;d like to hear some comments from the guys with long term\n    experience in Japan.\n\n    Jim\n    -------------\n\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n        Yahoo!
