This pr=\r\noduces a glaze like finish.  It&#39;s most remembered in \nthe kanayama school p=\r\nieces but used in others.\n\n\n- In nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Barry Thoma=\r\ns&quot; &lt;warlord@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Alan and Blokes &#39;n&#39; Sheilas,\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Glazed surfa=\r\nce&quot;.  Now that&#39;s interesting.  How was the glaze \nproduced??  For\n&gt; such a =\r\nfeature to have lasted a few centuries it must be very hard, \nwhich\n&gt; sugge=\r\nsts to me that it was produced by heating the tsuba in a \nfurnace to induce=\r\n\n&gt; an oxidation on the surface that became &quot;the glaze&quot;.  If chemically \nind=\r\nuced it\n&gt; would show wear, surely.  Just some mild speculation over my \nbre=\r\nakfast oats...\n&gt; \n&gt; Barry Thomas.\n&gt; \n&gt; ----- Original Message -----\n&gt; From:=\r\n &quot;Alan Bale&quot; &lt;abale@...&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Sunda=\r\ny, March 19, 2006 7:12 AM\n&gt; Subject: Re: [nihontostudy] Re: tsuba kantei 3\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Ron,\n&gt; There is a Naokatsu tsuba currently on sale at Aoi Art: FO55=\r\n0 - \nMarch 17, I\n&gt; quite like these copies, I had one by Gassan Sadakazu wh=\r\nich \nattempted to copy\n&gt; Nobuie&#39;s glazed surface.\n&gt; Alan\n&gt; \n&gt;   ----- Origi=\r\nnal Message -----\n&gt;   From: Ron Hartmann\n&gt;   To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.c=\r\nom\n&gt;   Sent: Saturday, March 18, 2006 7:35 PM\n&gt;   Subject: Re: [nihontostud=\r\ny] Re: tsuba kantei 3\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   Jim -\n&gt; \n&gt;   Funny, but this work reminded =\r\nme somewhat of Jirotaro Naokatsu is \nstyle.\n&gt; Realizing he copied Nobuie an=\r\nd seeing the super quality of this \nwonderful tsuba,\n&gt; I go along with the =\r\nNobuie call for it.
