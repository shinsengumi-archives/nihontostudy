I might have to repost this query again. Forgot about Jim and Gordon both being in the UK this past week. Looking at the set again yesterday, I have gained a new appreciation of it and can see why it was purchased several years ago. It certainly looks Momoyama era work and fits the bill for early f/k style as described by Gordon during his exhibit talks. If that early I would think the mei would be kind of unique to find.  \n\nRon\nSTL\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: alchemyst \n  To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Wednesday, October 01, 2003 9:10 AM\n  Subject: [nihontostudy] Re: fuchi/kashira set mei\n\n\n  Ron -\n\n  Nicely carved mei, but nothing in the Kinko Meikan\n  close to it.\n\n  Rich S\n\n\n        Yahoo!
