T=\r\no \nfind a stiffer\n&gt;   deer one would have to go to the tundra...\n&gt; \n&gt;   I r=\r\necall well a tsuba that I found many years ago.  It was a \nsmall, copper\n&gt; =\r\n  sanmai awase (if I correctly remember a phrase I haven&#39;t uttered \nfor 15 =\r\nor more\n&gt;   years!) with a touch of silver (tin??) showing stylised \n(stamp=\r\ned?) waves with a\n&gt;   creature on it that I always thought was an &quot;over-end=\r\nowed \nrabbit&quot;, but Bob\n&gt;   Haynes told me was a fox!!  I wrote to Bob when =\r\nI saw a similar \ntsuba in one of\n&gt;   his catalogues.  I was amazed when he =\r\nsaid this was a very early \nstyle of tsuba\n&gt;   ca 1300 - 1400.  I had it fo=\r\nr years, often looking at it and \nsaying &quot;Do I like\n&gt;   it, or do I not??&quot; =\r\n Same thing with this deer kinko.  I have \ngazed at Pete\n&gt;   Klein&#39;s image =\r\non yahoo (I actually have the Lundren Collection \nbook, but it&#39;s\n&gt;   out on=\r\n loan to a &#39;kinko&#39; mate) for a long time on this sleepless \nnight, and I\n&gt; =\r\n  ask myself the same question all over again.  So David Z, if I \ncould ask=\r\n you a\n&gt;   question, when you say &quot;I don&#39;t collect kinko at all,  but this =\r\n\nis one of a\n&gt;   small number of cases which, granted a opportunity, would =\r\nlead me \nto alter my\n&gt;   policy&quot; I have to ask you &quot;WHY??&quot;  Please explain.=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt;   If I found this very tsuba I would think it was junk.  I don&#39;t \nhav=\r\ne to tell you\n&gt;   why.  Or do I??  The design spilling into the seppadai I =\r\nhave \nonly seen on tsuba\n&gt;   I didn&#39;t care for.  The wobbly surface and inc=\r\nredibly bad nanako \nwould kill it\n&gt;   for me.  And the stiff deer doesn&#39;t d=\r\no anything for me at all.  \nHowever, I would\n&gt;   look at the larger than us=\r\nual kozuka ana and opine &quot;Hmmm, maybe \nit&#39;s early&quot;.\n&gt;   Back to my question=\r\n to myself &quot;Do I like it, or do I not&quot;.  If I \ndon&#39;t like it,\n&gt;   I don&#39;t c=\r\nollect it, no matter what the aesthetes say.\n&gt; \n&gt;   Now, this puts me into =\r\nthe rustic class, I know, but there is a \npoint to this\n&gt;   that is not all=\r\n derisory or derogatory.  It is this.  It is easy \nto pick\n&gt;   excellent wo=\r\nrk amongst Edo period tsuba , even in the iron &quot;wabi-\nsabi&quot; class,\n&gt;   but =\r\nthe archaic styles, the transition between (if we might say) \nconceptual\n&gt; =\r\n  forerunners and the refined later schools is much, much more \ndifficult. =\r\n Or is\n&gt;   it??  Recall here Milt&#39;s hawk tsuba that lead to the present \ndi=\r\nscussion.  And I\n&gt;   can show you a tsuba that a well-educated (tsuba knowl=\r\nedge) mate \nof mine\n&gt;   dismissed as &quot;late, possibly 1920s&quot;.  It is a maste=\r\nrwork of late \nEdo/early Meiji\n&gt;   and belongs to a friend of mine.  If he =\r\ngives permission I&#39;ll put \nup some images\n&gt;   of it.\n&gt; \n&gt;   So, to bring th=\r\nis to a close, are there any others inhabiting the \nsame closet as\n&gt;   I???=\r\n  I know I&#39;m lacking an ability, an aesthetic if you like, to \nappreciate t=\r\nhe\n&gt;   stiff deer kinko in question and it worries me.  It seems without \nt=\r\nhorough study\n&gt;   and training many tsuba in this time frame would indeed b=\r\ne \nconsidered junk and\n&gt;   sold off, possibly to an ignominious fate.  The =\r\nother kinko that \nPete shows in\n&gt;   two images at the same link does &quot;speak=\r\n to me&quot;.  It is from the \nsame time frame\n&gt;   and I find it elegant and ref=\r\nined and would collect it.  I think \nthis discussion\n&gt;   parallels the Sue =\r\nKoto kazuuchimono line of thinking with blades -\n I don&#39;t\n&gt;   collect those=\r\n either...\n&gt; \n&gt;   Barry Thomas\n&gt;   (Melbourne, Australia)\n&gt; \n&gt;   ----- Orig=\r\ninal Message -----\n&gt;   From: &quot;klepet33319&quot; &lt;Ppeterdds@...&gt;\n&gt;   To: &lt;nihonto=\r\nstudy@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt;   Sent: Monday, April 17, 2006 5:50 AM\n&gt;   Subject=\r\n: [nihontostudy] Re: in defense of the ugly bird or \nseeking more &quot;\n&gt;   pun=\r\nishment &quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   Link to scan &#39;deer&#39; tsuba from Lundgren collection:\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt;   http://ph.groups.yahoo.com/group/nihontostudy/photos/view/7936?b=3D3\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt;   SPONSORED LINKS Buy fine art  Japanese translation  Japanese \nincen=\r\nse  \n&gt;         Fine art inkjet paper  Fine art printing  Fine art \nappraisa=\r\nl  \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ---------------------------------------------------------------=\r\n-----\n----------\n&gt;   YAHOO!
