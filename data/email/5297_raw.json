True black shakudo or solid gold would be unlikely to be in the hands of a poor craftsman.  Kyo-kanagushi type work is usually done in muddy copper alloys or occasionally gold plate.  The quality of the carving is not high, either.\n\nJim  \n\n\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: satcho.michael_harris \n  To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Wednesday, February 27, 2008 7:20 PM\n  Subject: [nihontostudy] Re: Kyo-kinko\n\n\n  Jim,\n\n  Is it then safe to say that Kyo-kanagushi is the catch-all and we \n  need look to the materials and workmanship to distinguish from Kyo-\n  kinko...or is it solely workmanship?\n\n  Michael\n\n  satcho.com\n  http://www.satcho.com Specialists in books related to the study & \n  appreciation of the Japanese sword as art. \n  _______________________________________________\n\n  --- In nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Jim Gilbert&quot; &lt;jggilbert@...&gt; \n  wrote:\n  &gt;\n  &gt; Kyo-kinko is non-Goto (non-Mino, etc.) kinko work from after the \n  Momoyama period. It is often applied to work that is in Goto style \n  but is not Goto main or sideline work. Edo-kinko used to be used \n  similarly for work in the style of Edo region machibori kinko \n  schools, but lately this is generally lumped as &quot;Kyo-kinko&quot; as well. \n  So it truly is a grab bag, but the problem (especially with menuki) \n  is that there is so much Edo period kinko work with no unique \n  character to it that makes it possible to give a more specific \n  attribution.\n  &gt; \n  &gt; BTW, generic Edo period kinko work of lower quality than Kyo-kinko \n  is attributed to Kyo-kanagushi.\n  &gt; \n  &gt; Jim\n  &gt; \n  &gt; \n  &gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n  &gt; From: ROBSON Gordon \n  &gt; To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n  &gt; Sent: Wednesday, February 27, 2008 4:23 PM\n  &gt; Subject: Re: [nihontostudy] Kyo-kinko\n  &gt; \n  &gt; \n  &gt; Hi Ron,\n  &gt; \n  &gt; My understanding is that Kyo-Kinko is the new name for Waki-Goto. \n  This would \n  &gt; make them a grab bag like Ko-Kinko or even Shoami. Their dates \n  are post-Ko-\n  &gt; Kinko, so early Edo to Bakumatsu. There is a Kyo-Kinko book out \n  there.
