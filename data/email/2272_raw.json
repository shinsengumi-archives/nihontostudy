I suppose that the whole plate might have been covered at some point.  \n\nIt&#39;s a strangely shaped ana and even stranger to see three of them together.  I wonder if they were mounted together on some non-weapon object for display at some point.  If done in the late 19th or early 20th C, there could be a fairly good patina on the walls.\n\nJim\n\n\n\n  please klick................\n\n  http://tinyurl.com/4l8z9\n\n  kindly look at pic 073f, near the rim at 9 to 11 o&#39;clock area. I see \n  traces of what looks like &quot; lacquer &quot;.\n  Is it possible in the edo days the whole flat surface was covered \n  with black lacquer ?\n\n  Also look at pic 072f.............\n  the &quot; strange shape hole &quot; appeared to be made same time as the other \n  holes ( kogai, kozuka ), I based this conclusion on the \n  rust/condition of the inside of the holes ( one reason NOT to clean \n  the holes ? ).  There is evidence that the tsuba were actually \n  used/mounted.\n\n  All three tsuba came from the same source/collection, can we assumed \n  they are meant for a single weapon ( e.g. a socket yari ) , like the \n  samurai changed them like he changed cloths ?\n\n  milt\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
