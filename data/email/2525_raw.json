I will try that tonight. Welcome \nback and ha=\r\nppy new year to you and the family.\n\nanother few for interest, the first on=\r\ne, I have been getting indications \nthis is Namban maybe, I have no idea ha=\r\nt the symbols are though Barry \nThomas says he has an almost identical tsub=\r\na catalogued in a book from \nthe early 1900&#39;s he is going to dig out for me=\r\n.\n\nNamban ?\nhttp://members.westnet.com.au/whiz/richard/tsuba/symbol-tsuba-f=\r\nront.jpg\nhttp://members.westnet.com.au/whiz/richard/tsuba/symbol-tsuba-back=\r\n.jpg\n\nAkasaka. I am hoping early more so than later. Construction layers ar=\r\ne \nvisible but I have not determined how many and will look closer on the \n=\r\nweekend\nhttp://members.westnet.com.au/whiz/richard/tsuba/akasaka-2-front.jp=\r\ng\nhttp://members.westnet.com.au/whiz/richard/tsuba/akasaka-2-back.jpg\n\nThis=\r\n one came as S=F4heishi S=F4ten Tadashige. I cannot make out the mei at \nal=\r\nl but can see the Tadashige clearly enough\nhttp://members.westnet.com.au/wh=\r\niz/richard/tsuba/tadashige-front.jpg\nhttp://members.westnet.com.au/whiz/ric=\r\nhard/tsuba/tadashige-back.jpg\n\nIchiryu Tomoyoshi. Dr. Robson tells me there=\r\n is an exact same tsuba in \nthe book Mito katana to Tosogu no Meihin and th=\r\ninks whilst the mei is a \nlittle different, it could be the shodai or one o=\r\nf the students. I am \nwaiting to here if anyone has a copy of this or in fa=\r\nct, how much this \nbook is.\nhttp://members.westnet.com.au/whiz/richard/tsub=\r\na/tomoyoshi.jpg\nhttp://members.westnet.com.au/whiz/richard/tsuba/tomoyoshi-=\r\nmei.jpg\n\nthanks for the band width.\n\nRich\n\n\n\nRichard Turner\nNihont=F4 Messa=\r\nge Board\n&lt;http://members5.boardhost.com/Nihon-To/&gt;\n- /for the discussion an=\r\nd sharing of all things Nihont=F4/\n\n \n\n\n\nJim Gilbert wrote:\n\n&gt; Rich,\n&gt; Piec=\r\nes like that seem to have been used to change the shape of the \n&gt; seppa dai=\r\n to accommodate a certain shape and/or size of saya and \n&gt; tsuka.  There ar=\r\ne tsuba where the seppa dai has been enlarged by \n&gt; fitting pieces all of t=\r\nhe way around.  Sometimes various pieces \n&gt; (including the more common hits=\r\nuana plugs) are inserted by a later \n&gt; collector to restore the look of the=\r\n guard to something like what he \n&gt; believes to be its original state.\n&gt;\n&gt; =\r\nI could imagine a piece like being inserted to repair damage if it \n&gt; were =\r\nsomewhere else on the guard.  It&#39;s hard to imagine how that \n&gt; particular s=\r\npot would be damaged. \n&gt;\n&gt; I have seen a fair number of tsuba that have a p=\r\nronounced asymmetry to \n&gt; the shape of the seppa dai in that location.  The=\r\nre is metal &quot;missing&quot; \n&gt; from the same position at the upper right.  My gue=\r\nss is that at some \n&gt; time and/or place a slightly asymmetrical tsuka or sa=\r\nya shape was in \n&gt; style and that tsuba were either made or modified to acc=\r\nommodate that \n&gt; shape.  I haven&#39;t come across such a koshirae and not bein=\r\ng a sword \n&gt; user I can&#39;t guess as to why such a shape might be desirable. =\r\n\n&gt;\n&gt; The insert on your guard might be an attempt to change one of these \n&gt;=\r\n tsuba to the more common symmetrical oval shape.\n&gt;\n&gt; Any other ideas?\n&gt;\n&gt; =\r\nJim\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
