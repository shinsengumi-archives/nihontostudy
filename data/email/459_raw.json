I think that these are hybred\noshigata as only width and curvature is given, but not a specific length for\nthe blade. Also note in regard to the Kanabo information, no Yamato-den\nstyle workmanship has been seen is false. I have a ko-wakizashi signed Nanto\nju Kanabo Hayatonosho Masazane on the omote and kore wo Hosho utsusu (this\nis a Hosho copy) on the ura. The nakago has a ichimon style nakagojiri with\nhigaki yasuri like Hosho works and the jigane is masame with a narrow suguha\ntemper and nijuba, all typical of the Hosho school of the Yamato-den.\nRemember, never say never.\n\nGordon\n  -----Original Message-----\n  From: Jim Gilbert [mailto:jggilbert@...]\n  Sent: Thursday, July 03, 2003 12:52 PM\n  To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com\n  Subject: Re: [nihontostudy] A different view...\n\n\n  Seems pretty clear that the oshigata in the link Tom posted are of\nspecific, individual swords given the exact dimensions and descriptive text\nassociated with each example.\n\n  Agreed that it would be very interesting to compare these new oshigata vs.\nthe traditional style of drawing vs. the actual swords.  A project for you\nsword guys...\n\n  Jim\n\n    Peter-\n          I&#39;ll be corrected if I am wrong, but I am almost certain that\n    what you are seeing on the website are specific oshigata of\n    individual swords. In the Dokuhon, the oshigata especially for the\n    general characteristics of individual schools, the images are\n    &quot;idealized&quot; like in Teiryo Yoji. Sometimes I have found those to be\n    &quot;not quite&quot; what I am seeing in a sword. Takes some imagination to\n    reconcile what the book shows and what you see in hand. It is still\n    the best book for kantei.\n          These oshigata are REAL swords and it really would be\n    enlightening to compare, sword, photo, oshigata and &quot;Diagrammatic\n    Oshigata&quot; side by side...\n    -t\n\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n        Yahoo!
