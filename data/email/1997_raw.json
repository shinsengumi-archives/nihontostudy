I have picked up several books (and yes, read them) and came\n&gt;to the realization that the only way to start expanding my\n&gt;understanding from this point is to start making some purchases. The\n&gt;question I pose to all here is this:\n&gt;Is there any one thing that a new collector should look for above all\n&gt;else when making a buy?\n&gt;Now, I know this is a very generalized question, but I need to start\n&gt;somewhere.\n&gt;\n&gt;Thanks all!\n&gt;\n&gt;Alex Bivin\n&gt;\n&gt;BTW - Would like to thank Mr. Stein for his excellent website! It was\n&gt;largely thanks to you that I understand what little I do!\n&gt;\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nOverwhelmed by debt?
