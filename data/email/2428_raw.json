I&#39;ve always refered to these as &quot;hot stamped&quot; but really, I wonder how the smith applied these stamps. The nakago being soft (not hardened), were they punched in after the sword was finished? It would seem illogical to think the smith &quot;heated the nakago&quot; enough to &quot;hot stamp&quot; their seal. Can anyone explain how this was done? \n\nA related question is about Masahide who did apply a &quot;kokuin&quot; to his nakago. Does anyone know if Masahide ever signed his nakago with his &quot;kokuin&quot; only? (Not signing his full mei with it.) \n\nRon\nSTL\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
