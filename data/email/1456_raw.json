The main\nthing I remember was that there was a lot of non-fittings related stuff that\nmade it a bit too far removed for any but a totally dedicated fittings\nperson. I almost expected you to have made the plunge. I rather doubt if\nthey sold very many of those. On a sort of related note, the big Masamune\nand his school book, which has a list price of over 100,000 yen is selling\nfor 40,000 and I got mine for 38,000. I wish I had known about the big book\nsell off at the museum, but I already bought most of what I wanted for full\nprice earlier on.\n\n \n\nGordon\n\n \n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Jim Gilbert [mailto:jggilbert@...] \nSent: Tuesday, January 13, 2004 10:31 AM\nTo: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: Re: [nihontostudy] tsuba designs?\n\n \n\nI don&#39;t remember Matt.  My impression is that it was a lot more than one\nwould normally expect 8 big, glossy, expensive Japanese fittings books to\nbe.  Thinking about it I can picture a fittings museum book shelf price card\nof Y960,000 or 690,000, but I wouldn&#39;t bet on it.  Maybe Alan or Craig knows\nwhat they go for these days.  The fittings museum was offering some\nsignificant discounts for cash book purchases toward the end.\n\nJim \n\n\n\n  How much was it ....... out of interest?\n\n  - Matt\n\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n  _____  \n\nYahoo!
