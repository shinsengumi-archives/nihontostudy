Soshu style -- not all that common; ubu; student \n[atribution, school of] of not only a good smith, but a student of \nMasamune -- considered the O-Kaji -- if i can make up a word -- the \nmaster of master smiths.  His work is almost never signed, and it is \nnot surpising his student&#39;s swords were not either.  He worked for \nthe Shogun of the Kamakera Bankafu thus would not usually sign his \nname as a relatively indendent smith might. It has good paper. In \ngood polish.  And since they do not say, I assume it is delivered in \nshirasaya.  Being a newcomer to Nihon-to myself, that is about all I \ngot.  I am sure the more Knowledgable members can expand upon, or \ncorrect, my comments.\n\nOne question for the group:  Why the three mekugie ana?  \n\nDoug\n\n\n"
