I will\n  certainly have a number of pieces that have genuine uttori overlays with me.\n  So, we can continue the Tampa discussion in SF. I have expanded my Ko-Mino\n  collection, so there will be a chance to compare Ko-Mino, Ko-Kinko and\n  Ko-Goto pieces as well. \n\n\n\n  Gordon\n\n\n\n  -----Original Message-----\n  From: Ron Hartmann [mailto:swords@...] \n  Sent: Tuesday, February 01, 2005 1:31 AM\n  To: TOKEN; nihontostudy; nihonto@yahoogroups.com\n  Subject: [nihontostudy] identifying utori technique\n\n\n\n  Another topic which we discussed awhile ago was to understand and recognize\n  the use of gold utori overlay on fittings, what is true &quot;utori&quot; and what is\n  not. \n\n  Jim Gilbert mentioned recently that he plans to be at the Tampa show this\n  year if all goes well. I don&#39;t recall just who all became involved in our\n  on-line discussion of &quot;utori&quot; but I for one, plan on bringing along a few\n  examples of what &quot;I&quot; call utori and also a few examples of what I have my\n  doubts about being &quot;true&quot; utori technique. Keep this in mind and if we can\n  gather a few of us together for a short while that weekend, maybe with Jim&#39;s\n  leadership we could all learn something about &quot;utori&quot; work. I will have a\n  table to sit down at or if not there, certainly a quiet corner can be found\n  somewhere there. I for one look forward to some discussion on this topic!\n\n  Ron\n  STL\n\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n\n    _____  \n\n  Yahoo!
