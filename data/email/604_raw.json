I found some toys claiming the owl as a symbol of good luck, but I have a feeling that these modern associations have more to do with marketing than historical accuracy.\n\nIn books and web I mostly found the negative meanings already posted, but these didn&#39;t make much sense in relation to sword mountings.  (Unless maybe as a memento mori type reminder that you might have to kill your own family members to get ahead.  True in the 16th C, but maybe not a very popular idea in the Confucian-minded Edo period.)\n\nIn Katherine Ball&#39;s &quot;Decorative Motives of Oriental Art&quot; I found a brief mention of the owl being noted for the ability to kill birds its own size.  In addition to the fierce hawks and occasional rooster, the first Jingo made at least one tsuba with an owl motif.  I suspect that the intended meaning of the owl may have been along the same lines of courage and martial spirit.\n\nI didn&#39;t find any exact homonyms for fukurou, but there are two kanji pronounced fukuro that mean &quot;a return trip.&quot;  No idea if that was intended, but returning home alive could certainly be an auspicious association.\n\nOddly I can&#39;t find fukurou listed in Tsuba Kodogu Gaidai Jiten.  \n\nJim\n\n\n\n  Playing around on google.com the following was taken from a site selling owl toys and things. it sounds more &quot;friendly&quot; than the earlier meanings associated with the owl and would seem more like what the sword owner wanted by placing the owl on his sword&#39;s fittings. Sorry...didn&#39;t intent to beat this to death...\n\n  PAMPAS GRASS HORNED OWL: SUSUKI-MIMIZUKU\n  Dating back 250 years, the familiar grass horned owl is said to help ward off sickness. Though the owl is generally regarded in Japan as malicious or at best useless, this particular toy is widely recognized for its benevolence. \n\n  For what it&#39;s worth...\n\n  Ron\n  STL\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
