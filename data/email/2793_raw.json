You&#39;re talking abou=\r\nt Hirata in Higo.  I&#39;m not aware of any connection between the groups other=\r\n than the shared name.\n\nHirata Hikozo did a lot of work in copper alloys.  =\r\nMost plates are yamagane or copper, but some are shinchu or shakudo.  Many =\r\nof them are lacquered.  The mimi edge you&#39;re talking about is a fukurin (ri=\r\nm cover) and Hikozo often used them, usually in a contrasting metal.  I thi=\r\nnk that you&#39;re describing an Odawara fukurin, which was a particular specia=\r\nlty of Hikozo.  Many Hirata guards have the concentric circle file marking =\r\nyou mention, but others have amida yasurime, irregular or polished surfaces=\r\n.  Many do have a distinctive taganemei of heavy, domed punch marks along t=\r\nhe sides of the nakago ana.\n\nI can&#39;t say what you have without seeing it.  =\r\nThere have been contemporary copies of Hikozo&#39;s work for sale at US sword s=\r\nhows recently.  I don&#39;t think that they were made to deceive since they are=\r\n very obviously brand new, shiny and not at all in the taste of the origina=\r\nl time and place.  On the other hand, a couple of them turned up at the Chi=\r\ncago shinsa, so someone may have gotten a little confused.  I have no idea =\r\nhow the sellers are representing these guards.\n\nJim\n\n\n\n  List-\n\n  I have re=\r\ncently been looking at a (non cloissone)\n  Hirata style tsuba: \n\n  -It is n=\r\not iron, but rather seems copper.\n  -It is plain, unmarked, with the plate =\r\nbeing covered\n  in dark lacquer.\n  -The mimi edge is done in a sort of silv=\r\ner or other\n  metal crimped onto the place and fashioned to look\n  slightly=\r\n like the edges of an abalone shell or other\n  mollusk &lt;sorry, I&#39;m not a ma=\r\nrine biologist&gt;.\n\n  ---All in all, sort of a common plain-jane Hirata\n  sty=\r\nle design. The seppa dai area does have those big\n  pock marks I see on Hir=\r\nata tsuba.\n\n  I am wondering if this is just a very late Hirata, a\n  Meiji =\r\nera export, or an attempt to imply Hirata &lt;I had\n  recently discussed a gi-=\r\ntaganamei Higo Kamiyoshi tsuba\n  with Jim G., in that the unsigned tsuba ha=\r\nd\n  hammermarks to imply it was the work of second\n  generation Kamiyoshi &quot;=\r\nFukanobu&quot;&gt;.\n     On what little I have seen and very little I know\n  of suc=\r\nh Hirata tsuba, they always have radial marks on\n  the plate to add to the =\r\ndesign impression of a shell.\n  This one been flat and black lacquered, see=\r\nms very\n  odd.\n\n  Thank you in advance to any replies,\n\n  Curran \n\n\n\n[Non-t=\r\next portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
