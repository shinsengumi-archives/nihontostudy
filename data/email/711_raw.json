It&#39;s been my (limited) experience that if a practice\nis done in one time period, it&#39;s usually been done in another.\nI would certainly suspect some of the &quot;guild&quot; schools like\nSukesada would have used it (pure speculation on my part).\n\nAlso, if it was a practice in earlier times, could this explain\nwhy some blades get gimei at shinsa even though the blade itself\nis a good example of the smiths work?\n\nRich S\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n Richard Stein, PhD          alchemyst@...\n      \n             The Japanese Sword Index\n  http://www.geocities.com/alchemyst/nihonto.htm\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n"
