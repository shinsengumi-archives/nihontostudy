Unfortunately it is a part of the learning curve assoc=\r\niated with this hobby.\n\nAs far as the dealers go, many of the people who ha=\r\nve tables at shows are not dealers.  They are collectors who are upgrading =\r\ntheir collections, just like you, in San Fran by selling pieces that have n=\r\nothing left to teach them and buying new ones that they hope to learn from.=\r\n  The majority of these people have the same limited knowledge selling thei=\r\nr items as you did buying it.\n\nI doubt if they had any intent to mislead yo=\r\nu, they just did not know any better.  Unfortunately this is true in most i=\r\nnstances.  The seller has very little idea as to what he or she is selling.=\r\n  This in my experience this applies equally to blades that are gime, and f=\r\nittings that are less than what they may be demonstrated as.\n\nThe dealers w=\r\nho make their living buying and selling swords and fittings know exactly wh=\r\nat they are selling, and if they should make a mistake, they will look afte=\r\nr you.\n\nIts all part of the learning curve.\n\nJohn\n\n\n\n\n  ----- Original Mess=\r\nage ----- \n  From: Elliott \n  To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Mon=\r\nday, November 06, 2006 8:44 AM\n  Subject: [nihontostudy] Re: my photo album=\r\n, pictures 19 and 20\n\n\n  Curran,\n\n  I apologize, I sometimes &#39;leap before l=\r\nooking&#39;!
