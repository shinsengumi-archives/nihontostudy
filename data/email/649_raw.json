In my career as an art conservator, we often manipulate images to bring\nout faint signatures, underdrawings of paintings, etc that are originally of low contrast.\nAlso, make sure your scanner is set at black and white, rather than a multi-color selection.\n\n-Doug Sanders\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
