LOL\n&gt; &gt;I live in New Brunswick on the east coast.\n&gt; Occasionally I&#39;ll make it out\n&gt; &gt;west to do some mountain climbing and I&#39;ve been\n&gt; down to New Hampshire, Mount\n&gt; &gt;Washington. Apart from that, I usually don&#39;t get\n&gt; state side. I can just see\n&gt; &gt;myself trying to explain to a customs officer that\n&gt; I&#39;m travelling to the\n&gt; &gt;U.S. to attend a Japanese Sword Show! LOL! I&#39;m\n&gt; going to need a passport next\n&gt; &gt;year just to cross the border into Maine so I can\n&gt; buy cheap milk!\n&gt; &gt;Where abouts  are you located John?\n&gt; &gt;Any information you can provide me with would be\n&gt; greatly appreciated. If\n&gt; &gt;anyone out there in Nihonto land wants to come to\n&gt; New Brunswick and share\n&gt; &gt;their knowledge, I will supply Beer and Lobsters.\n&gt; &gt;Now if there&#39;s going to be more than 10 of you or\n&gt; any international\n&gt; &gt;arrivals, (Andres), I will need some time to plan.\n&gt; &gt;Have a great holiday season everyone.

Most are $200 range, more or less. If\n&gt; you are new at this I\n&gt; &gt;would be happy to recommend good ones that would\n&gt; help teach you about these\n&gt; &gt;things. Some of these have been to a number of\n&gt; shows and are now kept home\n&gt; &gt;so that I can keep my table at the shows, fresh.\n&gt; All are authentic, for\n&gt; &gt;sure. The shows seem to have a wonderful selection\n&gt; of nice quality tsuba\n&gt; &gt;these days and that is good for the buyer, bad for\n&gt; the seller since there is\n&gt; &gt;such a &quot;selection&quot; to pick from. Anyway...just\n&gt; thought I&#39;d toss this idea\n&gt; &gt;out to you. I&#39;ve been around for going on 40\n&gt; years...gosh, that&#39;s a little\n&gt; &gt;frightening to put in writing!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Ron\n&gt; &gt;STL\n&gt; &gt;----- Original Message -----\n&gt; &gt;From: anwahi\n&gt; &gt;To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt;Sent: Wednesday, December 21, 2005 4:23 PM\n&gt; &gt;Subject: [nihontostudy] Where do you buy your\n&gt; Tsuba?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Hello,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;I&#39;m new here and to collecting Tsuba. Where do you\n&gt; buy your Tsuba from?\n&gt; &gt;I know there&#39;s several websites you can find with a\n&gt; Google search, an\n&gt; &gt;occasional Token Kai show like the one in SF, or\n&gt; Ebay (most look like\n&gt; &gt;junk). I&#39;m looking for good sources of authentic\n&gt; Tsuba. Obviously the\n&gt; &gt;only way to be really sure of authenticity is to\n&gt; purchase papered\n&gt; &gt;Tsuba, but because I&#39;m starting off I want some\n&gt; sources of authentic\n&gt; &gt;Tsuba more reasonably priced.
