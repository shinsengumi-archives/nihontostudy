While we have never met in\nperson, I corresponded with Mr. Han for many years and always found his\nletters full of scholarship and interesting insights. While there are now\nmore and more well informed and scholarly people outside Japan, I\nbelieve Mr. Han was without peer and his passing will leave a void that\nwill not be filled in the near future. His knowledge and analytical mind\nhas been noted widely inside Japan and out, and the sword community has\nlost a true friend. I understand that his latest work, a compendium of\nswords found and recorded in the Netherlands and rendered in English, is\nsoon to leave the printer. I am sure it will stand as a lasting monument\nto his scholarship. I extend my prayerful sympathy to all of those who\nknew him personally.\n\nArnold Frenzel\nafrenzel@...\n\n\nOn Wed, 24 Sep 2003, alchemyst wrote:\n\n&gt; Forward from Rich T&#39;s message board:\n&gt; \n&gt; I have just received an email from a Oranda Token Kai member telling \n&gt; me on the passing yesterday of Han Bing\n&gt;       Siong. He was well known for his pentrating erudite scholarly \n&gt; works that reguarly appeared in the English and\n&gt;       Japanese language sword journals like Token Bijutsu, JSS/US and \n&gt; Token Society of Great Britain. \n&gt; \n&gt;       I shall never forget how he answered every query I had however \n&gt; insignificant and always had time for the younger\n&gt;       element. He once wrote, &#39;I don&#39;t feel its a waste of time to \n&gt; answer any thing you ahve to write Yahya for you are next\n&gt;       generation that must carry on what he started after the war.&#39;\n&gt; \n&gt;       RIP good friend\n&gt; \n&gt;       We&#39;ll miss you.\n&gt; \n&gt;       Yahya Abdelsamad \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; nihontostudy-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
