Talking to the fellow prior to the visit, I felt he had t=\r\no be describing a &quot;ringer.&quot; You wouldn&#39;t believe what he all saw in that sw=\r\nord and how excited he was about this &quot;ancient&quot; sword! I did ask if he want=\r\ned &quot;the truth&quot; about if when he came over, and he said yes. It took a coupl=\r\ne hours and some show-and-tell to convince him. (He swore some Japanese off=\r\nered him $10K for this sword six months back!) \n\nMy question here today...t=\r\nhis sword had the typical &quot;etched&quot; hada that you could see from across the =\r\nroom. Has anyone figured out if these swords are being actually &quot;forged and=\r\n acid etched&quot; or if this so-called &quot;hada&quot; is applied and etched (probably s=\r\nimilar to fake damascus)? I couldn&#39;t say one way or the other 100% but susp=\r\nect it is &quot;applied.&quot; The nakago looked raw and certainly not something that=\r\n even a blacksmith would make. Odd kanji, etc., and unfinished. \n\nComments?=\r\n\n\nRon\nSTL\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: Ann-Marie \n  To: nihontos=\r\ntudy@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Friday, October 13, 2006 11:10 AM\n  Subject: =\r\nRe: [nihontostudy] Re: any comments about this sword?\n\n\n  this sword has ne=\r\nver been on ebay. and yes there are many fakes that look similar that are o=\r\nn ebay.\n\n\n\n\n  germanbudoka &lt;eckido@...&gt; wrote: --- In nihontostudy@yaho=\r\nogroups.com, &quot;molto10&quot; &lt;molto10@...&gt; wrote:\n  &gt;\n  &gt; www.geocities.com/molto=\r\n10/sword/sword.html\n  &gt;\n  If I remember good, this item was article in Ebay=\r\n one week ago.
