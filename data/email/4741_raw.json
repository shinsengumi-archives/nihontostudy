I&#39;ll look \n  into it=\r\n. I am a &quot;practitioner&quot;, although the weapon I mostly train \n  with is the =\r\nkatana. Nonetheless, I started training with naginata, \n  too, about, oh, 3=\r\n years ago. I&#39;m still a rank beginner, but I&#39;m very \n  much interested in i=\r\nt as a weapon. I also started training in Yari \n  around the same time. But=\r\n while I practice and learn katana waza \n  weekly, or sometimes more often,=\r\n I do naginata and yari maybe once a month.\n\n  Best Regards,\n\n  Andres\n\n  A=\r\nt 07:54 AM 12/8/2006, you wrote:\n  &gt;Hi Andres,\n  &gt; Nice to see someone else=\r\n out there interested in these\n  &gt;wonderful polearms. Knutsen&#39;s book is one=\r\n of the only ones in english that I\n  &gt;am aware of. Are you a &quot;practitioner=\r\n&quot; of Naginata or simply looking to study\n  &gt;them?\n  &gt;Another book you may w=\r\nant to look at is; Naginata - The Definitive Guide by\n  &gt;Dr. Alexander Benn=\r\nett. It is only available through;\n  &gt;HYPERLINK &quot;http://www.kendo-world.com=\r\n&quot;www.kendo-world.com A warning\n  &gt;though; the suppliers have a &quot;reputation&quot;=\r\n for being slow with their orders.\n  &gt;I placed an order 2 weeks ago and the=\r\nre hasn&#39;t been any movement on my\n  &gt;credit card or even an e-mail confirma=\r\ntion of my request. Expect a wait of\n  &gt;3-4 months! With that said, the boo=\r\nk comes with some glowing reviews since\n  &gt;anything on the subject in engli=\r\nsh is so rare. During the historical\n  &gt;developement of Japan, it&#39;s amazing=\r\n to see that the Katana took a backseat\n  &gt;to the Bow and Naginata.\n  &gt;\n  &gt;=\r\nMark\n  &gt;\n  &gt;\n  &gt;\n  &gt;-----Original Message-----\n  &gt;From: nihontostudy@yahoog=\r\nroups.com [mailto:nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com]On\n  &gt;Behalf Of Andres Pedra=\r\nza\n  &gt;Sent: Thursday, December 07, 2006 8:43 PM\n  &gt;To: nihonto@yahoogroups.=\r\ncom; nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com\n  &gt;Subject: [nihontostudy] Yari and Nagin=\r\nata\n  &gt;\n  &gt;\n  &gt;\n  &gt;Nihonto People,\n  &gt;\n  &gt;I haven&#39;t seen a whole lot of boo=\r\nks on Yari and/or Naginata in\n  &gt;English, so even though it was a bit pricy=\r\n, I purchased Roald and\n  &gt;Susan Knutsen&#39;s book ( HYPERLINK\n  &gt;&quot;http://tiny=\r\nurl.com/yxlhuj&quot;http://tinyurl.-com/yxlhuj). I just finished it.\n  &gt;I am ver=\r\ny impressed and sorry I did not purchase it earlier. The\n  &gt;concise yet inf=\r\normative text plus the wealth of drawings and plates\n  &gt;was well worth the =\r\nprice.\n  &gt;\n  &gt;If there&#39;s anyone else out there interested in the subject an=\r\nd that\n  &gt;has been on the fence about this great book because of the price =\r\ntag,\n  &gt;well, stop considering it and buy it. Give it to yourself for\n  &gt;Ch=\r\nristmas. You won&#39;t regret it.\n  &gt;\n  &gt;And if Roald and Susan subscribe to th=\r\nese lists (or someone who knows\n  &gt;them does) please receive a big thank yo=\r\nu from me... This book will\n  &gt;be a permanent part of my reference library.=\r\n\n  &gt;\n  &gt;Anyone have any other books on Yari and/or Naginata they want to\n  =\r\n&gt;recommend?
