I have seen \nthese spiralled wires on several occasions recently, they are pretty \ndistinct work I think. I am assuming these are separate pieces of wire \nthat are twisted and inserted and welded or whatever in place. I will \nlook around and see if I can find these, thought I think they were \nonline and may well be gone by now.\n\nRich\n\nRon Hartmann wrote:\n&gt; Hi Jim, all - \n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m curious about this iron tsuba which I&#39;ve placed in the photo album (Ron STL) named &quot;sworddad.&quot; Iron sukashi measuring 79.3 mm, squared edge, motif of grape leaves/grapes with vines, backside shows back of blossoms, etc. Heavy gold applied to flowers. What seems odd (I&#39;ve not seen this done before) is the use of wire to represent the &quot;feelers&quot; made intertwining with the thicker vines. \n&gt;\n&gt; All looks pretty Choshu to me but such a bold design, I wonder about Bizen Shoami, possibly. \n&gt;\n&gt; Opinions???\n&gt;\n&gt; http://tinyurl.com/rlno9\n&gt;\n&gt; Ron\n&gt; STL\n&gt;\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt; Yahoo!
