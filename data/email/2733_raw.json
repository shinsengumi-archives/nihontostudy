I am a newcomer to\nthe tsuba and have very little research material.  In other words, I\nknow very little.  What I really need to know is are they good or bad\n- what is their value if any.\n\nThe tsuba can be viewed at http://www.geocities.com/tsuba4sale/\n\nIf this is an inappropriate question for this group I apologize.  I\nreally have no resources nearby who can help me.  Several antique\ndealers have made offers but I just don&#39;t know enough [I know they are\ntsuba but thats it].  I have no use for them as I already have enough\nstuff.\n\n\nThank you in advance....\n\ntsuba4sale\n\n\n\n\n"
