I live in the north of the UK so it is=\r\n a long trip. I am sure it will be a good event. \n  Regarding your question=\r\n about Naokatsu and Kajihei, I have two swords which are relevant. The firs=\r\nt is a wakazashi which appears to be a copy of an O-suriage bizen blade whi=\r\nch has NBTHK green papers to Naokatsu. The second, and the one I am current=\r\nly investigating, appears to be an O-suriage tachi with a partial sayagaki =\r\nto Bizen Osafune Kagemitsu. However to me and others who have seen it it ap=\r\npears more likely to be a shin-shinto copy. The quality of the work, partic=\r\nularly the hada and the Utsuri suggests Naokatsu but in trying to prove it =\r\nthe name of Kajihei cropped up. It appears he was a very accomplished smith=\r\n initially making copies of shinto pieces of both Kotetsu and Inoue Shinkai=\r\n and more latterly by Osafune school smiths. The grey area appears to be in=\r\n his intent. Where Naotane, Naokatsu etc made copies Kajihei appears to hav=\r\ne made counterfeits which were intended to deceive. There are apparently ma=\r\nny Kotestsu blades by this smith and at least one book has been\n published =\r\nin the past of Oshigatas of his work.\n  If the sword under study is by him =\r\nthen I have no doubt that he was an incredible smith. I find it very sad th=\r\nat such talent should be used to deceive either through circumstance or mal=\r\nice.\n\nRon Hartmann &lt;swords@...&gt; wrote:\n          Paul - \n\nNo info=\r\n for you but I did want to mention that I&#39;m doing an exhibit on Naokatsu (a=\r\nnd other shinshinto smiths loaned by others) at the upcoming Minneapolis sh=\r\now and shinsa on the 15th. I&#39;m curious if you have a sword by this fellow K=\r\najihei and if so, are you attending this show? It promises to be a very int=\r\neresting &quot;cultural&quot; weekend taking in lots of other interests than swords. =\r\nShould be good!\n\nRon\nSTL\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: paul bowman \nT=\r\no: study group \nSent: Sunday, June 03, 2007 10:30 AM\nSubject: [nihontostudy=\r\n] Kajihei\n\nDear All, \nIm looking for information on Kajihei, the son/studen=\r\nt of Jiritaro Naokatsu. \nHe seems to have a mixed reputation in that he was=\r\n a highly skilled smith but specilaised in making counterfeit blades of top=\r\n Koto and Shinto smiths. \nTrying to work out whether he was a victim of the=\r\n times trying to survive the downturn in demand for swords or just a dishon=\r\nest but highly skilled crook. \nAll information/ leads gratefully received. =\r\n\nthanks \nPaulB\n\n---------------------------------\nAll New Yahoo!
