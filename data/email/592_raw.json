I\n&gt; think something to keep in mind here is &quot;where are you\n&gt; going with your restoration project?&quot;  I have learned\n&gt; that hard way that Japanese-like is really not the\n&gt; same as Japanese, and, of course, the worst place to\n&gt; learn this kind of lesson is at shinsa.  Because\n&gt; everybody tends to want to dump pieces (as much or\n&gt; more koshirae as swords) which don&#39;t paper, I find\n&gt; there is a general reluctance to talk about the whole\n&gt; restoration process in the context of what I might\n&gt; label as &quot;external&quot; or &quot;Japanese market&quot; valuations of\n&gt; &quot;sword stuff&quot; (so we can encompass just blades, just\n&gt; fittings, fitting sets, and fully mounted blades).\n&gt;   If all you want to do is have a katana-like thing\n&gt; with which to practice iaido, then you might be better\n&gt; off with an iaito from Tozando.  Where things start to\n&gt; get blurry is when you have to use a &quot;real&quot; shinken.\n&gt; Many of who didn&#39;t get into the sword market early or\n&gt; wisely enough to buy good Nihonto when they were more\n&gt; plentiful and less expensive will migrate from replica\n&gt; type things which are not Japanese swords at all to\n&gt; gunto re-mounted buke-zukuri style.\n&gt;    Nothing wrong with that.  In fact for a tamesh-giri\n&gt; blade I would argue that is a good thing, because it\n&gt; avoids the possibility of damaging a blade with\n&gt; artistic and historical value.  However, as Chris can\n&gt; easily explain to you, &quot;gunto&quot; actually pertains to\n&gt; the mounts and there are swords from the Second World\n&gt; War which were made using traditional materials and\n&gt; methods and trashing one of these blades would be as\n&gt; unfortunate as wrecking an older blade.\n&gt;    The other thing is that if you are a martial\n&gt; artist, things can easily get a bit blurry over time.\n&gt; You can get conceptually sloppy, not be as serious\n&gt; about your collecting and restoration as you are about\n&gt; your practice.  The result is often a lot of small\n&gt; investments because you cannot afford the larger ones,\n&gt; only to look back a decade or so later and realize\n&gt; that all of those little purchases which generally\n&gt; amount to little or no cumulative value, were they\n&gt; simply done at one time, would have gotten you a fine\n&gt; sword in serviceable, collectable Edo period mounts.\n&gt;    Admittedly, not everything that is collectable is\n&gt; suitable for use - much of it should be relegated (or\n&gt; delegated) to pure connoisseurship, and if you have a\n&gt; blade which is a real &quot;work horse&quot;, you need several\n&gt; expert opinions if you want a blade which is (a)\n&gt; authentic (b) safe (c) not likely to be damaged by\n&gt; practice.  Having said all that, I had a very\n&gt; interesting experience recently which only reinforces\n&gt; my feeling that wherever it is even remotely feasible,\n&gt; you should at the very least aspire to having the real\n&gt; thing and not follow what has been aptly described to\n&gt; me as &quot;blind alleys&quot; of restoration.\n&gt;    I picked up a blade here in New Hampshire about 4\n&gt; years ago from a local dealer.  It was part of a trade\n&gt; I was working out with a guy who was going to do some\n&gt; paintings for me.  He wanted a koto blade in pretty\n&gt; good polish, so it took a while to find him something\n&gt; which would meet his criteria.  Eventually one of the\n&gt; guys here turned up an O-suriage ni-shaku blade with a\n&gt; very bad gimei of &quot;Nagamitsu&quot; but which while somewhat\n&gt; tired had a pleasantly bright habuchi, good hataraki\n&gt; and the &quot;blue&quot; of good Kyushu steel which comes not\n&gt; from Nugui but from some particular combination of\n&gt; alloys which Barry Hennick, Roger Robertshaw or Rich\n&gt; Stein could explain better than could I. In any case,\n&gt; I had figured it for maybe Higo Enju, seems that it is\n&gt; actually Yamato ko-Naminohira (Kyushu branch of Yamato\n&gt; den).\n&gt;    Anyway, the guy for whom I bought the blade didn&#39;t\n&gt; care about the gimei, among other things because he\n&gt; can&#39;t read signatures and while he has a lot of swords\n&gt; (many times the number I have) he doesn&#39;t really care\n&gt; to know too much about them.  In the end our art deal\n&gt; didn&#39;t work out and the blade in shirasaya came back\n&gt; to me.\n&gt;    It&#39;s not of a size for me to be swinging around\n&gt; much (my Japanese students all want it, and they can&#39;t\n&gt; have it but that&#39;s a different story) but while it&#39;s a\n&gt; tired old warhorse, it does have about 600 years of\n&gt; age on it, and I felt some intrinsic resonance with\n&gt; the blade.  This is all personal, subjective stuff,\n&gt; but without that stuff, I fear few of us would\n&gt; collect.  Since I decided to keep the blade, I sent it\n&gt; to Cary to have the gimei removed.  Chris Bowen has\n&gt; guys in Japan who can do that for you as well.  The\n&gt; thing is that a professional mei removal is well worth\n&gt; the expense, because if done right, and if the nakago\n&gt; is properly repatinated/filed (the older the blade,\n&gt; the less filing that needs to be done, but the more\n&gt; complex and difficult the process of matching the\n&gt; existing texture is) then the blade is, in fact,\n&gt; RESTORED to what should have been its natural\n&gt; condition.\n&gt;    I would argue this goes for mounting blades as\n&gt; well.  If you are just looking for something to swing\n&gt; in class, then you might be concerned about safety or\n&gt; price first.  Do yourself a favor and don&#39;t confound\n&gt; this with authenticity.  There are a variety of views\n&gt; about why one would learn the Japanese sword arts and\n&gt; at one end of the spectrum you have the argument that\n&gt; if you are going to accurately preserve the art, then\n&gt; you should use the actual weapons in their actual\n&gt; amounts (I can see Clive Sinclair having a heart\n&gt; attack as he reads this, so let me qualify that by\n&gt; saying you should also have someone who knows better\n&gt; than you do advise you on what blades are suitable for\n&gt; various kinds of practice and which blades should not\n&gt; be handled in any way other than as rare\n&gt; collectables).\n&gt; At the other end, you have guys ordering perfectly\n&gt; serviceable blades from makers either here or in Japan\n&gt; who specialize in making weapons pretty much for every\n&gt; level and type of martial arts practice that you could\n&gt; envision.  If you&#39;re a martial artist, you eventually\n&gt; need to unbundle or &quot;unblur&quot; these distinctions and\n&gt; figure out what blade or blades you want or need, what\n&gt; they are and for what purpose are you collecting them.\n&gt; As a point of principle I would say that the\n&gt; non-martial artist needs to do this (hopefully sooner\n&gt; rather than later - which is where study comes in) as\n&gt; well.\n&gt;    A good experience for me has been the restoration\n&gt; on this Naminohira katana.  We really started from\n&gt; somewhere around &quot;less than zero&quot;.  An old blade in a\n&gt; fairly inexpensive shirasaya, gimei and no other\n&gt; fittings.  After Cary removed the bad mei and while we\n&gt; were waiting for the nakago repatination (it takes a\n&gt; few weeks) I sent him some tsuba for possible mounting\n&gt; pieces.  He picked out a Heianjo piece, not too far\n&gt; removed in time from when the blade was made and used\n&gt; that as the centerpiece from which to assemble and\n&gt; restore period koshirae.  Admittedly, I have a bit of\n&gt; an advantage here because knowing me, Cary could\n&gt; assemble mounts which in his words reflected both the\n&gt; spirit of the tsuba (as the centerpiece of the\n&gt; koshirae) and the personality of the owner.  That&#39;s\n&gt; just a bonus issue for me.  What is more important is\n&gt; that when I got the blade back, the whole package\n&gt; possessed the kind of harmony and authenticity you\n&gt; would immediately recognize as literally &quot;museum\n&gt; quality&quot;.  It&#39;s a nice (if rather tired) late 14th\n&gt; century blade in early-mid edo mounts &quot;en-suite&quot; fully\n&gt; restored, yet looking as if the whole package had been\n&gt; sitting in someone&#39;s home as a family treasure,\n&gt; mounted just as you see it, for the last three or four\n&gt; hundred years.\n&gt;    That&#39;s what I would call true &quot;restoration&quot;.  It&#39;s\n&gt; not just &quot;mounting up&quot; a blade (for practice or\n&gt; display) but is the process of creating an artistic\n&gt; whole which is demonstrably (the visual impact is\n&gt; basically &quot;wow&quot;, particularly if you know how this\n&gt; piece started out) more than the sum of its parts.\n&gt;    The last fifty years of sword collecting (if not\n&gt; much of the last five hundred years) seem to be\n&gt; characterized by a kind of dealers&#39; reverse mentality\n&gt; (I had a blade at one time which had been messed with\n&gt; during the Edo period to look like a Heian piece, so I\n&gt; know from experience that this kind of messing with\n&gt; blades has been going on for long and long) where the\n&gt; parts are worth more broken up than they are as an\n&gt; artistic whole.  While that might be economically true\n&gt; (and as often as not it&#39;s even a bad economic\n&gt; decision) it&#39;s an artistic travesty.  Another thing I\n&gt; did this month was manage to re-unite a Dai-Sho tsuba\n&gt; set which had been separated at least a hundred years\n&gt; ago.  One piece wound up in Canada and from there made\n&gt; its way to the U.S.  The other piece was in an\n&gt; European collection.  Neither owner even knew that\n&gt; their tsuba was part of a matched pair.  I can only\n&gt; speculate about what the swords and the other fittings\n&gt; might have been like (pretty good, I imagine if they\n&gt; still exist).\n&gt;    It is so easy in collecting to unknowingly and\n&gt; unintentionally destroy, it is rare and difficult to\n&gt; rejuvenate, recover and restore.  And as Chris has\n&gt; been telling us for years, restoration means a whole\n&gt; lot more than sending that rusty &quot;junker&quot; to an\n&gt; amateur polisher and then cobbling together enough\n&gt; bits and pieces of tosogu to create a mounted piece.\n&gt;   Admittedly, it might not matter to some people\n&gt; wether they are creating or destroying and they are\n&gt; more concerned about what they have (and how cheaply\n&gt; they got it) than they are about their piece having\n&gt; any kind of artistic integrity.  I had a very\n&gt; frustrating experience of this sort a few years ago.\n&gt; I had acquired (and still have) a very good Mito\n&gt; school sentoku tsuba (at least Ogawa Morihiro sensei\n&gt; said it was a very good Mito piece) and while I was\n&gt; visiting David Hamilton in New Mexico, he was wrapping\n&gt; a tsuka for a local gun dealer, which happened to have\n&gt; the identical (we can talk microscopic level here\n&gt; folks, I mean identity as in exact congruence not\n&gt; relative similarity) fuchi kashira (pretty obviously\n&gt; all disassembled from the same sword).  We tried\n&gt; everything we could think of to get those pieces back\n&gt; together - offered him the tsuba way below market -\n&gt; offered to by the fuchi-kashira way above market and\n&gt; pay for a new handle for him - all in vain.  He just\n&gt; wanted his piece and that was it.  Where it came from\n&gt; or where it was going was none of our business. Once\n&gt; humpty dumpty falls apart, reassembly is often\n&gt; difficult if not impossible.  As Stephen King says,\n&gt; &quot;you can&#39;t unring the bell&quot;.\n&gt;   So if you have a blade you are thinking about\n&gt; mounting or re-mounting, I would urge you to do it\n&gt; right the first time.  You have two guys easily to\n&gt; hand - Cary in San Francisco and Chris in Japan, both\n&gt; web accessible (http://www.ikkyudo.com and\n&gt; http://www.ejapaneseswords.com) who specialize in\n&gt; precisely what I&#39;ve been describing - restoration\n&gt; which is an act of art and an act of creation.\n&gt; Between the two of them their specializations are\n&gt; different enough that I regard them as complementary\n&gt; rather than competitive.  Of course, the older guys on\n&gt; the list know this already.  If you know Brian\n&gt; Tsernaga (sp?) or John Tirado and can get into their\n&gt; schedule, they are active participants in the\n&gt; authentic restoration process. But for the rest of us,\n&gt; it&#39;s a lot easier to go to one guy who has built a\n&gt; career specializing in authentic blades and\n&gt; restoration than to chase down all the individual\n&gt; pieces.  Different strokes.  When I was collecting\n&gt; gunto, Fred Lohman&#39;s service was perfect for me, and\n&gt; if you&#39;re mounting an oil-tempered gunto he&#39;s still\n&gt; the guy to go to.  If you want a traditional blade\n&gt; made with traditional materials and methods then go to\n&gt; Chris, who has modern blades covered, beginning with\n&gt; the opening of the Tatara in 1933 right through the\n&gt; current works of the Gassan school, or to Cary who\n&gt; specializes in older blades, Juyo Token and blades of\n&gt; Juyo quality which for relatively small reasons\n&gt; (sometimes nonsensically small from my point of view)\n&gt; didn&#39;t get a Juyo paper and so trade in the market at\n&gt; a quarter of the price of their indistinguishable\n&gt; counterparts.\n&gt;     As Mike Blue, Bill Latham, Mutsyhr Yee and Keith\n&gt; Larman can tell you, there are other approaches you\n&gt; can take (and they really speak for what I would\n&gt; characterize as &quot;schools of thought&quot; beyond their own\n&gt; swordmaking endeavors).  I happen to like old blades,\n&gt; so having a tired old 14th century blade brought back\n&gt; to life in stunning period koshirae does it for me.\n&gt; But I&#39;ve seen what top notch shinsakuto look like and\n&gt; if you&#39;re not hung up on the historical dimension as I\n&gt; am, then those blades should knock your socks off (not\n&gt; to mention Chris&#39; point that you do then have the\n&gt; advantage of knowing exactly who made your blade, and\n&gt; when and where they made it, quite possibly even that\n&gt; they made it specifically for you).\n&gt;    My thought here, and my reason for posting,\n&gt; particularly for posting at length, when I normally\n&gt; confine myself to lurking punctuated by intermittent\n&gt; lapses of sarcasm is that I thought it worth sharing\n&gt; my sentiment that a proper blade (and in the interests\n&gt; of the art, I&#39;m not going to be exclusionary and try\n&gt; and tell you specifically what that is, because it\n&gt; does have an element which is different from person to\n&gt; person)is worth the expense it takes to have one\n&gt; properly mounted, whether you can afford it or not\n&gt; (and as a professor, I&#39;m quite sure I fall into that\n&gt; latter category).\n&gt;    Nothing wrong with gunto (I used to collect them\n&gt; myself) or Tozando Iaito.  But don&#39;t confuse them with\n&gt; the profoundly different experience of owning a true\n&gt; Nihonto with truly matched koshirae.  I think I\n&gt; probably paid about twice as much for the restoration\n&gt; and mounting of my Naminohira katana as I did for the\n&gt; bare blade.  I think the combined package yields me\n&gt; far more satisfaction than the combined price, and\n&gt; that satisfaction is one which can&#39;t be duplicated by\n&gt; a pick and choose, catch as catch can approach.  If\n&gt; you assemble your own hybrid then nobody, probably not\n&gt; even you can really make sense of what it is you have\n&gt; at the end of the day (and it may not be something\n&gt; from which sense can later be made, even by you, as I\n&gt; have learned to my discomfort on more than one\n&gt; occasion).  If you&#39;re willing to make the stretch to\n&gt; Japanese quality standards, then there&#39;s an intrinsic\n&gt; artistic reward which is not otherwise replicable.\n&gt;    That&#39;s the gist of my $0.015 on restoration.  When\n&gt; you don&#39;t have expert knowledge of what you&#39;re doing,\n&gt; your best bet is to go to someone who does rather than\n&gt; to try and do it yourself, pick and choose. Having\n&gt; said that, I&#39;m now going back to lurk mode and working\n&gt; on my &quot;white lung disease&quot; between bouts of\n&gt; statistical and quantum mechanics.\n&gt;\n&gt; Cheers,\n&gt;\n&gt; Shirogitsune\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; __________________________________\n&gt; Do you Yahoo!?\n&gt; SBC Yahoo!
