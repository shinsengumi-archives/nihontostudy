I have been \nwondering for some time now why there we=\r\nre transitions in size of \ntsuba during the Nanbokucho to Momoyama Jidai an=\r\nd would like to know \nif one of the members could help pull this together f=\r\nor me.  It seems \nto make sense that shorter one-hand use swords would requ=\r\nire smaller \ntsuba and I believe that this would explain some of the smalle=\r\nr tsuba \nsuch as some Kanayama pieces one finds during the Muromachi and \nM=\r\nomoyama.  It&#39;s just bothered me that we start with very large Tosho \npieces=\r\n then see much smaller ones, then move to larger sukashi ones \nas we move t=\r\nhrough the warring states period.  Any help much \nappreciated.\n\n&quot;Historical=\r\nly, the emergence of the usage of the term &quot;wakizashi&quot; to \nrefer to &quot;an est=\r\nablished category of swords within a specific range \nof length (measured by=\r\n the distance between the ha-machi and the \nkissaki)&quot; that were commonly an=\r\nd officially (after the Tokugawa \nShogunate had issued an executive order) =\r\nworn by the samurai is \nrelatively a new phenomenon. In fact, it was only a=\r\nfter the beginning \nof the shin-to period, thus mainly post-Muromachi and e=\r\nspecially Edo \nperiod. Prior to this, that is when the samurai&#39;s &quot;main swor=\r\nd&quot; had \nbeen a tachi (i.e, ko-to, thus pre-Muromachi period), they most oft=\r\nen \nused to &quot;wear&quot; different types of &quot;side/peripheral swords such \nas &quot;yor=\r\noi-doshi&quot; (by inserting between obi), &quot;chiisa-gatana&quot; (by \ninserting betwee=\r\nn obi) and &quot;koshi-gatana&quot; (by mostly inserting \nbetween obi, but sometimes =\r\nhanging it from obi) (Ogasawara, 1994b).\n[Note. For the academic and histor=\r\nical classification of &quot;chisa-\ngatana,&quot; and its relations to &quot;koshi-gatana&quot;=\r\n and &quot;tanto,&quot; see \nOgasawara, 1994a and 1994b.]&quot;\n\n\n\n"
