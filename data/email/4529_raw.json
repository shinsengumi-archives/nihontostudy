Haynes\n\nSoten Tsuba\n=\r\nThe first Soten lived in Kyoto in his early life.  Later, he moved to \nHiko=\r\nne in Omi Province and worked there about the Kyoho era (1716-\n36).  He rec=\r\neived many orders from Kyoto and was obliged to travel \nback and forth betw=\r\neen the two cities.  No matter which city he \nworked in, he would sign as a=\r\n resident of Hikone.\n\nThe first Soten had many students who helped him prod=\r\nuce Soten style \ntsuba.  In fact, during his lifetime, the demand for his s=\r\ntyle of \ntsuba became so great that he and his school could not keep up wit=\r\nh \nthe orders.  In Kyoto, the Hiragiya school and, in Aizu, the Shoami \nsch=\r\nool, made Soten style tsuba to help fill the orders for the many \nrequests =\r\nreceived from all parts of the country.\n\nThere are several opinions concern=\r\ning the number of generations of \nthe main line Soten masters.  Some say th=\r\nere were two, or that there \nwere three, or even more.  The most logical is=\r\n two.\n\nThe first Soten signed his early work Shuten.  The second generation=\r\n \nused only the name Soten.  In addition to these two artists there are \nat=\r\n least twenty-five well-known students who signed their work with \ntheir ow=\r\nn names, and innumerrable students who signed with the name \nSoten, or did =\r\nnot sign their work at all.  A student of note is \nSoshu, an above average =\r\nworker, but the most famous student is Nomura \nKanenori:  his best work is =\r\nabout equal to that of the seond Soten.\n\nThere are slight differeces betwee=\r\nn the signatures of the first and \nsecond Soten.  The first signed with kan=\r\nji of about average size.  \nThe second used kanji slightly smaller than the=\r\n size of the first.  \nThere are other differences in their work, such as th=\r\ne designs of the \nsecond being more picturesque and detailed.  The surface =\r\nof his plate \nis very busy and brilliant; the design covering the major por=\r\ntion of \nthe web area.  The first also used small figures in the designs bu=\r\nt \nhe did not cover as much of the web area with his decoration.  He did \nn=\r\not use as much inlay of gold and silver.  From the style of carving \nused m=\r\nainly by the second Soten this school has come to be called \nHikonebori sch=\r\nool.\n\nShape:  round/oval\nPlate Metal:  the first used iron plate.  The seco=\r\nnd used iron, and \nin some cases shakudo plate.\nCarving:  human figures, la=\r\nndscapes, flowers and birds, historical \nsubjects of either Chinese of Japa=\r\nnese derivation.  The inlay is \nusually gold, copper, silver, and shakudo. =\r\n Human faces will be \neither silver or copper inlay.  Both masters used pur=\r\ne silver for \ntheir inlay.\nSigniture:  Goshu Hikone no Ju Shoheishi Niudo S=\r\noten Sei.  He also \nsigned with a very long signiture:  Goshu Hikone Nakaya=\r\nbu no Ju \nSoheishi Niudo Kitagawa Soten Sei.\n\nSummary:\nThe first and second=\r\n Soten were splendid at their chosen style.  The \niron is of good quality b=\r\nut the tempering is quite common.  The \nnikubori is inferior.  He tried to =\r\ncover this fault in the iron \nquality by making a good edge and using fine =\r\ndecoration.  Although \ntheir work is usually on iron plate, the plate is su=\r\nbordinate to the \ndecoration.  Their work should be judged on the quality o=\r\nf the \ncarving, inlay and designs.\n\nLater Soten Tsuba:\nThe majority of the =\r\nwork in the style of this school is but poor \nimitation made by shiiremono =\r\nmakers in the late Edo age at the docks \nof Yokohama.  These imitations acc=\r\nount for more than ninety-five \npercent of all Soten tsuba extant.  Even th=\r\ne best work of the \nstudents, though not common, is usually only slightly b=\r\netter than the \nshiiremono examples.  The work of this school was so corrup=\r\nted that a \ntrue idea of the real Soten tsuba is almost impossible to obtai=\r\nn.  It \nis unfortunate that the best work of this school has come under the=\r\n \nsame pale of suspicion that surrounds the common work of the \nimmitators.=\r\n  Had the work of this school been less papular, the true \nwork of the firs=\r\nt and second Soten might be regarded with more \nrespect than it now receive=\r\ns.\nauthors note:  the term Hikonebori means the original style of \ncarving =\r\nof the Soten school.  It is a combination of low relief, line \ncarving, som=\r\ne shishiai, detailed iroye inlay and elaborate openwork.  \nIn reality it is=\r\n but one type of ubu-zukashi, and is found rarely in \nthe early work of the=\r\n first and second Soten.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
