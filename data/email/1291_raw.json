One is\n&gt; with Gama Senin- a mythical sage who is often seen\n&gt; with a toad on his shoulder.  Sort of his\n&gt; familiar.\n&gt; The other is the story of Ono-no-tofu, whereby a\n&gt; would-be civil servant is encouraged to try once\n&gt; again at taking his exams after watching a frog\n&gt; perservere in his attempts to jump out of a pond,\n&gt; up a steep bank.  A frog could therefore be seen as\n&gt; a symbol of perserverance.  \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; -Doug Sanders\n&gt; &gt;    At the same time I saw these two odd-guys, I\n&gt; saw a\n&gt; &gt; tsuba with another stylized frog / toad wearing a\n&gt; &gt; similar quirked expression. An wise man or priest\n&gt; was\n&gt; &gt; standing in the backgound overlooking the frog\n&gt; with a\n&gt; &gt; jovial look on his face.\n&gt; &gt;    I did no know if there was a story here. Other\n&gt; than\n&gt; &gt; Kermit, I&#39;m not too fond of frogs.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Curran\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- Jim Gilbert &lt;jggilbert@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Curran,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; For what it&#39;s worth I used to have a pair of\n&gt; menuki\n&gt; &gt; &gt; in exactly that &quot;pose&quot; that were signed on the\n&gt; edge\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Yoshioka Inabanosuke.  They were better quality\n&gt; than\n&gt; &gt; &gt; these appear to be, and were not what I&#39;d think\n&gt; of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; as typical Yoshioka group work.  It can be tough\n&gt; to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; attribute a lot of the unsigned later menuki to\n&gt; a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; specific group.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Jim\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   Groups-\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   Came across these unusual menuki. Figured it\n&gt; might\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   interest some others.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; http://www.l-wise.co.jp/sword/sdata24/clk259b.htm\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   Any chance anyone can attribute this ugly duo\n&gt; to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; any\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   specific school? I&#39;m assuming they are late\n&gt; late\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Edo\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   or Meiji.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   Curran\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been\n&gt; &gt; &gt; removed]\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; __________________________________\n&gt; &gt; Do you Yahoo!?\n&gt; &gt; New Yahoo!
