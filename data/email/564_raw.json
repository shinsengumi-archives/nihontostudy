Owari guards can show elongated or &quot;linear&quot; tekkotsu when compared to Kanayama&#39;s &quot;bumpy&quot; tekkotsu for example, but it looks quite different from senkotsu.  Easier to show than to describe.  \n\nIn Akasaka guards that have been rusted and cleaned, the join between the plates can be very prominent.  Most early examples will show it in some places around the rim, but not others.  Some do not show it.  Some early ones have tekkotsu, but I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever seen a piece with both features together.  I have to wonder whether the ones with tekkotsu are the predecessors.\n\nI can&#39;t think of any examples of pre-Edo period work with senkotsu, so to that extent it would aid in dating.\n\nThere are guards that show a many-layered lamination in the rim.  It looks something like a puff pastry crust.  I don&#39;t think that that feature is described as senkotsu, but it&#39;s also seen in Edo period work.\n\nAnyone have different observations?\n\nJim\n\n\n\n  Jim,\n\n  Does one see Senkotsu in Owari tsubas?  Does the presence of Senkotsu aid in dating?\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
