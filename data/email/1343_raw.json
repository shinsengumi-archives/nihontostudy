I don&#39;t know if it\n&gt; would stand a chance of going Juyo, but I think that it\n&gt; should be submitted if only just for the experience which\n&gt; would be very educational in my opinion...\n\n&quot;...should be submitted if only just for the experience...&quot; - With the recent\nincreases in shinsa costs I believe this experience (of submitting a sword to\nthe NBTHK Juyo shinsa) can cost US$3,000 over and above &quot;the education&quot;??  And\nit must first pass the Tokubetsu Hozon shinsa.  I would think that very, very\nfew swords could go straight from Hozon to the Juyo shinsa.  All in all, VERY\nexpensive.  Friends of mine have tried in aggregate FOUR times for Juyo shinsa\nand 3 failed.  Payment is in advance and no refund if your sword doesn&#39;t &quot;get\nup&quot;.\n\nA mate of mine was in Japan staying with his polisher.  The togishi was\nrepolishing a sword that was already Juyo - ALREADY JUYO, note.  It was being\nrepolished because there were features of that particular smith that were not\nevident in its present state of polish as a Juyo-ranked sword.  The repolish was\nsuccessful as the sword made Tokubetsu Juyo and the polisher won an annual prize\nfor the work.\n\nBest regards,\n\nBarry Thomas\n(Melbourne, Australia)\n\n\n"
