I first wondered if maybe a drop in the cost of iron production was responsible for the later proliferation of iron tsuba.  But when you look at the list of individuals who gave their tachi to Oyamazumi, they could obviously afford whatever they wanted on their swords.  These are rather undecorated mounts, so I&#39;d guess that there was some perceived functional advantage rather than just a display of status and/or aesthetics at play.\n\nI&#39;d also guess that the nerikawa tsuba took more time and labor to make (curing, soaking, gluing, drying...fitting a fukurin...).  Iron guards were probably quicker to make, but the cost of the material (including fuel) would be higher.  It&#39;d take some research into the economies of the time to figure out and answer.  \n\nI&#39;d guess that kawa would also be expensive in the sense that it&#39;d need to be replaced more frequently than iron.  Getting a tsuba made of it wet would not be a good idea, for example.  It may be that the durability of iron is what made it more attractive for the lower status mounts.\n\nSpeculation sure is fun...\nJim\n\n\n\n  I wonder what the cost\n  of a lacquered leather tsuba would be in relation to an iron disk during\n  Heian and Kamakura?\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
