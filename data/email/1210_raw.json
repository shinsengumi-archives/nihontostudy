The only example I can think of that&#39;s a hard data point is a tsuba in the Boston Museum collection.  It&#39;s number 354 in the Ogawa catalog.  It is a piece that has nakago, kozuka and kogai ana that are typical of a guard made for a Japanese sword.  I don&#39;t see any evidence that it was made for another type of sword and modified for nihonto use.  Quoting from the catalog, this tsuba is signed:\n\n&quot;Nan-ching yu -- Ch&#39;ang Lo-chiao tsao K&#39;ang-hsi (ting) - wei (sui) Ch&#39;ang Lo-chiao tsao\n\n(Residing in Nanking, made by Ch&#39;ang Lo-chiao.  Made in the [ting]-sheep [year] of K&#39;ang-hsi [1667] by Ch&#39;ang Lo-chiao)&quot;\n\nIt is not in one of the typical &quot;Nanban&quot; tsuba styles, but there is some of that taste to it in the overlapping foliage motif.  Can anyone discuss or dispute the reading of the signature?  Any comments on the guard?\n\nThe text mentions another example signed with the same name.  I found one unsigned example with the same decorative motif and workmanship.\n\nI don&#39;t remember seeing any guards for Chinese swords with signatures.  Has anyone?\n\nJim\n\n\n\n\n  Now on to your question.\n\n  Over the past couple of years, I have gotten quite interested in tsuba that\n  seem - to me - to show direct influence between Japanese and foreign\n  swords. In generic terms these are assigned to the &quot;Namban&quot; style. Within\n  that categories there are masses of clearly Japanese stuff. Then there are\n  some guards that seem to have obvious referents to European rapiers or\n  smallsword guards. And then there are  guards that have been adapted for\n  use with Japanese blades altho they also seem to be of Chinese manufactures\n  These come in two type - at least. First there are some cupped tsuba that\n  seem to have been made in China and used in Japan. The other type is more\n  classically &quot;Namban&quot; but with no sign of accommodation to nippon-to. And\n  they show up in placed like Tibet and Nepal.\n  To my eye, these tsuba show diverse international influence that is not\n  surprising, given the way East Asia worked in the 16th and 17th century.\n  John Lissenden wrote a very interesting MA thesis on this school at the\n  University of Durham, last year. I am sure that he will try to see it\n  published, but that has not happened yet. Beyond that there is a lot of\n  other discussion of these issues whenever the Namban category is described.\n\n  Best of luck\n  P. Bleed\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
