As an addendum to my earlier comments, I burned \nup a Lohman polishing kit ($550) on full polishes for three gunto, \nplus some minor polishes on a few others.  The Kumemune was a \npleasant surprise (crusty rust over relatively minor pitting).  The \nMasamura was more typical (crusty rust over deep pitting).  This \nbrings me to Personal Rule #1 re pitting on rusty swords: &quot;It is \nalways deeper than you think.&quot;  Even light white frosting has pitting \ninvolved, properly requiring the use of foundation stones in my \nexperience.  Hence Personal Rule #2: &quot;Never buy rusty swords.&quot;  \n(Unless, of course, a sword is still a bargain with the price of a \nprofessional polish included, which is a big roll of the dice, \nconsidering on what may show up during a major repolish.)  JMHO.\n\nNC\n\n\n"
