Now my attempt to name the schools.\n\nI have no idea what school the rat is from.\n\nsu1 is most likely a kyo piece see nicer much finer (thinner work) \n@(Artswords.com the page was down for maintenance or I would have given the direct link) \nor a copy of a kyo piece (the two ovoid anna are significant of a particular \nschool are they not? I&#39;m too lazy to mull through all my texts right now to \nfind what school it is) I liked this piece but just didn&#39;t bid enough at the \nend, oh well.\n\nsu3 is late owari (my guess without dimensions or thickness)\n\nsu5 could be Tosa or Shoami and a long shot would be Akasaka.  I would have \nto say it is most likely Tosa with all that fine engraving on it.\n\nThese are my guesses Milt, now you see how little I know.  Would love to hear \nwhat you think they are Milt.  Also would like to hear from the experts to \nlearn a little something.\n\nLou\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
