I have recently acquired a sword that seems worthy and interesting enough to warrant a Japanese polish, a saya/habaki and submission for papers.  Despite I have seen the details of this process a few times on this list, I don&#39;t remember everything, and I certainly don&#39;t know the chronology of events and their respective costs (approximate) and the amount of time involved.\n\nCould someone tell me (again) the steps involved in sending a sword to Japan, having it polished, having a new habaki and shirasaya made and submitting it for papers?  I am particularly sketchy and forgetful with regard to the use of agents, how to navigate the blade through customs, making sure it gets to who it needs to get to, etc.  Also, I haven&#39;t a clue as to how much this will all cost, nor how long it takes.  Any help is appreciated.  Thank you.\n\nBest Regards,\nGary Gabelhouse\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
