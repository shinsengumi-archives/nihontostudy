One thing I would suggest is \n&gt; getting=\r\n a little smarter with your photos as the page takes a long time \n&gt; to load=\r\n. I down loaded one photo and it is 2.3 meg. Given that there are \n&gt; many i=\r\nmages there it will slow down the loading considerably and also \n&gt; eat into=\r\n peoples bandwith depending on their connection speeds.\n&gt; \n&gt; There are some=\r\n easy ways to alleviate this and if you would like to \n&gt; discuss them pleas=\r\ne just let me know. I would be happy to help you.\n&gt; \n&gt; Cheers\n&gt; \n&gt; Richard =\r\nTurner\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; On 13/09/2010 3:20 AM, lorrez_d wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Amazing work =\r\nyou&#39;re doing there !
