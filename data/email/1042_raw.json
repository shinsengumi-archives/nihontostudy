In the intro to the missing kokuho\n&gt; section list in the YNL,\n&gt; Yamanaka mentions contributing to a magazine article\n&gt; on the subject by Alan\n&gt; Schwartz.  He doesn&#39;t mention the name of the\n&gt; magazine the article was\n&gt; published in... for reasons that are now obvious\n&gt; assuming that this is the\n&gt; same article.  The date would be a rough match.\n&gt; \n&gt; Jim\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Jim and All,\n&gt; I got the magazine out last night and think it is\n&gt; interesting enough in the\n&gt; history of sword collecting to recall to other. The\n&gt; article appears in the\n&gt; SAGA, 1965, I think the August issue. The &#39;article&#39;\n&gt; is really very short\n&gt; and full of total hooey. Yamanaka is mentioned as\n&gt; the authority but not the\n&gt; author. There are about a dozen nicely mounted\n&gt; swords shown\n&gt; non-technically. These are noted as from the Ussui\n&gt; collection, but not\n&gt; described at all. Then there is the list of 14 lost\n&gt; treasures. Each of\n&gt; these gets a couple of paragraphs that list maker,\n&gt; date of recognition, and\n&gt; date/place of surrender and in most cases the name\n&gt; of the American soldier\n&gt; who received it. The source of this information is\n&gt; not explained.\n&gt; My recollection is that the list that Albert\n&gt; presented in the Newsletter\n&gt; was longer, but much less detailed in that it did\n&gt; not contain all the other\n&gt; background information. I have never seen this list\n&gt; presented anywhere\n&gt; else.\n&gt; Peter\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nProtect your identity with Yahoo!
