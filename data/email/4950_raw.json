I looked in the Haynes index (=\r\nwhich I \nnow proudly own) and found no such name. It is without a doubt \nTA=\r\nDAHIRO.\n\nI will send you pic&#39;s of another kogatana that has a mei. It looks=\r\n \nvery suspicious to me, and I have no idea what it says. I will post \nthem=\r\n into my album and send you same directly. Maybe it will be \nlegit, maybe n=\r\not. Somebody at some time has tried to fake a hamon on \nthis little blade. =\r\nI need to remove this, any ideas? I don&#39;t want to \nspend any money on this =\r\nblade unless the mei is real. Let me know \nyour thoughts. It&#39;s a learning e=\r\nxperience!\n\nThanks,\n\nElliott\n\n\n\n-- In nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Barry =\r\nThomas&quot; &lt;warlord@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; G&#39;day Elliot,\n&gt; \n&gt; Firstly the name is TA=\r\nDAHIRO, not TADASHIRO.  I am well acquainted \nwith this smith as I have had=\r\n a katana of his for many years plus \nothers of the school are well-known t=\r\no me in other collections.  And \nI have the Hizento Taikan.  And I have a b=\r\nook on kogatana.  So, \nplease post me pics direct or I&#39;m happy to look at t=\r\nhem in your \nalbum.  Higher res is better then lower res to send me direct,=\r\n as you \nmight resize them down for your album.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m presuming here tha=\r\nt you want to know if the mei is genuine??\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; Barry Thomas.\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt;   ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt;   From: Elliott \n&gt;   To: nihontostudy@=\r\nyahoogroups.com \n&gt;   Sent: Tuesday, March 27, 2007 3:16 AM\n&gt;   Subject: [ni=\r\nhontostudy] kogatana mei\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   It&#39;s me again...........\n&gt; \n&gt;   I am see=\r\nking any information about....
