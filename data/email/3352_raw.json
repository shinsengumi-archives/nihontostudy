Within a raised rim, on a panel of fine horizontal \nshakudo nanako, is a group of fruit, flowers and vegetation depicted \nin high relief.  The fruit and flowers are of gold, the leaves and \nstems of shakudo with gold drops of water.  There is a second, \nsmaller group nearter to the blade.  The reverse is of polished \nshakudo with a segment, including the butt, of gold with delicate \ndraw scratching.  The kodzuka is uninscribed.\n\nThis appears to be Goto work of a high quality, but I am completely \ninadequate for any attemt to identify the maker solely on the basis \nof the image and style.\n\nCan anybody please help.  See http://tinyurl.com/77rxt\n\nWith thanks, JPL.\n\n\n\n\n\n"
