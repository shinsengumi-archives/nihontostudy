I recently purchased a Namban \ntsub awhile in Japan that has Hozon kanteisho and is quite nice. Another \ntwist on this is that Namban tsuba are quite well thought of in Japan, \nit is the west that seems to have a lower opinion of them. Perhaps as \nthey do not come off as quite Japanese on initial study.\n\nhttp://www.nihontokanjipages.com/personal/tsuba_collection/namban.html\n\nRichard Turner\n\n\n\nDr John P Lissenden wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Dear Rick\n&gt;\n&gt; Not wishing to be &#39;picky&#39;, I tend to believe that the mistaken\n&gt; tendency to discount Namban tsuba is based upon their general poor\n&gt; quality of design and production rather than upon the fact that they\n&gt; are cast. In an attempt to salvage the reputation of this group\n&gt; perhaps, if you ask him nicely, Ron Hartman will send you an image of\n&gt; his Tokubetsu Hozon Namban tsuba?\n&gt;\n&gt; Regards, John L.\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nihontostudy@ yahoogroups. com \n&gt; &lt;mailto:nihontostudy%40yahoogroups.com&gt;, &quot;nihontochicken&quot; &lt;rick@...&gt;\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Nothing of import to add, really. I would tend to think that were\n&gt; &gt; Namban tsuba to have been in fact lost wax cast, this would help\n&gt; &gt; explain their general value discount as compared to most similar\n&gt; &gt; hand-chiseled pieces.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; NC\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; P.S. - BTW, an email to my personal account on this topic was halted\n&gt; &gt; by my mail server as &quot;spam&quot; and I don&#39;t know how to resurrect it, so\n&gt; &gt; if there was anything unique in it, please post it to this board.\n&gt; Thx.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; No virus found in this incoming message.\n&gt; Checked by AVG Free Edition.\n&gt; Version: 7.5.430 / Virus Database: 268.15.6/565 - Release Date: 12/2/2006 9:39 PM\n&gt;   \n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
