The blade actually has a deep dark colour to it. \n\nSorry for the bluish colour of the pictures, I have to do some \nalterations to my photo process. I will be adding more natural \ncolour photos this weekend. \n\nhttp://www.japaneseswordcollector.com/shige/shige.html\n\nThanks very much for looking. \n\n \nLouis Skebo\nwww.japaneseswordcollector.com\n\n\n\n\n"
