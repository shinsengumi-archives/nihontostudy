I am\n&gt; presently translating a piece by Fukushi sensei on the Higo Hirata School.\n&gt; There is only one known signed piece and probably three generations of\n&gt; Hirata Hikozo. However, in the article Fukushi sensei admits that he \n&gt; cannot\n&gt; tell the difference from one generation to the next and so lumps \n&gt; everything\n&gt; together as first generation. And, this is the easy stuff.\n&gt;\n&gt; Gordon\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
