I recently \npurchased this tsuba on eBay.\n\nSorry I don&#39;t have better pictures.  I don&#39;t have a digital camera.  These \nare the pictures I grabbed off eBay before they disappeared.  The pictures are \nin my folder &quot;Lou&#39;s Stuff.&quot;  The piece looks better in person.\n\nI like many collectors am still learning.  I was wondering if anyone out \nthere is knowledgeable enough to attribute this piece to one of the smiths of the \nAkasaka school.  It is extremely thick.  Somewhere between 9 and 9.5 mm.  I \ndon&#39;t have any calipers at home so that is the best I can do.  It is 81 X 79 mm \nin diameter.  This extreme thickness seems quite strange.  None of the Akasaka \ntsuba in Sassano&#39;s book or Kremers&#39; book are this thick.  From my limited \nknowledge I thought that earlier Akasaka pieces are very open like this one and \nare influenced by the Owari style.  I&#39;m not sure if I would say that the theme \nis Owari in style but I would say that the thickness is.  \n\nThanks to all who contribute their thoughts to this thread.\n\nLou\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
