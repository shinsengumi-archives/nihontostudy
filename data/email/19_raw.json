While hardly a scientific sample, what I did was to go\nthrough the Tokyo National Museum Uchigatana Koshirae book and record the\ntsuba diameter, saya length and tsuka length for each illustrated katana or\nwakizashi koshirae.  It&#39;s somewhat interesting to play with.\n\nIt turns out that correlation between saya length (a proxy for blade length)\nand tsuba diameter is fairly weak.  The correlation between tsuka length and\ntsuba size is actually better.  The correlation between saya length and\ntsuka length is very good.\n\nThe average katana tsuba is 8.03 cm in diameter, but the range is 5.85-10.80\ncm.\nThe average wakizashi tsuba is 6.59 cm in diameter, with a range of 4.90 to\n8.60 cm.\n\nSo, making definite statements about katana-size or wakizashi-sized tsuba on\nsize alone is pretty difficult.  There are no dates given for most of the\nkoshirae in the book, so that is not included in the spreadsheet.  There&#39;s\nmore work to do here.\n\nJim\n\n\n&gt; Jim G. actually created a database from the uchigatana book, but I&#39;m not\n&gt; sure he put the dates in so I can&#39;t xref to that.\n&gt;\n&gt; rkg\n&gt;\n&gt; Richard Turner wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;This is an interesting topic, I have just been lent The Picture Book of\nOld Tsuba by Robert Burawoy to read and enjoy and there are several of these\n&gt; &gt;very tsuba in this book. I remember reading that the tsuba size changed\nwhen fighting went from one handed mounted to two handed ground fighting.\nThere are several nice smaller cast pieces in this book that are from the\nnambokucho period. There is also a very nice red lacquer that was a used by\ncertain Priests I believe that loos spectacular. I will research this more\nlater in the day and respond with proper information.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;cheers\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Rich Turner\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;---\n&gt; &gt;Outgoing mail is certified Virus Free.\n&gt; &gt;Checked by AVG anti-virus system (http://www.grisoft.com).\n&gt; &gt;Version: 6.0.471 / Virus Database: 269 - Release Date: 10/04/2003\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; &gt;nihontostudy-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Your use of Yahoo!
