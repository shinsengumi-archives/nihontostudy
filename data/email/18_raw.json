This may or may not be correct.  I\ndon&#39;t recall seeing a pre-Muromachi period koshirae mounted with one of\nthese.\n\nThe question of tsuba size changing with time and function is a complicated\none that I don&#39;t think I have a pat answer for.  It&#39;s something I&#39;d like to\ncontinue to trade ideas on though.\n\nJim\n\n\n&gt; Jim,\n&gt;\n&gt; good idea - my delete finger was getting a little sore at certain\n&gt; members&#39; political diatribes, etc.,.\n&gt;\n&gt; There was an interesting thread started that I&#39;d guess we all can talk\n&gt; about here.  And that would\n&gt; be tsuba size.\n&gt;\n&gt; I believe Jim has seen real nambokucho koshirae (or what&#39;s left of &#39;em)\n&gt; - what size were the tsuba on these\n&gt; monsters anyway?\n&gt;\n&gt; Also, was the tsuba size a &quot;fashion&quot; thing in general, or did it really\n&gt; tend to get bigger during eras of war?\n&gt;\n&gt; Anyway, thanks for taking the initiative to try and get some serious\n&gt; conversation back into a sword list...\n&gt;\n&gt; rkg\n&gt; (Richard George)\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"
