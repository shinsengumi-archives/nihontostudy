They hold exceedingly well -- it is almost impossible to manually create any rocking motion in the &quot; centerpiece &quot;. ( Is there a real name for these centerpieces ? ) In addition, the brass is much less likely to scratch the tsuba if they should somehow come loose.\n       If anyone is interested, I could find out the correct screw size and length that would be appropriate for the typical tsuba box.\n       Regards to all,\n               Chuck Granick\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: David Zincavage \n  To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Saturday, July 19, 2003 1:38 AM\n  Subject: Re: [nihontostudy] tsuba boxes\n\n\n  Is there a source of tsuba boxes which have secure centerpieces which don&#39;t just fall off?\n\n\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n        Yahoo!
