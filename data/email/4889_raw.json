For \nexample, a gent was arrested, convicted and imprisoned for defending \nhimself in his own home using a sword against an unarmed burglar who had \nbroken into his house.  I don&#39;t know specifically if possession of a \nbladed weapon is a problem, but any aggressive or defense use likely is \na problem.\n\nBob Elder wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Is possession of a cutting sword in England illegal? I\n&gt; am going there to teach cutting seminars at 3 dojos.\n&gt; Bob Elder\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Mark,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; yeah, except that the British authorities are\n&gt; &gt; probably looking for the\n&gt; &gt; guy so he can be arrested for weapons violations...\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; rkg\n&gt; &gt; (Richard George)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Mark Jaillet wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Finally, I positive modern day story involving a\n&gt; &gt; sword.
