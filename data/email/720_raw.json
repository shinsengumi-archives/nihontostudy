The lawful use and possession of a &quot;prohibited\nweapon&quot; requires an Approval from the Chief Commissioner of Police (for\nwhich a fee is charged). Persons may be exempted from this requirement\nby the Governor-in-Council. A person, therefore, under the proposed\nRegulations, could still lawfully own and possess a sword if, for\nexample, they obtained an Approval to do so from the Chief Commissioner\nof Police.\n\nThe proposed Regulations will not necessitate destruction of swords. In\nthe event that the proposed Regulations come into operation, persons in\npossession of a sword who do not obtain an Approval from the Chief\nCommissioner of Police and who do not fall under an exemption granted by\nthe Governor-in-Council could dispose of their weapons through, for\nexample, an authorised weapons trader.\n\nThe Regulatory Impact Statement (RIS) which assesses the impact of the\nproposed Regulations has been publicly released and I attach a copy of\nthe RIS for your information. Should you wish to make a further\nsubmission on the proposed Regulations after reading the RIS (the\nproposed Regulations themselves are at Attachment 1 to the RIS) you\nwould be most welcome to do so. The closing date for submissions is\nMonday 8 September 2003. Details on how to make a submission can be\nfound in the RIS.\n\nFurther copies of the Regulatory Impact Statement can be accessed on the\ninternet at www.justice.vic.gov.au\n\nThank you for raising your views with the Department of Justice.\n\nYours sincerely\n\nSigned\n\nMarisa De Cicco\nDirector, Justice Policy\n\n\n(See attached file: Control of Weapons - Firearms Regulatory Impact\nStatement.pdf)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_________________________________________\n***CONFIDENTIAL***\nThe information in this message and in any attachments may be\nconfidential.
