Admittedly it is \ndifficult to see the hamon in his photos, but he is describing \nTobiyaki.  Also, it is interesting to see how the nakago mune is shiny \nnear the machi.  I haven&#39;t seen this before.  Would this indicate a \nrecent  machi repair, or a tight habaki that is burnishing the nakago?\n\nBob\nVerne wrote:\n\n&gt;Hello for Florida, Just joined and am fairly new to japanese sword \n&gt;collecting. I have created an album under Verne and they are pics of \n&gt;a sword I just found at an antique shop.Would like some opinons, not \n&gt;signed. Could be a shorted katana bordering on wakasashi length. The \n&gt;sword had just been brought in by a WW2 vet&#39;s widow of which he will \n&gt;give me her name to verify the story.I need help on identifying the \n&gt;hamo, it is active and on both side there are a couple of pea shaped \n&gt;temper spots floating over the main temper.\n&gt;Thanks\n&gt;Verne\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\n-- \nRobert J.
