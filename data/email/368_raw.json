I don&#39;t have much to add, other than pics \nof \n&gt;   one I own:\n&gt;   http://www.nihontophile.com/ArP1.jpg\n&gt;   http://www.nihontophile.com/ArP2.jpg\n&gt;   http://www.nihontophile.com/ArP3.jpg\n&gt;   http://www.nihontophile.com/ArP4.jpg\n&gt;   Late Koto/early Edo in late Shinshinto koshirae (with \ninteresting \n&gt;   lock)\n&gt;   Signed &quot;Shimosaka&quot;, traditionally made (visible \nhada/hamon/hataraki)\n&gt; \n&gt;   Regards,\n&gt;   Ron P.\n&gt; \n&gt;   --- In nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com, Richard Turner \n&lt;ikkanshi@w...&gt; \n&gt;   wrote:\n&gt;   &gt; Greetings all, I thought I would run this by the group since \nits \n&gt;   been a\n&gt;   &gt; bit ( read lot ) quite out there. A mate and I were talkin \nswod \n&gt;   tok the\n&gt;   &gt; other night and we were discussing tanto. He mentioned and \nsent \n&gt;   pics of\n&gt;   &gt; a very small blade that measures app 22cm in total length. As \nit \n&gt;   turns\n&gt;   &gt; out, I have one almost identical in size. Mine, as is his is \nalso \n&gt;   quite\n&gt;   &gt; thick, both about 7 or 8 mm at the munemachi, very much like a\n&gt;   &gt; yorio-doshi only far too short.\n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; Paul mentioned that he was told his was made as a gift for the \n&gt;   wife of a\n&gt;   &gt; samurai as a wedding present. He believes his to be mid/late \nedo \n&gt;   and\n&gt;   &gt; traditionally made. MIne is out of polish and hard to see hada \nor \n&gt;   hamon,\n&gt;   &gt; nie, nioi etc.. but the rest of it looks pretty similar.\n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; here is a link to the two tanto Tantos \n&gt;   &lt;www.whiz.com.au/richard/tantos.jpg&gt;\n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; I believe blades were common gifts for samurai wife&#39;s and I \nwould \n&gt;   expect\n&gt;   &gt; them to be smaller than usual but 22 cm is pretty small and \nmore \n&gt;   like a\n&gt;   &gt; child&#39;s size, though I guess weilded properly, could inflict \njust \n&gt;   as\n&gt;   &gt; much damage as a 30cm tanto.\n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; looking forward to all opinions.\n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; cheers\n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; Rich\n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;         Yahoo!
