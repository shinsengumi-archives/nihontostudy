Being a &quot;buyer&#39;s market&quot; these days, it will be interesting to see what will be put out on tables this year! Myself, I hope to sell off a few nicer items at all the shows this year -- not quite sure what just yet -- but really wish I was in the &quot;buying&quot; mode more than &quot;raising funds&quot; mode. \n\nI hope to carry down some books this year -- definitely copies of our 2006 Kokusai Tosogu Kai exhibition catalogue, priced to sell. People always enjoy books. Hope you guys and gals stop by my table and say hello!\n\nWhatever, I&#39;m sure there will be some exciting treasures begging for new ownership in Tampa. Always a well-attended show, I&#39;m sure it will be a fun weekend! \n\nRon\nSTL\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
