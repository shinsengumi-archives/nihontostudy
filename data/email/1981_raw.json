As for this kozukuka, yes, it is definitely two-piece construction.\n\nRon\nSTL\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: Jim Gilbert \n  To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Wednesday, July 07, 2004 6:03 PM\n  Subject: Re: [nihontostudy] kozuka construction\n\n\n  Hi Ron,\n  The solder joint is usually visible as a very thin line.  It can require a magnifier to see in some cases, but only the naked eye in others.  Sometimes you&#39;ll see it on the end surfaces more easily than along the edge.  It looks like the solder got out of control here.  A wide band like that is not typical.  The thin line on the left side of the photo is more like a normal joint, and even then a bit on the obvious side.\n\n  Muromachi kozuka were made from one sheet of metal folded over and closed with a single joint.\n\n  In the Momoyama period kozuka started to be made from two pieces with two joints.  \n\n  There may have been some overlap when both techniques were in use during Momoyama, but I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve seen any Edo period kozuka made in the &quot;one handed&quot; method.  (Anyone have an exception?)  Look at both the sides and the ends to be sure of how the kozuka is put together.  Sometimes it can be hard to see. \n\n  If I&#39;m reading you correctly, it sounds like your kozuka is two piece construction.  Based on the style of decoration and the application of the gold I&#39;m thinking that it&#39;s into the Edo period, but I don&#39;t have the piece in front of me.  The two piece construction does not rule out a Momoyama date.\n\n  Jim\n\n\n\n    Hi all - \n\n    Was going to direct this to Jim Gilbert, privately, but thought perhaps it would make for interesting discussion for all to read. \n\n    A kozuka here depicting &quot;tiger/bamboo&quot; has always appealed to me. Purchased in Tampa several years ago, it later went to a friend who yesterday, traded it back to me. The kozuka shows good &quot;wear/age&quot; and good shakudo color. I&#39;ve considered this &quot;ko-kinko&quot; work dating perhaps to Momoyama era, thereabout. The kozuka has been constructed by soldering (?) the face half to the back half, which is (I believe) different than most (later?) kozuka. The photos show the kozuka face and then, a close-up of this &quot;seam&quot; which can be seen quite clearly around the side of the kozuka. \n\n    My question is this. First, does this indeed look &quot;ko-kinko&quot; work? Is this type of construction indicative of ko-kinko age kozuka? What can be said about this construction (other than that perhaps the maker lacked enough skill to make this seam less obvious)? \n\n    If the link to my Yahoo photo album Ron STL does not work, contact me and I&#39;ll email the photos to you.  \n\n    http://tinyurl.com/2ccjz\n\n    Ron\n    STL\n\n\n\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n        Yahoo!
