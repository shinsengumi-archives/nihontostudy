Plus they do not appear to use\nte=\r\nchniques of traditional Japanese graphics. A side-by-side comparison of a\np=\r\nicture and a sword would be wonderful, but I&#39;d really like to see one of\nth=\r\nese pictures being made. It is almost as if they are drawn from memory\nbase=\r\nd on a deeper understanding that a single sword could convey.\nThey sure are=\r\n wonderful\nPBleed\n\n\nJim, all -\n\nI bet it would be interesting to see oshiga=\r\nta presented side-by-side of the\nvery same sword, using Nagayama&#39;s method (=\r\nwhich apparently illustrates\ndetails in a very graphic way) and the traditi=\r\nonal (realist) method.  One\nmethod &quot;draws in&quot; the detail that should be not=\r\ned while the other method\ngives a very &quot;true&quot; illustration of the hamon, le=\r\naving finding and\nunderstanding the subtle &quot;detail&quot; up to the viewer...some=\r\nthing like that,\nanyway.\n\nRon\nSTL\n  ----- Original Message -----\n  From: Ji=\r\nm Gilbert\n  To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com\n  Sent: Tuesday, July 01, 2003=\r\n 11:32 PM\n  Subject: Re: [nihontostudy] A different view...\n\n\n  Tom,\n  Any =\r\nidea of how the oshigata are actually drawn?  Looks like mottled gray\npaper=\r\n, the usual ink cake for the outline... opaque white pigment\n(gouache?) for=\r\n the hamon?  Not sure how the hada is drawn in other than by\nlots of sharp =\r\npencil work.  Interesting way of representing utsuri and\nantai.  Reality ca=\r\nn be marked on paper in many different ways.
