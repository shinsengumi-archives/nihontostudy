The nichi part is not written that way in gyosho or sosho, but the three-stroke radical I mentioned before is.  The getsu part is also not normally written that way even in sosho, but it&#39;s at least possible as a variant.  Of course the next two ji are still there to be explained.\n\nHaynes&#39; reference would be to an engraved signature rather than a shumei.\n\nIn appraisal documents there is often an &quot;ichi&quot; as in &quot;this item,&quot; but I haven&#39;t seen it in this sort of shumei.  Of course, most if not all of the shumei I&#39;ve seen on tsuba have been apocryphal, but usually to some obvious &quot;big name.&quot;\n\nSorry I&#39;m not doing better,\nJim\n\n\n  Dear Jim\n  Further to your helpful suugestions re the lacquer inscription on \n  the katchushi tsuba, is it possible that the first two kanji are \n  &#19968; (ichi) and &#32828; (mei), as illustrated in Haynes&#39; H 01715.0?  Even \n  the kao bears a (very) remote resemblance to that illustrated.\n  Regards, John L.\n        \n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
