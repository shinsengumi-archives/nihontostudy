I seen just too many of\n&gt; the exact same design in too many tsuba. I suspect most of what\n&gt; we see are &quot;school&quot; pieces and pattern book work; even for\n&gt; the major schools like Saotome, Umetada, Higo, Owari, Kyo-Shoami\n&gt; and Kyo-Sukashi, etc. \n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m not real sure just where the line is between &quot;original&quot;\n&gt; work and &quot;pattern book or school&quot; work.
