It will not however fall into your lap. There is a\nton of information on the web. I do not live in a &quot;Nihonto Knowledge Rich\nEnviroment&quot;!  My only contact for information is the web.  As far as not\nhaving a &quot;ton of money&quot;,  I once mentioned the same statement to my very\nfirst contact in the Nihonto world. His reply to me was that maybe I should\npick another hobbie!  I laugh at it now but it didn&#39;t sit well with me when\nhe first told me. It forced me to re-focus my train of thought. EDUCATE\nyourself Kim. Whatever you spend on books, you will save when you come to\nbuy your pieces.\n\nYour frustration came across load and clear! As a beginner, I could relate.\nI agree with Barry, we are all busy. Do not think that you are being\nintensionally ignored.\n\nGood luck in your quest. Enjoy the journey.......................\n\nMark\n\n\n\n\n[Mark Jaillet]\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com [mailto:nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com]On\nBehalf Of Kim Ghobrial\nSent: Friday, July 08, 2005 10:12 PM\nTo: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: Re: [nihontostudy] RE: Question....\n\n\n  Hey all,\n  I&#39;m not sure what is going on, but every time I send something or reply\n  to someone, I don&#39;t get any response from anyone.  I kind of feel like I\n  and my posts are invisible to everyone.  The other lists that I&#39;m on, I\n  get some type of response from someone, and I don&#39;t feel like I&#39;m\n  ignored.  If someone doesn&#39;t know, I would like to know this, if I need\n  to get Photos let me know, but don&#39;t ignore the questions.  There are a\n  lot of folks on this list which has expertise in parts of swords or full\n  swords and then there are folks, like myself which are learning from\n  asking questions and listening to the answers.  I don&#39;t have tons of\n  money for expensive books, what books I do have, do not cover areas\n  which I&#39;m asking questions about.  So, please, if someone asks a\n  question, please acknowledge it, even if it is an answer like, &quot;I don&#39;t\n  know the answer.&quot;\n\n  In the case of the question below, would it help in getting a photo of\n  the pieces and putting it up on this list for all of you to see?\n\n  Sincerely,\n  Kim\n\n  Kim Ghobrial wrote:\n\n  &gt;Hi Everyone,\n  &gt;Sorry to ask this, but I was looking at an Auction, which I&#39;m going to\n  &gt;see tomorrow and wanted to know if this is something for me to look at\n  &gt;or not.  Also, if it is okay, if the estimate of $120.00-180.00 is okay\n  &gt;for this piece.\n  &gt;\n  &gt;THREE JAPANESE COLLECTIBLES: two sword fittings, Fuchi-kashira\n  &gt;attributed to the Goto School having &quot;kiku&quot; and &quot;kiri&quot; motifs with gold\n  &gt;accents on black field, late Edo-early Meiji Period; together with\n  &gt;*ivory* carved ojime, inlaid, &quot;Fukuzuke&quot; (good luck) design, signed by\n  &gt;the carver, attributed to the Meiji Period.\n  &gt;\n  &gt;Kim\n  &gt;\n  &gt;\n  &gt;\n  &gt;Yahoo!
