The forging and shaping of the plate would be done with a normal hammer.  Some iron guards are indeed finished with an array of tiny pock marks like he describes.  It&#39;s more likely that this was done with a small punch that was struck with a hammer rather than directly with a pin-headed hammer.  It&#39;d be a lot easier to place and control the punch, and quicker to make and maintain the tool.  But, I wasn&#39;t there to see it done.\n\nMost Ko-Katchushi don&#39;t show this, BTW.  If they ever had it the traces have rusted away.  It&#39;s easier to find on some later work.\nJim\n\n\n  Gang I am reading Graham Gemmells book &#39;Tosogu, treasure of the samurai&#39;\n  where he discusses an early - mid Muromachi ko-katchushi tsuba and\n  mentions that a hammer nearly the size of a pin head was used to work\n  (and fold?) the steel, and thus create the textures in the iron that\n  make these things so pleasing to look at. I have some real trouble\n  imagining this being done. I presume he is talking about a hammer a bit\n  like an ice-pick with a very small surface that actually strikes the\n  metal? Why not just use a big one like the sword smith?\n\n  - Matt\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
