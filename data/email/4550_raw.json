Hence\n&gt; it is possible it was an older (but not =\r\nmuch older)\n&gt; wakizashi which had the tang reworked and a false\n&gt; signature=\r\n added. With the sword market hitting rock\n&gt; bottom during those times, it =\r\nwould have been probably\n&gt; easier and/or cheaper to rework an unsigned waki=\r\nzashi\n&gt; than go to the trouble of classically constructing\n&gt; one. Hence a f=\r\namous name was added.\n&gt;\n&gt; It is unlikely the blade merits the monetary expe=\r\nnse\n&gt; of polish, but you can learn from it. The tsuba is a\n&gt; nice little Hi=\r\ngo province type thing, and has some\n&gt; minor value to it.\n&gt;\n&gt; I live in Flo=\r\nrida and am a wee bit East Coast centric,\n&gt; so regretably I do not know any=\r\n sword clubs in\n&gt; Arizona. Several fittings collectors live out that\n&gt; way.=\r\n I believe the moderator of this list (Jim\n&gt; Gilbert) also lived in Arizona=\r\n for a while and might\n&gt; be able to direct you to local people that can tel=\r\nl\n&gt; you more about the wakizashi.\n&gt; My first Nihonto was a wakizashi very s=\r\nimilar to\n&gt; yours. I wish I&#39;d kept the menuki from it. Not\n&gt; valuable, but =\r\nvery unique. I&#39;ve never seen another\n&gt; pair like them.\n&gt;\n&gt; Welcome to Nihon=\r\nto!\n&gt;\n&gt; Curran\n&gt;\n&gt; --- bh325 &lt;bh325@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Curran,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n Thank you for your reply.
