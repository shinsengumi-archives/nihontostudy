Enjoyed seein=\r\ng lots of familiar faces and some good\n&gt; &gt; swords. People are still submitt=\r\ning stuff they shouldn&#39;t, however. I\n&gt; &gt; do hope the level of study continu=\r\nes to improve. A lot of the guys\n&gt; &gt; who have been with this for some time =\r\nnow did very well with some\n&gt; &gt; only getting one or two rejections. Nonethe=\r\nless, the younger and  \n&gt; less\n&gt; &gt; experienced guys need some guidance. I t=\r\nhink the clubs are best for\n&gt; &gt; that. Still, when the front desk tells you =\r\nnot to submit your\n&gt; &gt; numbered and stamped gunto and you do anyway, I gues=\r\ns there is not\n&gt; &gt; much that can be done. We are trying to have a traveling=\r\n shinsa  \n&gt; every\n&gt; &gt; year with Chicago up next. I hope we can continue to =\r\nsee fewer\n&gt; &gt; rejections. Oh, the show also seems to have been well attende=\r\nd on\n&gt; &gt; Saturday. I gave a short talk similar to the one in San Francisco,=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; and it was a pretty good turn out for a one off event.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Gordon\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; I was not able to make it for the show and had two swords I was  \n&gt; going=\r\n to\n&gt; submit for shinsa. One already had NBTHK attribution at Juyo level an=\r\nd\n&gt; as it was a mumei, I was interested in alternate attributions.\n&gt;\n&gt; As I=\r\n didn&#39;t make it, neither were submitted.\n&gt;\n&gt; Does the NTHK accept such blad=\r\nes? I was told somewhat vaguely that  \n&gt; they\n&gt; may not so I would like to =\r\nknow if I should bother submitting things\n&gt; like this in the future?\n&gt;\n&gt; Th=\r\nanks,\n&gt;\n&gt; - darcy\n&gt;\n&gt; -- \n&gt; NOTICE: This email is private communication for=\r\n the named recipients\n&gt; only.
