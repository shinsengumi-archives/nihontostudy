I asked Jim a similar question and as I understood\nhis reply (perhaps he will elaborate); katana tsuba\nnormally have both kozuka and kogai ana or either\nwhile wakizashi tsuba normally only have a kozuka ana.\nAlthough there are numerous exceptions; small sukashi\ntsuba which to my eye are obviously for a wakizashi\nbased on size not uncommonly have both. Also many\nof the very early tosho and katchushi tsuba had\nonly one (many had been added later). I hope I haven&#39;t\ndone too much damage to what Jim had said. I&#39;m sure\nhe will fill in the blanks.\n\nRich\n------------------------------------------------------------\n Richard Stein, PhD          alchemyst@...\n      \n             The Japanese Sword Index\n  http://www.geocities.com/alchemyst/nihonto.htm\n  http://home.earthlink.net/~steinrl/nihonto.htm\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n"
