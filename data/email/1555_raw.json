Last March I&#39;ve purchased a beautiful mumei katana with\nfantastic (really!) horimono. It came with koshirae which had damage. I&#39;ve\nhad the sword put into shirazaya and a tsunagi made for the koshirae with\nrepairs, on-going. Because the tsuka wrapping was literally falling apart,\nthe fuchi/kashira and menuki were removed and therefore, able to be examined\nin-hand. The menuki are solid gold &quot;dragons&quot; which are super! The\nfuchi/kashira (mumei) are even more fine and really do cry for shinsa with\nan eye toward Goto. The kozuka/kogai looked &quot;mainline Goto&quot; but drew\n(reportedly) a generic &quot;Goto den&quot; call from the NBTHK. \n\nMy dilemma, should these wonderful fitting be placed back on the sword or be\nkept seperately and &quot;boxed&quot; for individual preservation and appreciation. I\nsay &quot;dilemma&quot; but in all honesty my choice has been made; they will be boxed\nfor individual in-hand appreciation. So, should I feel bad to have in a\nsense &quot;destroyed&quot; a koshirae or should I feel good to have discovered these\nwonderful kodogu. Granted, the koshirae was not truly a (and I hate this\nexpression) &quot;matching&quot; koshirae and was really &quot;put together&quot; by it pre-war\nowner. Yes, I&#39;ll keep the saya and (unmounted) tsuka together with a tsunagi\nbut it seems such a waste to put these beautiful fitting back on it where\nthey can be damaged (f/k, kozuka/kogai) or hidden under ito (menuki). \n\nAfter saying all this I&#39;m not too sure where I&#39;m going with it, but my point\nmight be that there is a time to &quot;preserve&quot; a koshirae&quot; and a time to not\nworry about it. \n\nRon\nSTL\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: Gordon Robson \n  To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Monday, January 19, 2004 8:18 PM\n  Subject: RE: [nihontostudy] shinsa question\n\n\n  I think if you look at museum collections in Japan, the answer is there.\n  They do not touch anything no matter the condition. If the wrap is coming\n  off, it is coming off. They may add something to secure menuki and such to\n  keep them in place - typically thread. The same goes with lacquer, it is\nnot\n  touched. Thus, the standards for shinsa are the same. I am pretty sure\nthis\n  is the case with the NBTHK as well. So, what to do to repair something? If\n  you want to keep the piece original and unaltered, you must have all new\n  mounts made and you set aside the original pieces. I know this may seem to\n  be unreasonable, but those are the very high standards that have been\n  maintained at shinsa and in museums. I think the same holds true for\nantique\n  firearms. Re-blued barrels, re-done stocks and what not seriously harm the\n  value of the piece. Thus, such alterations should not be done lightly.\n\n\n\n  Jim, care to comment?\n\n\n\n  Gordon\n\n\n\n  -----Original Message-----\n  From: samurai@...

If you submit a tsuka, then the same will apply as\n  with\n  &gt; the NBTHK. Make sure that the tsuka has not been re-wrapped in the last\n  100\n  &gt; or so years - that means it is no longer antique and will be bounced.\n  Entire\n  &gt; koshirae will be judged based on authenticity and age of all the pieces,\n  &gt; i.e. nothing replaced, re-wrapped or re-lacquered. Also, if pieces are\n  &gt; mumei, they will not be attributed. You must submit the pieces\nseparately\n  &gt; for that. If all or some of the pieces are signed, then they will be\n  &gt; authenticated. \n\n  In the case of damaged koshirae, is this a bouncable offense, in which\n  case once something is damaged it becomes unpaperable?\n\n  - darcy\n\n\n\n    _____  \n\n  Yahoo!
