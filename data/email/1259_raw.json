Ideally cuts are \nanticipated and avoided, &quot;if there is time to block there is time to \ncut&quot; or so goes the teaching. Blocks are often hinted at in kata but \nnot emphasized. When a sword blocks another you get chips in the edge, \ncuts along the back, bends, wrinkles,you can actually &quot;shave&quot; chunks \nout of the back, cut a sword in half and the heat of impact can \nactually fuse the two together, then you are both dead...\n-t\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
