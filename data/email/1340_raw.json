Token Taikai. San Francisco: Northern \nCalifornia\n&gt; Japanese Sword Club, 1976. First edition. Transcripts of 11 lectures\n&gt; presented at the Token Taikai in San Francisco in 1976, plus three \nother\n&gt; papers not presented but included to augment the lecture topics. \nIncludes\n&gt; papers on armor, swords, sword fittings and history by noted \nauthors John\n&gt; Yumoto, Dr. Benjamin H. Hazard, Thomas Buttweiler, Dean Hartley, K. \nK.\n&gt; Chappelear, Robert Haynes and K. Torigoye.\n&gt; [This copy noted in red ink on the Introduction page as Book \nNumber &quot;27.&quot;\n&gt; Unknown how many copies were printed.] Very Good in Wraps\n&gt; \n&gt; Which I do have two copies of @ $35, not $25.
