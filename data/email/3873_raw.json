I have seen wire work like that on Kyo Shoami a few times as well, but the carving and inlay style does not look like their work.  Unsigned Bizen Shoami can be tough to tell from Kyo Shoami, so it&#39;s possible, but it looks more Bushu/Choshu to me.  \n\nSome of the original Choshu designs can be bold and the early workmanship is good.  All of the rote repetition in the later work dilutes the image of the group.  I think that one of Nakai Zensuke Tomotsune&#39;s famous guards was in a grape vine motif.\n\nFor what it&#39;s worth, I just flipped through Tsuba-Ko Bushu Ito Ha and found one example in shakudo with that sort of wire tendril work.  \n\nJim\n\n\n\n  Hi Jim, all - \n\n  I&#39;m curious about this iron tsuba which I&#39;ve placed in the photo album (Ron STL) named &quot;sworddad.&quot; Iron sukashi measuring 79.3 mm, squared edge, motif of grape leaves/grapes with vines, backside shows back of blossoms, etc. Heavy gold applied to flowers. What seems odd (I&#39;ve not seen this done before) is the use of wire to represent the &quot;feelers&quot; made intertwining with the thicker vines. \n\n  All looks pretty Choshu to me but such a bold design, I wonder about Bizen Shoami, possibly. \n\n  Opinions???\n\n  http://tinyurl.com/rlno9\n\n  Ron\n  STL\n\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  YAHOO!
