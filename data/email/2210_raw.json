It is really helping to get all this feedback.  I&#39;m \nhoping that a clear general recommended approach will \nemerge, and that I can take some confidence from this.  Your \nsuggestion about finding a $50 tsuba to work on is good.  \nIncidentally, where does one find the  substances (ivory, bone, \netc...) mentioned?  Thanks again.\n\nSteve\n\n--- In nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com, Curran Campbell &lt;\nneobliviscar@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Steve,\n&gt; \n&gt; -What he said.-\n&gt; (I concur).\n&gt; \n&gt; Read Gilbert article (on his website) on cleaning\n&gt; tsuba. If/when you first try to clean a tsuba, go\n&gt; slow. I overdid one of my first ones a bit, and have\n&gt; spent 2 years promoting healthy repatination & the\n&gt; occassional rub. On a good dense Tosho tsuba, this is\n&gt; an agonizingly slow process. Many people don&#39;t have\n&gt; the patience.\n&gt;    When doing the horn/ivory cleaning, but to practice\n&gt; with a $50 tsuba off ebay that has just a little rust.\n&gt; It will get you accustomed to the feel of doint the\n&gt; work.\n&gt; \n&gt; Curran\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; steven,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; first,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; DON&quot;T MESS WITH THE RUST INSIDE THE SUKASHI\n&gt; &gt; CUTOUTS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Now that I&#39;ve said that...\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve seen all sorts of tsuba abuse (&quot;brown&quot; wax,\n&gt; &gt; various attempts at \n&gt; &gt; repatination, people who have\n&gt; &gt; decided they can do a better job of patination than\n&gt; &gt; the original maker \n&gt; &gt; and strip top quality\n&gt; &gt; pieces down and start over, people who just wax them\n&gt; &gt; with some magic \n&gt; &gt; compound, oil them, etc.,.) - don&#39;t do it -\n&gt; &gt; basically, Jinsoo is absolutely correct - if the\n&gt; &gt; surface patina is good, \n&gt; &gt; just store &#39;em somewhere where they\n&gt; &gt; won&#39;t get condensed on and rub them periodically\n&gt; &gt; with your hands/a soft \n&gt; &gt; cloth.  If its got problems, see below...\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; the deadly enemy of iron tsuba is red rust - if your\n&gt; &gt; piece has this on \n&gt; &gt; it, its a problem.  somehow you have to\n&gt; &gt; get this off - some people use horn, but I&#39;ve found\n&gt; &gt; that ivory seems to \n&gt; &gt; be really good for use to scrape this off\n&gt; &gt; while not harming the the brown rust (I think Jim\n&gt; &gt; Gilbert has an \n&gt; &gt; excellent article on this in a couple of\n&gt; &gt; places on line...).  - often you have to work at it\n&gt; &gt; quite a bit - I \n&gt; &gt; sometimes alternate scraping sessions with\n&gt; &gt; washing the piece in warm water with a mild soap and\n&gt; &gt; a soft \n&gt; &gt; toothbrush...  And again, you only want to\n&gt; &gt; do this ONLY on the outside surfaces of the tsuba,\n&gt; &gt; not down in the sukashi.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; After you&#39;ve done that, the revealed old rust\n&gt; &gt; regions are often pretty \n&gt; &gt; gnarly, or if the piece is just plain &quot;rough&quot;,\n&gt; &gt; you can &quot;pocket polish&quot; the piece - just carry it\n&gt; &gt; around\n&gt; &gt; in your pocket for a few weeks (NOT where you carry\n&gt; &gt; your keys/change) - \n&gt; &gt; this gives the piece a nice rubbed look that\n&gt; &gt; is hard to get by just marathon rubbing sessions\n&gt; &gt; with a cloth...\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; When you&#39;re buying tsuba, always be on the lookout\n&gt; &gt; for pieces that have \n&gt; &gt; been &quot;primped&quot; like this - you&#39;ll see\n&gt; &gt; people that hide a multitude of sins with various\n&gt; &gt; waxes, oils, PAINT (I \n&gt; &gt; got a couple like this - the guy color\n&gt; &gt; matched the patina and jammed the tsuba (!!) -\n&gt; &gt; looked real darned good, \n&gt; &gt; too - I was quite happy until I tried to clean\n&gt; &gt; up a rough spot I thought was oil, used some enamel\n&gt; &gt; thinner, and - \n&gt; &gt; surprise!...), etc.,.  I&#39;d like to think they\n&gt; &gt; just wanted the pieces to look better/didn&#39;t know\n&gt; &gt; any better and really \n&gt; &gt; weren&#39;t thinking fraudulent thoughts, but....\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Good Luck,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; rkg\n&gt; &gt; (Richard George)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;Milt,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Jinsoo Kim told me that the best way to care for\n&gt; &gt; the old iron \n&gt; &gt; &gt;sukashi pieces I have is to simply rub them now and\n&gt; &gt; then with a soft \n&gt; &gt; &gt;silk cloth.  I have read the various prescriptions\n&gt; &gt; for cleaning, \n&gt; &gt; &gt;waxing, etc... and, as I&#39;ve mentioned, I am quite\n&gt; &gt; the novice and so \n&gt; &gt; &gt;am in the dark as to what the current thinking on\n&gt; &gt; this is.  The \n&gt; &gt; &gt;tsuba I have are all in excellent condition, with\n&gt; &gt; only minimal spots \n&gt; &gt; &gt;of light surface rust in some of the sukashi\n&gt; &gt; openings, and none on \n&gt; &gt; &gt;the plate or rim.  Again, I appreciate your\n&gt; &gt; thoughts on this, and am \n&gt; &gt; &gt;gradually coming to a view that if I&#39;m in doubt, do\n&gt; &gt; nothing!  \n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Thanks again,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Steve\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;Yahoo!
