Since the word &#39;namban&#39;, as adopted by the Japanese during \nthe Heian =\r\nperiod, was applied to all foreigners, irrespective of \ntheir origin, the t=\r\nerm &#39;namban iron&#39; should surely be applied to all \niron not having its orig=\r\nin in the smelting of native ore.\n\nThe importation of such iron into Japan =\r\nfrom Korea is described in \nwritings of the early part of the third century=\r\n AD, local production \noccurring only a few centuries later than this.  Nam=\r\nban iron thus \nexisted in Japan many centuries before the Dutch arrival the=\r\nre.\n\nIf, however, you consider - in my opinion, quite wrongly - that the \nt=\r\nerm &#39;namban iron&#39; refers to that of a European source, the Dutch \nstarted t=\r\no import iron, with its origins in China, Korea and India, \nin the early C1=\r\n7.  Iron and steel were both imported by the Dutch and \nthe English during =\r\nthe C17.\n\nFinally, in defining the term, does one include under the heading=\r\n \nlocally produced iron that contains a proportion of the metal from \nforei=\r\ngn sources? If so - as I believe one should - only iron produced \nlocally, =\r\nexclusively from the smelting of local ore, can be excluded \nfrom the label=\r\n of &#39;namban iron&#39;.\n\nJPL.\n\n--- In nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com, Gordon Robso=\r\nn &lt;robsongo@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi all,\n&gt; \n&gt; Well, I guess my memory is bad.

I \ndo\n&gt; &gt; not recall\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; ever seeing a first generation Yasutsugu with a Namban-tetsu\n&gt; &gt; inscri=\r\nption,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and if one exits, being dated will be extraordinary. On the \no=\r\nther\n&gt; &gt; hand, my\n&gt; &gt; &gt; memory may just be faulty. We can also go back to O=\r\nda Nobunaga \nfor\n&gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;foreign dress&quot; thing. He is said to have ha=\r\nd a Namban-gusoku \nand\n&gt; &gt; his\n&gt; &gt; &gt; standard was a Portuguese hat.

Thus he changed his nam=\r\ne to Yasutsugu \nfrom\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that point on. About the same time ( some feel i=\r\nt was a few \nyears\n&gt; &gt; &gt; later) he was given the additional privilege of ca=\r\nrving the\n&gt; &gt; Hollyhock\n&gt; &gt; &gt; crest ( Aoi mon) on his blades. These privile=\r\nges were given in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; perpetuity to Yasutsugu and his descendents. Thus t=\r\nhe Yasutsugu\n&gt; &gt; &gt; swordsmiths became the kaji of the Tokugawa Family.\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Earlier I raised the question of what made Yasutsugu&#39;s fame and\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; fortune seem to spread disproportionately to his skill when we\n&gt; &gt; &gt; com=\r\npare him to some of his contemporary smiths such as Umetada\n&gt; &gt; Myoju\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n and Horikawa Kunihiro.

Things from\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the=\r\n &quot;West&quot; were new, exciting, strange, and highly sought after.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Yasutsu=\r\ngu was one of the first advocates of using namban tetsu\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (foreign stee=\r\nl) in his swords. He proudly incised this fact on \nthe\n&gt; &gt; &gt; nakago of his =\r\nlater works. It was new, it was exciting, and \nthere\n&gt; &gt; is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; no doubt =\r\nthat this use of foreign steel helped spread his \nfameis is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; from an a=\r\nrticle on nihonto.com\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In nihontostudy@ &lt;mailto:nihontostudy=\r\n%40yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; yahoogroups.com, &quot;Alan Bale&quot; &lt;abale@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; To All,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yasutsugu 1st inscribed &#39;Nanban tetsu wo motte&#39;=\r\n on some of his\n&gt; &gt; &gt; swords, according to the Meikan his dated blades rang=\r\ne from \n1613 to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 1621\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Alan\n&gt; &gt; &gt; .\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; [Non-text=\r\n portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"
