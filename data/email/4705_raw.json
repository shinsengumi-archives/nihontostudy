This group is characterised by its \n=\r\nopenwork and undercutting; the common presence of affronted dragons \nwith t=\r\nhe tama jewel; and the atypically shaped seppa-dai.  All of \nthese are pres=\r\nent on your tsuba.\n\nI would have expected a tsuba of this type to be of iro=\r\nn, but some \nwere cast in bronze.  Interestingly these are unexpectedly att=\r\nracted \nby a magnet, but the admixture of up to 30% of iron to bronze in \no=\r\nrder to reduce the cost of the expensive alloy was not unknown.  \nAlso, iro=\r\nn was a common inclusion in naturally occurring copper ore \n\nRegards, John =\r\nL.\n\n\n\n--- In nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Patrick&quot; &lt;donuil_dhu@...&gt; wrote=\r\n:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi!

I know\n&gt; &gt; nothing of them, in fact the on=\r\nly reason I know they are called\n&gt; &gt; &#39;Tsubas&#39; is because I saw one on telev=\r\nision this morning...\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I Googled &#39;Tsuba&#39; and this group was one of =\r\nthe first links I \nfound. I\n&gt; &gt; have tried - with difficulty - to identify =\r\nand date my tsuba.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; So I thought I would seek help from people who =\r\nknow about tsubas \nand\n&gt; &gt; Japanese swords.\n&gt; &gt; Here is a link to a photogr=\r\naph of it:\n&gt; &gt; HYPERLINK\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &quot;http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v340/donu=\r\nil_dhu/_DSC0031.jpg&quot;http\n://img.p\n&gt; &gt; hotobuc-ket.com/albums/-v340/donuil_-=\r\ndhu/_DSC0031.-jpg\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I think it may be bronze.
