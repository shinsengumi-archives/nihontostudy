It was well fitted and wouldn&#39;t be noticed if not for the end of the pin visible on the back.\n\nThere are one or two old tsuba in Bob Haynes&#39; auction catalogs that are described as having the decoration pinned in place.  \n\nI can&#39;t recall ever seeing it used on a fuchi but it would be easy to miss without close inspection.\nJim  \n\n\n\n  Hi all - \n\n  Looked at a sword for a friend last evening which had something I&#39;ve never seen before. The fuchi--all that remained of the tsuka fittings--was of plain shakudo with the motif of (I&#39;m guessing) a &quot;Noh character&quot; and a &quot;closed fan in a holder.&quot; Oddly, this decoration was &quot;pinned&quot; to the fuchi rather than soldered on. Never saw that before! Actually, it was a bit loose and seemed like a careless way of attaching this to the base metal, but it was quite old and done originally and not post-war by some GI. Anyone else ever seen this method used?\n\n  Ron\n  STL\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
