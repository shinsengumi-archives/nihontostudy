This=\r\n list and a shinsa\n&gt; should be a serious opportunity for learning. I hope t=\r\nhat people can\n&gt; learn from a shinsa. I also encourage everyone to ask ques=\r\ntions.\n&gt; There were too few people who picked up their pieces and did not a=\r\nsk\n&gt; for an explanation. Next time, if there is one for you, ask the guy\n&gt; =\r\ntaking your money to call me over. I will be happy, or not, to\n&gt; explain an=\r\nything you want to know. That is why we are doing a shinsa.\n&gt; Not to make y=\r\nou feel bad, but to try and share some knowledge with\n&gt; you. If I was hard =\r\non Ted, I am sorry. If Ted would like to contact\n&gt; me off line, I would be =\r\nhappy to help him understand his results. We\n&gt; are doing another shinsa in =\r\nChicago next April.
