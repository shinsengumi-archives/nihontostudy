Just ruminating. The laminations are I think the blade equivalent of\nkizu - ware - and ideally shouldn&#39;t be there.  &quot;Bones&quot; I have no idea about\nalthough I think they are small lumps of higher carbon content = harder steel,\nso they should stand proud of the surface, like currants in a bun.  Your third\npic is difficult because it looks to me like an &quot;ordinary&quot; rusted surface where\nthe high bits are only high because of the corrosion pits leave them standing.\nDo they look like different steel???  Thus draineth my pitiful knowledge...\n\nBarry Thomas.\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: Richard Turner &lt;ikkanshi@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Saturday, April 02, 2005 10:16 AM\nSubject: [nihontostudy] Laminations and tekkotsu\n\n\nAll, I was wondering how common visible Laminations and tekkotsu were in\nolder Choshu tsuba.
