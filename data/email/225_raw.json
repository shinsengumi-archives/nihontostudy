The early warrior chronicles would support\nthis notion of one on one combat. The sohei (warrior monks) with their long\nnaginata and nagamaki might have hit a tsuba, but as these warriors were\nessentially unmounted, I think they did not typically engage with mounted\nwarriors. I know that a naginata is good for taking down a horse, but you\nhave to stand out in the open with a guy who is also armed with a bow to do\nthat, I would think. \nJoining Tom in thinking outloud.\n\nG\n----------\nFrom: tom helm &lt;junkmail@...&gt;\nTo: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: Re: [nihontostudy] unscientific kawa tsuba experiment\nDate: Sat, 10 May 2003 17:34:59 -0700\n\n\nJim et al-\n      If we accept what we are told about the warfare of the times, \nI believe a mounted warrior with a three foot tachi would be hard \npressed to cut another mans tsuba who was also mounted. Once you are \nengaging polearms and other weapons attacking from the ground or \nfighting dismounted then you may have needed a metal &quot;handguard&quot;. \nPerhaps the brief fad for nerikawa was only possible during the age \nof one to one mounted combat.\n      Thinking outloud...\n-t\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\nYahoo!
