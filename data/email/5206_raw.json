It is simply that they both involve use of wire, or is there\nsomething else going on?\nAnd, BYT, to follow up Ron&#39;s comments, both of those style seem different\nfrom those real chunky tsuba you see from time to time in which a\nplane-jane sukashi iron guard has had some wire wrapped on it. These always\nlook to me like recent junk. Am I missing something there, too?\nPeter\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
