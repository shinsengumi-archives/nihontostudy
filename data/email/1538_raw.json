If the wrap is coming\noff, it is coming off. They may add something to secure menuki and such to\nkeep them in place - typically thread. The same goes with lacquer, it is not\ntouched. Thus, the standards for shinsa are the same. I am pretty sure this\nis the case with the NBTHK as well. So, what to do to repair something? If\nyou want to keep the piece original and unaltered, you must have all new\nmounts made and you set aside the original pieces. I know this may seem to\nbe unreasonable, but those are the very high standards that have been\nmaintained at shinsa and in museums. I think the same holds true for antique\nfirearms. Re-blued barrels, re-done stocks and what not seriously harm the\nvalue of the piece. Thus, such alterations should not be done lightly.\n\n \n\nJim, care to comment?\n\n \n\nGordon\n\n \n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: samurai@...

If you submit a tsuka, then the same will apply as\nwith\n&gt; the NBTHK. Make sure that the tsuka has not been re-wrapped in the last\n100\n&gt; or so years - that means it is no longer antique and will be bounced.\nEntire\n&gt; koshirae will be judged based on authenticity and age of all the pieces,\n&gt; i.e. nothing replaced, re-wrapped or re-lacquered. Also, if pieces are\n&gt; mumei, they will not be attributed. You must submit the pieces separately\n&gt; for that. If all or some of the pieces are signed, then they will be\n&gt; authenticated. \n\nIn the case of damaged koshirae, is this a bouncable offense, in which\ncase once something is damaged it becomes unpaperable?\n\n- darcy\n\n\n\n  _____  \n\nYahoo!
