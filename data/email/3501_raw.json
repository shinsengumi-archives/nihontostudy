I&#39;ve had a good trawl and was very\ninterested to see the tsuba by Sonobe Yoshihide in the Boone Collection.  Is\nthis a Shupa (day-night) tsuba??\n\nIn the link itself as given by Andres I was particularly interested to see that\nRob Nalewajk&#39;s commentary inluded the note that shakudo was an exclusively\nJapanese alloy.  I believe this is now considered not to be so.  The quote from\nthe link is:\n\n&quot;Shakudo (literally &quot;red copper&quot;) is a metal alloy that was invented and used\nexclusively by the Japanese.&quot;\n\nI had also always believed shakudo to be an exclusively Japanese alloy, probably\nhaving read it in the same quoted sources.  A friend of mine disagreed with my\nthought and pointed me to an article, which I will briefly recap here for the\nlisteros interest (I last did this on Ichi&#39;s Nihonto list in March 1996!!).  He\ngave me a copy of the article he had read and, voila, it does seem shakudo is\nfar from being a uniquely Japanese alloy.  The article is:\n\n   &quot;Secrets of Achilles&#39; shield&quot;, by Paul Craddock, in New Scientist, 22 January\n1994, pages 32-35.\n\nPaul Craddock is head of metals research at the British Museum, London.  The\narticle gives further reading for those interested:\n\n   Metal Plating and Patination, edited by S. La Niece and P.T. Craddock\n   (Butterworth-Heinemann, 1993).\n\nOK, OK, &quot;What&#39;s it about&quot;, I hear you cry.  I hope a short quote from the\narticle will suffice:\n\n&quot;It now turns out that some of the most prestigious metals from the ancient West\nare almost identical to a sophisticated metal, known as shakudo, that is still\nmade in Japan.  The trail led from Egyptian hieroglyphics of 3500 years ago to\nclues contained in Homer&#39;s Iliad, on to the famous and highly prized Corinthian\nbronze of the Roman Empire, eastwards with more clues from the great epics of\nIndian and Tibetan literature, then to the work of barely remembered Chinese\ncraftsmen before culminating in 19th century Japan.\n\n&quot;The detective work took place at the British Museum in London, where we had\nsuspected that some of the processes briefly described by ancient alchemists for\nmaking a special type of bronze with a black patina were similar to those for\nmaking shakudo.  By a happy combination of detailed examination of metalwork,\ncareful study of ancient literature, some intuition and a little luck we were\nable to turn promising hypotheses into fact, and build up a cultural and\ntechnical trail stretching over half the globe through more than 3000 years.&quot;\n\nI found this to be fascinating reading, and I hope it is of interest to the\nlist.\n\nRegards,\n\nBarry Thomas\n(Melbourne, Australia).\n\n\n\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &quot;Andres Pedraza&quot; &lt;apedraza@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Saturday, November 19, 2005 2:29 AM\nSubject: Re: [nihontostudy] Re: Tsuba Mystery\n\n\nHere&#39;s a tsuba I personally like a lot:\nhttp://www.fieldmuseum.org/research_collections/anthropology/anthro_sites/boone/\nsword_com/sword_com26.html\n\nAs for the discussion on symbolism, do share if you ever find it.\nThere&#39;s lots of info on the net on the symbol itself, but none I&#39;ve\nseen related specifically to its use in tsuba.\n\nDewa,\n\nAndres\n\nAt 12:49 PM 11/17/2005, you wrote:\n&gt;Thanks for the info.
