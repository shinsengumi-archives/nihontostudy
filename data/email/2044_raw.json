He was a student of Ito Masakata.  He worked on shakudo plate tsuba, with all over undercut waves in the classic style and quality of the Omori school.\n\nFor reference he lists the Church collection 550 to 553.\n\nI hope this helps.\n\nJohn\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: Richard Turner \n  To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Friday, July 23, 2004 10:18 PM\n  Subject: [nihontostudy] masayoshi\n\n\n  Hi all, anyone got an idea of this guards lineage.
