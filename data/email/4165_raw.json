To \n  find a stiffer\n  &gt;   deer one would have to go to the tundra...\n  &gt; \n  &gt;   I recall well a tsuba that I found many years ago.  It was a \n  small, copper\n  &gt;   sanmai awase (if I correctly remember a phrase I haven&#39;t uttered \n  for 15 or more\n  &gt;   years!) with a touch of silver (tin??) showing stylised \n  (stamped?) waves with a\n  &gt;   creature on it that I always thought was an &quot;over-endowed \n  rabbit&quot;, but Bob\n  &gt;   Haynes told me was a fox!!  I wrote to Bob when I saw a similar \n  tsuba in one of\n  &gt;   his catalogues.  I was amazed when he said this was a very early \n  style of tsuba\n  &gt;   ca 1300 - 1400.  I had it for years, often looking at it and \n  saying &quot;Do I like\n  &gt;   it, or do I not??&quot;  Same thing with this deer kinko.  I have \n  gazed at Pete\n  &gt;   Klein&#39;s image on yahoo (I actually have the Lundren Collection \n  book, but it&#39;s\n  &gt;   out on loan to a &#39;kinko&#39; mate) for a long time on this sleepless \n  night, and I\n  &gt;   ask myself the same question all over again.  So David Z, if I \n  could ask you a\n  &gt;   question, when you say &quot;I don&#39;t collect kinko at all,  but this \n  is one of a\n  &gt;   small number of cases which, granted a opportunity, would lead me \n  to alter my\n  &gt;   policy&quot; I have to ask you &quot;WHY??&quot;  Please explain.\n  &gt; \n  &gt;   If I found this very tsuba I would think it was junk.  I don&#39;t \n  have to tell you\n  &gt;   why.  Or do I??  The design spilling into the seppadai I have \n  only seen on tsuba\n  &gt;   I didn&#39;t care for.  The wobbly surface and incredibly bad nanako \n  would kill it\n  &gt;   for me.  And the stiff deer doesn&#39;t do anything for me at all.  \n  However, I would\n  &gt;   look at the larger than usual kozuka ana and opine &quot;Hmmm, maybe \n  it&#39;s early&quot;.\n  &gt;   Back to my question to myself &quot;Do I like it, or do I not&quot;.  If I \n  don&#39;t like it,\n  &gt;   I don&#39;t collect it, no matter what the aesthetes say.\n  &gt; \n  &gt;   Now, this puts me into the rustic class, I know, but there is a \n  point to this\n  &gt;   that is not all derisory or derogatory.  It is this.  It is easy \n  to pick\n  &gt;   excellent work amongst Edo period tsuba , even in the iron &quot;wabi-\n  sabi&quot; class,\n  &gt;   but the archaic styles, the transition between (if we might say) \n  conceptual\n  &gt;   forerunners and the refined later schools is much, much more \n  difficult.  Or is\n  &gt;   it??  Recall here Milt&#39;s hawk tsuba that lead to the present \n  discussion.  And I\n  &gt;   can show you a tsuba that a well-educated (tsuba knowledge) mate \n  of mine\n  &gt;   dismissed as &quot;late, possibly 1920s&quot;.  It is a masterwork of late \n  Edo/early Meiji\n  &gt;   and belongs to a friend of mine.  If he gives permission I&#39;ll put \n  up some images\n  &gt;   of it.\n  &gt; \n  &gt;   So, to bring this to a close, are there any others inhabiting the \n  same closet as\n  &gt;   I???  I know I&#39;m lacking an ability, an aesthetic if you like, to \n  appreciate the\n  &gt;   stiff deer kinko in question and it worries me.  It seems without \n  thorough study\n  &gt;   and training many tsuba in this time frame would indeed be \n  considered junk and\n  &gt;   sold off, possibly to an ignominious fate.  The other kinko that \n  Pete shows in\n  &gt;   two images at the same link does &quot;speak to me&quot;.  It is from the \n  same time frame\n  &gt;   and I find it elegant and refined and would collect it.  I think \n  this discussion\n  &gt;   parallels the Sue Koto kazuuchimono line of thinking with blades -\n  I don&#39;t\n  &gt;   collect those either...\n  &gt; \n  &gt;   Barry Thomas\n  &gt;   (Melbourne, Australia)\n  &gt; \n  &gt;   ----- Original Message -----\n  &gt;   From: &quot;klepet33319&quot; &lt;Ppeterdds@...&gt;\n  &gt;   To: &lt;nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n  &gt;   Sent: Monday, April 17, 2006 5:50 AM\n  &gt;   Subject: [nihontostudy] Re: in defense of the ugly bird or \n  seeking more &quot;\n  &gt;   punishment &quot;\n  &gt; \n  &gt; \n  &gt;   Link to scan &#39;deer&#39; tsuba from Lundgren collection:\n  &gt; \n  &gt;   http://ph.groups.yahoo.com/group/nihontostudy/photos/view/7936?b=3\n  &gt; \n  &gt; \n  &gt;   SPONSORED LINKS Buy fine art  Japanese translation  Japanese \n  incense  \n  &gt;         Fine art inkjet paper  Fine art printing  Fine art \n  appraisal  \n  &gt; \n  &gt; \n  &gt; --------------------------------------------------------------------\n  ----------\n  &gt;   YAHOO!
