Sasano papered it years ago to one of the Akasaka generations (when a friend owned it). Later, it ended up in a Haynes auction where Bob explained it was papered Akasaka, but it is possibly Tosa Myochin. I bought the tsuba and Bob didn&#39;t send the papers. I had to ask for them and when he gave them to me (at a show) he grumbled about the call being all wrong, that they were definitely Tosa Myochin. The tsuba did have the &quot;wiskers&quot; tagane marks on the seppa-dai. Always have to laugh when I recall how upset Bob was about the Sasano call.  \n\nRon\nSTL\n\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: Jim Gilbert \n  To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Thursday, September 18, 2003 7:19 PM\n  Subject: Re: [nihontostudy] Re: Tosa Tsuba smiths\n\n\n  Rich,\n  Your piece does not have the classic Tosa Myochin-style tagane-mei, but I don&#39;t think that all pieces do.  A better photo would be helpful, but from what I can see the signature on your piece is not out of line with the one illustrated in Wakayama.\n\n  Regarding Wakayama, there are two works that are routinely referred to as &quot;Wakayama.&quot;  The first is the one I just referenced which is the three volume Toso Kodogu Meiji Taikei, published in 1978.  This is a book of photos of mei with brief information on the makers.  The Wakayama that I referred to in the previous email was his Toso Kinko Jiten, published in 1984.  This has no photos, but is a single volume of biographical information on fittings makers.\n\n  Less frequently referred to but no less valuable is Wakayama&#39;s 1972, 8 volume Toso Kodogu Koza, which is an illustrated encyclopedia of sword fittings.\n\n  Haynes is Robert Haynes&#39; The Index of Japanese Sword Fittings and Associated Artists, published in 2001.  It is similar to Toso Kinko Jiten, but expanded and in English.  It&#39;s a three volume set with no photographs, but the largest available listing of makers.\n\n  FWIW, there is a Tosa Myochi Kuniyoshi tsuba in the first Compton sale catalog with a somewhat similar motif to yours.\n\n  Jim\n\n\n\n    Hi Ron et all, ok, I did some homework and now understand the punch \n    marks you were describing, &quot;Kakushi-tagane&quot; and the image I provided \n    is not the same as these. Any thoughts if this is a gimei piece or \n    not ?, I assume if he was a lower end smith it&#39;s likely not to be \n    gimei. \n\n    Sorry to all inmy first mail, I was reading about two schools at the \n    same time and confused myself, easy for me to do. \n\n    Yes the Tosa Myochin are late Edo.\n\n    Jim, what is the Haynes/Wakayama book you are referencing ?.\n\n    Cary, do you have an image of the tsuba you had at the show or did it \n    sell ?, Just for intrests sake.\n\n    best wishes\n\n    Rich\n\n\n\n\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n        Yahoo!
