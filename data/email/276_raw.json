Bob Haynes convinced him that it was a tachi tsuba based on its similarity to the published single strand mon.  I was initially convinced that it was a katana tsuba, also based on a naturalistic reading and my bias from my experience with that fuji kozuka.  I thought that finding a matching mon would be easy given that there seems to be every variation of mon under the sun, but so far we haven&#39;t turned up an exact match.  Although that it does or does not match a published mon doesn&#39;t prove the intention of the maker or wearer.  Could it be a tachi guard... I think yes.  Is it probably a tachi guard... maybe.\n\nTom&#39;s idea of the &quot;inverted&quot; motif being viewed from above or below rather than up or down is very interesting.  The idea that a design being &quot;under the sword&quot; is inauspicious is something I hadn&#39;t encountered before.  That would still be true for katana orientation even with a front-back flip.  Maybe Tom can say some more about that. \n\nSome other thoughts... it doesn&#39;t look like it could have been mounted with o-seppa.  Of course without having a surviving tachi koshirae mounted with a Ko-Tosho tsuba, we don&#39;t know if they were mounted with o-seppa or not.  It has no hitsuana, but there are intact period katana koshirae with no kozuka or kogai.  The owner thinks that the date is mid Muromachi, which is possible given the diameter, thickness and appearance of the plate.  The design strikes me as very Momoyama, although it&#39;s possible that someone important enough to be wearing a tachi might have ordered this kind of elaborate guard much earlier.\n\nI&#39;ve been looking at the dang thing so long I&#39;m not sure which orientation looks better... I&#39;m currently leaning toward tachi, but &quot;flipped&quot; katana is tough to rule out.  \n\nSpreading the confusion...\nJim\n  Hi Jim;\n\n  The only thing remaining then is what is front and back.\n\n  The hammer marks are normally on the front but that does not mean much in this case I do not think, as its an older piece and they would use either side to tighten it to a nakago depending on how much metal is left where.\n\n  I guess we may never know.  Nice tsuba.\n\n  John\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
