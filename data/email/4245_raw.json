But of course, I have no &quot;other&quot; explanation for the &quot;male/female&quot; posts. I do find it interesting to note that the &quot;primary&quot; menuki usually has the &quot;male/solid&quot; post whereas the &quot;secondary&quot; menuki has the &quot;female/hollow&quot; post. (Primary one would be fitted to the omote/outside of the tsuka; the secondary would be on the ura side.) Make one wonder if perhaps there is some &quot;other&quot; meaning behind the use of male/female menuki posts. \n\nAs for the &quot;secret marks&quot; of Goto, I&#39;m not positive but it seems Jim Gilbert remarked about this section of the book awhile back, saying -- something like -- the idea of secret marks is not exactly true. Hope I&#39;m not saying this incorrectly, but something like that. I too, have always wondered about that section of the book in hopes of &quot;learning the key to identifying Goto works! Maybe that section just presents this idea in an overly simplified, general way?\n\nRon\nSTL\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: Barry Thomas \n  To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Saturday, May 27, 2006 8:00 AM\n  Subject: Re: [nihontostudy] Menuki Posts\n\n\n  Blokes,\n\n  The story I remember is that menuki are vestigial ornaments from pre-Heian times\n  when the tsuka was fixed to the nakago with a rivet that was not removable.  The\n  heads of the rivet were decorated and eventually became the menuki we know\n  today.  What I did not know until these emails is that some menuki have\n  &quot;interlocking pins&quot; to become mekugi.  Sure, I&#39;ve seen these on cheap Meiji\n  pieces, especially tanto, but didn&#39;t know early Goto menuki had the same\n  feature.  We can clearly see that as the Nihonto developed from earliest times\n  the disadvantage of a fixed rivet became evident, but the early menuki discussed\n  appear to have still functioned as a mekugi, only later becoming separate with a\n  bamboo mekugi, or mekugi of other material (iron??).  I also remember that in\n  the Momoyama period a single menuki was used, accounting for some of the\n  &quot;orphans&quot; we see.  Looking back over my collecting career I think I once had a\n  single (i.e., never a pair) shakudo menuki of a pomegranate.  It was of that\n  really dark black shakudo.  Sometimes knowledge comes too late to save us from\n  ourselves!!!\n\n  Ken, I do have somewhere a late 19th century English treatise on the Goto\n  mainline (Shirobei 17 generations) with photos, but it doesn&#39;t go into the\n  &quot;secret marks&quot;...  Does anyone know the title of the Japanese one that Ken\n  mentions??\n\n  Regards,\n\n  Barry Thomas.\n\n  ----- Original Message -----\n  From: &quot;Kenneth Wilson&quot; &lt;kdw21620@...&gt;\n  To: &lt;nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n  Sent: Sunday, May 28, 2006 12:34 AM\n  Subject: Re: [nihontostudy] Menuki Posts\n\n\n  Yes, I believe that at one point the menuki where\n  &quot;interlocking&quot; with each other, at least on some\n  styles of sword mounting design.  I can&#39;t remember\n  what I had read about it, but I think this was the\n  combo of the mekugi-ana and the menuki, but overtime\n  the menuki and peg seperated and served different\n  roles.  ok I took a stab at it, now someone can\n  correct what I said.  Would love an english\n  translation  of the 17 generations of goto (can&#39;t\n  remember japanese tittle) in which all the secret\n  marks are revealed.\n  Ken\n\n  --- klepet33319 &lt;Ppeterdds@...&gt; wrote:\n\n  &gt; Hello all.

Does anyone know the\n  &gt; reason for this?
