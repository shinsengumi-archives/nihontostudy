Yumoto&#39;s is a magnificent pocket reference, \nalthough a bit dated. The Connoisseur&#39;s is a much more detailed \nreference, covering the same ground as Yumoto&#39;s, but with more \nexamples of every feature a nihonto can have. Curiously enough, every \nnow and then I see it being offered on eBay, sometimes reaching bid \namounts above 100 dollars. For the life of me, I can&#39;t understand \nwhy. Not that the book isn&#39;t worth it, but because it&#39;s still \navailable off the shelf at Amazon for less than 50 bucks: \nhttp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?path=ASIN/4770020716&link_code=as2&camp=1789&tag=lairofthenecr-20&creative=9325\n\nNow, that being said, the Connoisseur&#39;s is probably the best \nreference available in English. It pales in comparison to published \nin Japan nihonto reference books which can make the Connoisseur&#39;s \nlook like the pocket reference version.\n\nLastly, another book I found to be a good read, especially as it \ncovers nihonto manufacture, is The Craft of the Japanese Sword, by \nLeon Kapp, also available from Amazon: \nhttp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?path=ASIN/087011798X&link_code=as2&camp=1789&tag=lairofthenecr-20&creative=9325\n\nHope that helps.\n\nRegards,\n\nAndres\n\nAt 08:39 AM 8/4/2005, you wrote:\n&gt;Guess you&#39;re missing Andres point here.

Any\n&gt;sugestions out there for a must have &quot;second&quot; reference book? Just keeping\n&gt;things basic at this point.
