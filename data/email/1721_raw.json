The kashira is \nlost and has been replaced with a polished horn one. The menuki are \nmatching good quality shakudo with gilding, catfish and plants \ndesign.\n\nThe blade has been cut down by several inches, so unfortunately any \nsignature it once had is gone.\nA few people I have showed the sword to have commented on the \nunusual saya bevel.\n\nI was told by a dealer that from the style of the sword it wouldn&#39;t \nhave been part of a daisho. Interestingly enough it also appears to \nhave battle damage on the back of the mune.\n\nThanks,\n\nPeter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Jim Gilbert&quot; &lt;jggilbert@E...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; Peter,\n&gt; The original metal fittings appear to be a set by one maker or at \nleast a single workshop.  I think that they could be work from \nShonai in northern Honshu.  Is the fuchi or tsuba signed?  The \nkozuka is a later substitution of lower quality.  I can&#39;t really see \nthe menuki in the photos.  The kashira appears to be of a different \nmaterial.  I&#39;m guessing that it may have been lost and that the \ntsuka has been rewrapped, but I can&#39;t see much in the photos.\n&gt; \n&gt; The bevel on the saya would be up against the body when the sword \nwas worn so it&#39;s probably not just for show.  My guess is that it \nmight be more comfortable to wear or would help position it somehow \n(?).  It&#39;s an unusual feature.  Does anyone know what it&#39;s called or \nwhat it is really for?\n&gt; \n&gt; As a lone wakizashi it could have been worn by a non-samurai, but \nI don&#39;t see anything about the koshirae that would make that \nnecessarily so.  \n&gt; \n&gt; Jim\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   Hi,\n&gt; \n&gt;   Can anyone assist me with this Wakizashi? I&#39;m after more \ninformation on the\n&gt;   style and school of the mounts. I was told that due to the style \nof the\n&gt;   mounts it would have been a merchants or high class civilian&#39;s \nsword. Can\n&gt;   anyone confirm or deny this?\n&gt;   The grove cut into the saya does look to be a kind of fashion \nstatement. The\n&gt;   blade is out of polish but looks to have a gunome hamon.\n&gt; \n&gt;   http://www.c.farrar.btinternet.co.uk/wak/\n&gt; \n&gt;   Thanks for any assistance anyone can offer!\n&gt; \n&gt;   Peter\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
