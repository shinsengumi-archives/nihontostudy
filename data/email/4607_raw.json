Bob Elder \nstill trying to figure it all out...\n--- excelsiorilluminati &lt;excelsiorilluminati@...&gt;\nwrote:\n\n&gt; Hi Guys, I just followed this thread on both Yahoo\n&gt; forums and found \n&gt; it interesting and humourous. There was a lot of\n&gt; testing done at the \n&gt; execution grounds and it seems probable that a sword\n&gt; of particularly \n&gt; heavy weight and special construction would be used\n&gt; to test ones \n&gt; abilities in a one handed stroke. I would hate to be\n&gt; the prisoner, \n&gt; as, the one handed grip has a tendency to turn in\n&gt; the cut. Most \n&gt; executions being done by low ranking bushi. I do not\n&gt; think that it \n&gt; would be used because of the rain though. There\n&gt; would be plenty of \n&gt; attendants to assist with the restraints, guarding,\n&gt; official \n&gt; recorders and their attendants that someone could\n&gt; hold an umbrella or \n&gt; construct cover. The thought of the executioner\n&gt; calling &quot;Bring the \n&gt; special umbrella holding one handed in the rain\n&gt; sword&quot; is what \n&gt; brought a smile to my face.
