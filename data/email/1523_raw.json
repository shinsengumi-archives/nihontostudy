Continuing the subject of Kanayama tsuba, would you say that\nthe &#39;quite large seppa dai in proportion to the rest of the guard&#39;\nfeature on this type of tsuba is a kantei point? For some reason they\nall seem to have a larger seppa dai in relation to the rest of the\ndesign than most other tsuba. \n \nOther kantei points would be the type of steel, the color, the tekkotsu,\nthe designs used (often hard to figure out what they represent) etc. \n \nAm I missing any here?\n \nI seem to be getting the knack of distinguishing what is what with all\nthese different tsuba :- / but that is only because I have spent ages\nand ages looking at all kinds of stuff and remembering what such and\nsuch looked like an what school it was. Now I am trying to pinpoint\nspecific features to help attribute guards more correctly and date them.\nMuch like you would do with porcleain with decorative motives and the\npaste of the porcelain. \n \nMatt.  \n \n \n\n\n    Z Recruiting Services\n    &quot;Zurich Toren&quot; Muzenstraat 89\n    2511 WB Den Haag\n    T: +31 70 4262273\n    F: +31 70 4262111\n    W: zrecruiting.com\n    E: info@...\n    Kijk ook op monsterboard.nl, jobbingmall.nl en \n    nationalevacaturebank.nl voor actuele vacatures!\n\n\n-----Oorspronkelijk bericht-----\nVan: Jim Gilbert [mailto:jggilbert@...] \nVerzonden: maandag 19 januari 2004 21:37\nAan: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com\nOnderwerp: Re: [nihontostudy] Kanayama tsuba?\n\n\nMatt,\nThe short answer is that I don&#39;t know.  \n\nBut, I tend to doubt it.  The Norisuke working in the 19th C produced\ntekkotsu at will and in their copies sometimes exaggerated them beyond\nwhat was in the originals.  Good Kanayama work is still more attractive,\nbut how much of that is because of raw material vs. technique vs.\nintent?\n\nIt&#39;s quite possible that Kanayama guards simply went out of style.  The\naesthetic trend in the Edo period moved away from the tastes of the\nMuromachi and Momoyama in paintings, ceramics, etc., as well as sword\nfittings. \nJim\n\n\n\n  Gang, how much truth is there to the theory that the Kanayama tsuba\n  makers used a &#39;special secret iron ore known only the them and\nprobably\n  close to where they worked&#39; that produced the wonderful tekkotsu\neffects\n  in their tsuba? And that when the when they ran out of this particular\n  iron ore the school ceased to exist?\n\n  Matt\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n  _____  \n\nYahoo!
