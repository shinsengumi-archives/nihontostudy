So I scrounged up an old nikon 50mm lens\n(you can get these dirt cheep) and tried that reversed on my 50mm lens. \n the result\nwas this:\n\nhttp://home.teleport.com/~rkg/misc/gumby2.jpg\n\nThis suuucks - you can see the vignetting/blockage  around the edges :-(\n\nBefore just putting the piece up on ebay, I decided to try it reversed \non a 105mm macro.\n(and here&#39;s the obligatory nihonto related content) - this is a picture \nof an iris on a kashira\nthat I have - note that I didn&#39;t take much time in the setup (used a \nlamp for lighting and\nwagged the white balance) and the camera is at a complex and incorrect \nangle\nrelative to the surface (so not a lot of its in focus), but...\n\nhttp://home.teleport.com/~rkg/misc/extreme_deux.jpg\n\nYou can see it just starting to vignette in the very corners, but a \nlittle crop, and...\n\nNot as flexible as a mp-e 65, but it doesn&#39;t cost $800 either....\n\nJust had to share...\n\nrkg\n(Richard George)\n\n\n\n"
