Mr.=\r\n Tanobe told us in October that all of this has been resolved and things ar=\r\ne moving ahead once again. I&#39;ve no clue if this has delayed shinsa results =\r\nalthough I suspect it has. Early in last year several swords sent over did =\r\ntake a longer than usual time to clear shinsa. At that time, according to w=\r\nhat Tanobe san told me, they were simply hit with an unusually large number=\r\n of shinsa submissions. I suspect it has been a combination of such things =\r\nthat my have slowed things down a bit. Hopefully 2007 will see things back =\r\ninto a more normal mode for them. \n\nRon\nSTL\n  ----- Original Message ----- =\r\n\n  From: Richard Turner \n  To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Monday=\r\n, January 15, 2007 3:37 PM\n  Subject: Re: [nihontostudy] NBTHK October Shin=\r\nsa\n\n\n  I just hear they had 1000 swords in backlog, I don&#39;t know if this is=\r\n \n  right or not, just what I heard.\n\n  Rich\n\n  Curran Campbell wrote:\n  &gt;\n=\r\n  &gt; List,\n  &gt;\n  &gt; I&#39;ve heard the NBTHK had a considerable number of\n  &gt; swo=\r\nrd and fittings submittals, and was running behind\n  &gt; on the considerable =\r\nworkload.\n  &gt; I&#39;m sure the holidays didn&#39;t help either.\n  &gt;\n  &gt; Anyone able=\r\n to confirm this?
