This is the one I am\nreferring to in the response as Aizu Shoami which\nexactly matches my smaller one pictured (which bye the\nway isn&#39;t small at all).  \n\nhttp://www.finesword.co.jp/sale/k081.htm\n\nThe other one pictured on yahoo japan does look more\nlike my larger one sans the shakudo mimi and plugs\nwhich all agree is Mito.  It is this one above and its\nbrother in my possesion that Jim G said was possibley\nMito Shoami, but the gentleman at finesword said was\nAizu Shoami.  I&#39;m hoping that I can get the yahoo\njapan one cheaply with our cowboy&#39;s help.  It is kind\nof a cross between the 2.  While it does look like\nthey are done by the same hand, it is still possible\nthat the Aizu were copying the Mito?  Aren&#39;t they near\neach other location wise ie Northern Japan?  Kind of\nfunny how these all appeared and got me salivating. \n\nThanks.\nKen\n\n\n\n\n--- alchemyst &lt;alchemyst@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Ken -\n&gt; \n&gt; IMHO, no doubt yours and the Japanese auction one\n&gt; are Mito.\n&gt; The tagane-mei are very characteristic of Mito work.\n&gt; The\n&gt; pattern on your small tsuba, the Japanese one and\n&gt; two on\n&gt; my tsuba page (top center, top right)\n&gt; \n&gt;\nhttp://www.geocities.com/alchemyst/tsuba/tsubapic.htm\n&gt; \n&gt; are the same.
