To \nclarify, I have a certain feeling that I should see or at least \nexpect to see Hizen blades in Higo koshirae. They seen to fit for \nsome reason unbeknownst to me. \nSo is there a school of koshirae that is more suited to say Yamashiro \nblades, or swords of the Echizen province and things like that or is \nit more just the taste of the owner. \n\nI was thinking that a sword from say Iwami province probably wouldn&#39;t \nhave Edo koshirae or Higo for that matter as they would be to far \naway and the owner would select a local or more local artisan unless \nthey traveled or were of a higher stature and had no budget \nconstraints. \n\nany thoughts on this ?? \n\ncheers \n\nRich\n\n\n\n"
