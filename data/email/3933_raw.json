Perhaps each of\n&gt; those among us who collect and study tsuba might\n&gt; take the time to write a few paragraphs identifying\n&gt; the particular merits of, and reasons for\n&gt; collecting, a particular school.  The really\n&gt; outspoken might go farther and identify a school, or\n&gt; type, of tsuba they do not collect, and explain why.\n&gt; \n&gt; DZ     \n&gt;   ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt;   From: klepet33319 \n&gt;   To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n&gt;   Sent: Sunday, March 12, 2006 3:42 PM\n&gt;   Subject: [nihontostudy] Kantei\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   I for one have enjoyed Jim&#39;s kantei(s).  I am\n&gt; wondering if the other \n&gt;   members concur and if they might like something\n&gt; like a regular kantei, \n&gt;   possibly Friday with answer on Sunday?  Or\n&gt; bi-weekly? Perhaps we could \n&gt;   generate a list of those interested in submitting\n&gt; their treasures with \n&gt;   one member being chosen by Jim each week.  Then\n&gt; that party could post a \n&gt;   picture with Jim giving his ideas at the close of\n&gt; the bidding.  That \n&gt;   way he&#39;d be on the hot-seat as well (although I\n&gt; think luke warm in his \n&gt;   case at best LOL).
