The one from Bunei is said to be  \nin the line of Miike Denta and it suggests more info on this smith  \nmay be found in the Kokon Kenko Meizukushi and the Kokon Kaji Mei  \nShuroku. The other is an Oei era smith working in Chikugo but only a  \nniji-mei is given in the listing, more info on this smith is said to  \nbe found in the Kokon Ruiji Meizukushi and the Meizukushi Hiden Sho.  \nSeveral of the Sadahide are working in Hirado, Fukunaga points out  \nthat these are considered to be smiths from the Sa school but at  \nleast one theory has it that they originated from Miike...\n-t\nPS the references mentioned are all old rare books none of which are  \nin my meagre library.\nOn Dec 8, 2006, at 10:07 PM, Doug Blain wrote:\n\n&gt; I have gone through all my books and online resources looking for more\n&gt; information on a smith of the Chikugo Miike school, Sada Hide. The  \n&gt; only\n&gt; reference I have found is from the Sho-Shin website where the smith is\n&gt; listed as Sada Hide Bun-Ei 1264. He is not listed in Hawley, Koto\n&gt; Nihonto Zuikan, JSS cross-index or Yamanka&#39;s newsletters. I have a  \n&gt; well\n&gt; worn wakishasi of his with all the typical Miike characteristics (wide\n&gt; hi, narrow suguha, etc.) and have been trying to find out any\n&gt; additional information on this particular smith. The signature on the\n&gt; blade is Miike ju Sada Hide (very faint). Hopefully there are some\n&gt; better libraries out there...\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
