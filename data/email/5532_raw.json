If\n&gt; you see no grain in the hada it is certainly an indication it is\n&gt; machine made, if the polish is good enough to tell. The hamon of a\n&gt; machine made blade when oil quenched shows lack of activity, a clue.\n&gt; Focus your pics on the nakago and mei for appraisal. Fred knows his\n&gt; stuff so he is probably right. John\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com, &quot;D.

Is this\n&gt; &gt; as I hope the original edge?\n&gt; &gt; * could the saya be an old one since it&#39;s lacquered?\n&gt; &gt; * since the grip still has the sharkskin, safe to assume it&#39;s late\n&gt; but not VERY late war\n&gt; &gt; (when fishskin was abandoned)?\n&gt; &gt; * the field cover seems to have shrunk over the saya. I&#39;d like to\n&gt; see the scabbard in its\n&gt; &gt; glory. but - best leave alone?\n&gt; &gt; * are the stamps in the saya cover more likely inspectors&#39; or\n&gt; owner&#39;s?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; many thanks for the patience and help with these queries!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ll try to load a few pix....\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n\nDavid Walsh\npixwords@...\n301 657 8994\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
