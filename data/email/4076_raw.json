While reading up on Yagyu tsuba in \nthe &#39;Selected =\r\nFine Japanese Swords from European NBTHK Collections&#39; I \nran across an inte=\r\nresting reference to Yagyu Yoshikane Renya (1625-\n94) who is the founder of=\r\n the Yagyu style of sword guards.  \nApparently after retiring from being th=\r\ne fourth master of the school \nhe set about the design of tsuba, having the=\r\nm crafted by many leading \nOwari tsubako of the day.  His workshop was loca=\r\nted in the village of \nKobayashi, south of Nagoya Castle, and he took the p=\r\nriest name of \nKobayashi Osho.  Now anyone who is into Star Trek knows of t=\r\nhe famous \nKobayashi Maru Scenerio, which is a test of an officer candidate=\r\ns \ncharacter in the face of certain defeat/death.  &#39;No killing, no gain, \nn=\r\no win, no lose -- the sword of Shinkage Ryu is not the sword style \nof outs=\r\nide but the style of inside -- no formal style is our style&#39;;  \nYagyu Jubei=\r\n Mitsuyoshi from his &quot;Tsuki no sho&quot;.  \n&#39;Admiral Kirk, who had been monitori=\r\nng the situation from the control \nroom decides to stop the simulation. The=\r\n main viewscreen slides aside \nas he walks into the room. Saavik asks for s=\r\nuggestions, to which Kirk \nreplies that she should pray as the Klingons don=\r\n&#39;t take prisoners. \nAll the &quot;deceased&quot; officers begin to rise, the blowers =\r\nbegin blowing \nthe smoke in the simulator room clear, and the trainees are =\r\nordered \nto report for debriefing. Saavik remains and protests that the tes=\r\nt \nwas unfair as there was no way to win. Kirk tells her that how a \nperson=\r\n faced death was as important as how they faced life&#39;;  from:\n\nStar Trek II=\r\n -- The Wrath of Khan \nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobayashi_Maru\n\nLOL -- =\r\nI wonder if Gene Rodenberry was into Nihonto?\n\n\n\n\n"
