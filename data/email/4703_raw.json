Can you put up a better pic that is better exposed to show more of the detail in the work, and preferably both sides of the tsuba.\n\nRegards,\n\nBarry Thomas.\n\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: Patrick \n  To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Wednesday, December 06, 2006 11:41 PM\n  Subject: [nihontostudy] Tsuba help\n\n\n  Hello,\n\n  I was hoping to get some help regarding a &#39;Tsuba&#39; I have. I know\n  nothing of them, in fact the only reason I know they are called\n  &#39;Tsubas&#39; is because I saw one on television this morning...\n\n  I Googled &#39;Tsuba&#39; and this group was one of the first links I found. I\n  have tried - with difficulty - to identify and date my tsuba.\n\n  So I thought I would seek help from people who know about tsubas and\n  Japanese swords.\n  Here is a link to a photograph of it:\n  http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v340/donuil_dhu/_DSC0031.jpg\n\n  I think it may be bronze. And help I could get with identifying and\n  dating it would be briliant! Thanks in advance!\n\n  Patrick\n\n  . \n   \n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
