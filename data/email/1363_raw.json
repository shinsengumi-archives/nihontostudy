For real, high quality Mino (or Goto) \ntsuba the color of the shakudo is pure black without a trace of \nbrown.  The carving is very crisp and precise, the nanako perfectly \nformed and the gold thick with rich color.  Putting a good one next \nto a lesser one makes the difference much more clear than I can hope \nto describe.  I borrowed two tsuba to do that at the SF show with a \nfew people when we were talking about exactly this topic.\n&gt; \n&gt; Seeing this one in person would help of course, but I think it \nfalls short.  The somewhat sloppy carving of the insects and plants \nlooks like shiiremono work.  I agree that it is much better than the \nworst of the so-called Nagoya-mono.  That said, I have seen a few \npieces of this type that I didn&#39;t think were too hot, but got Hozon \nlevel attribution to later Mino.  I suppose that there is overlap \nbetween the better Mino-style production work and lesser &quot;genuine&quot; \nMino.  There is a chance that Milt&#39;s piece could paper as later Mino \n(even without free drinks) if it&#39;s better than the photo suggests.  I \ndon&#39;t think that it is representative of high quality Mino work \nthough.\n&gt; \n&gt; Does that make any sense?\n&gt; \n&gt; Jim\n&gt; \n&gt;\nplease klick.........\n\nhttp://tinyurl.com/365t5\n\ngoto-mino ?\nvery &quot; deep &quot; carving................\n\nmilt\n\n\n"
