Not all Nobuiye tsuba if not &quot;the&quot; Nobuiye should be \ndisgarded to quickly.\n\nRich\n\nJim Gilbert wrote:\n\n&gt; Matt,\n&gt; I haven&#39;t seen the guard in person, but here&#39;s something I wrote in \n&gt; response to an off line question a couple of weeks ago.\n&gt;\n&gt; Jim\n&gt;   There were a number of makers working\n&gt;   in the Edo period that signed Nobuie, often including their place of\n&gt;   residence.  There are guards signed Kaga, Owari, Echizen, Akasaka, etc.\n&gt;   Nobuie.  Sometimes the work style of a particular later guard with \n&gt; only a\n&gt;   two-character signature can be tied back to one of these.  I don&#39;t think\n&gt;   that I have ever seen a formal kanteisho written attributing a\n&gt;   two-character-signed guard to a specific regional Edo period maker, \n&gt; though.\n&gt;   I have seen an NBTHK kanteisho written to &quot;Nobuie (Edo period)&quot; to \n&gt; show that\n&gt;   it is not a forgery, but is one of the later makers.  I have seen \n&gt; another\n&gt;   written to &quot;betsujin Nobuie,&quot; meaning a different person, i.e., not the\n&gt;   famous maker(s).  I have also seen good quality, early Edo period tsuba\n&gt;   signed Nobuie fail shinsa as forgeries.\n&gt;\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
