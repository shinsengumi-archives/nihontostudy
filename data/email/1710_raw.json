But I&#39;ll try and further discussion on it.\n&gt; Those with more knowledge ___PLEASE___correct me.\n&gt; \n&gt; Very -off the cuff- impression is it was later\n&gt; Shinto\n&gt; or Shinshinto shortened to fit WW II mounts. Little\n&gt; guess as to school. I have much to learn about\n&gt; ShinShinto.\n&gt;   I don&#39;t know much either about WWII mounts, so not\n&gt; sure how much that would trim. Would move the machi\n&gt; up\n&gt; considerably and leave a bright nakago mune behind?\n&gt; Does seem to my eye to have tobiyaki, so I thought\n&gt; that was a good sign.\n&gt;    I wondered about the geometry on the kissaki and\n&gt; would like to see the sugata/shape of the whole\n&gt; sword.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Curran\n&gt; \n&gt; --- Robert Gilmore &lt;rgilmore82@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Does anyone have any comments on Verne&#39;s sword? \n&gt; &gt; Admittedly it is \n&gt; &gt; difficult to see the hamon in his photos, but he\n&gt; is\n&gt; &gt; describing \n&gt; &gt; Tobiyaki.  Also, it is interesting to see how the\n&gt; &gt; nakago mune is shiny \n&gt; &gt; near the machi.  I haven&#39;t seen this before. \n&gt; Would\n&gt; &gt; this indicate a \n&gt; &gt; recent  machi repair, or a tight habaki that is\n&gt; &gt; burnishing the nakago?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Bob\n&gt; &gt; Verne wrote:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;Hello for Florida, Just joined and am fairly new\n&gt; to\n&gt; &gt; japanese sword \n&gt; &gt; &gt;collecting. I have created an album under Verne\n&gt; and\n&gt; &gt; they are pics of \n&gt; &gt; &gt;a sword I just found at an antique shop.Would\n&gt; like\n&gt; &gt; some opinons, not \n&gt; &gt; &gt;signed. Could be a shorted katana bordering on\n&gt; &gt; wakasashi length. The \n&gt; &gt; &gt;sword had just been brought in by a WW2 vet&#39;s\n&gt; widow\n&gt; &gt; of which he will \n&gt; &gt; &gt;give me her name to verify the story.I need help\n&gt; on\n&gt; &gt; identifying the \n&gt; &gt; &gt;hamo, it is active and on both side there are a\n&gt; &gt; couple of pea shaped \n&gt; &gt; &gt;temper spots floating over the main temper.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Thanks\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Verne\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; -- \n&gt; &gt; Robert J.
