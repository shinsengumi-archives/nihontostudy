That style with the cupped shape and nunome\nzogon is often labeled Hizen.  I don&#39;t recall seeing one made with two-layer\nconstruction like that, though.  Does the other plate just cover the flat\narea, or does it follow the cup all of the way to the rim?\n\n  Jim\n\n\n\n    greetings all, I lifted this of my message board,\n    http://pictures.care2.com/view/1/743171541 the owner is stumped and so\n    are the rest of us I think. This concerns images 1 & 2.  Notice in the\n    tight shot of the nagako ana, three is obviously 2 plate of metal, I\n    thought I was looking at leather or something at first but it is\n    obviously iron. What would be the purpose of the, is it common/rare, he\n    was wondering if there is a known style/school/era for this piece.\n\n    cheers\n\n    Rich\n\n\n    [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n          Yahoo!
