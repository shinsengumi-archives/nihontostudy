The few times I&#39;ve looked at these stamps they really didn&#39;t look like they were &quot;cold stamped.&quot; They don&#39;t appear &quot;sharply&quot; cut nor do they appear &quot;pushed out&quot; around their edges (so to speak). But I can&#39;t understand how you could &quot;hot stamp&quot; a nakago. It would seem the nakago would have to be at a &quot;red&quot; temperature for hot stamping, and that would seem to need to be done before the hamon treatment is done. These stamps seem to be nicely done and in keeping with the rest of a &quot;finished&quot; nakago, not done way ahead of finishing the nakago. Honestly, I have no knowledge of how this is done, other than what has been passed on over the decades. It would be interesting to hear from somebody (swordsmith?) who has first-hand experience on this. Let&#39;s see what others can offer...\n\nRon\nSTL\n\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: Matthew E.

I&#39;ve always\n  refered to these as &quot;hot stamped&quot; but really, I wonder how the smith applied\n  these stamps. The nakago being soft (not hardened), were they punched in\n  after the sword was finished? It would seem illogical to think the smith\n  &quot;heated the nakago&quot; enough to &quot;hot stamp&quot; their seal. Can anyone explain how\n  this was done?\n  &gt;\n  &gt; A related question is about Masahide who did apply a &quot;kokuin&quot; to his\n  nakago. Does anyone know if Masahide ever signed his nakago with his\n  &quot;kokuin&quot; only? (Not signing his full mei with it.)\n  &gt;\n  &gt; Ron\n  &gt; STL\n  &gt;\n  &gt;\n  &gt;\n  &gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n  &gt;\n  &gt;\n  &gt;\n  &gt;\n  &gt;\n  &gt; Yahoo!
