I thank \n&gt; those that took a look.  Well, a friend translated it to read Yama-shiro Kuni \n&gt; Fushi-mi ju Kan-ie&#39;.  So what I have to ask is this the real thing?  \n\nHey, it would go nicely with the two that I have!\n\nI put one on the Sadamune, and the other on the Masamune.  :-).\n\n- darcy\n\n(OK, kidding aside, the scoop is that you&#39;re probably not going to find\nan authentic one signed like this... there was a group in Saga who\nsigned like this claiming lineage to Kaneie, but I gather everyone\nthought they were rather full of it for doing so. They signed in the\nsame manner, though they were in Hizen. These exist I think in a void\nbetween gimei and the real deal. Maybe it&#39;s like some dude downtown\nclaiming Picasso was his great-great grandfather, so choosing to paint\n&quot;picasso&quot; style and signing &quot;picasso.&quot; While those are not technically\nforgeries, they&#39;re also not the real thing, but they are those dude&#39;s\npaintings. I have one of the Saga group pieces (as do probably many\npeople), and I also have one that would seem to be an homage piece, not\nsigned Kaneie but signed Yamashiro Kuni ... Masa[X] which is not quite\nlegible... I am sending it to Cary for research.... disclaimer: I know\nless about tsuba than I do about swords, correction is gladly taken as\nlearning information, I am passing on what I have read/listened to\nintently, if there are errors in that it is because I have inserted\nthem out of ignorance.)\n\n\n"
