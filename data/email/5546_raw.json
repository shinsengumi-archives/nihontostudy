One is a copy of his \nbook =\r\nsigned with a inscription \n&gt; when he gave it to Dr Compton - very cool, but=\r\n not much information \ncontent, just a \n&gt; reference to happy sword collecti=\r\nng.   The other is a letter from \nRobinson (who had amazing \n&gt; penmanship) =\r\nto the owner of a sword that I now own describing at \nlength who made the \n=\r\n&gt; sword, where it was made etc.   Let me know if this would be of any \ninte=\r\nrest.   Cheers, Bob.  -\n&gt; -- In nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com, &quot;excelsiorill=\r\numinati&quot; \n&lt;excelsiorilluminati@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; A fellow I know and his kan=\r\ntei group have come upon some \ncorrespondence \n&gt; &gt; between Messrs.
