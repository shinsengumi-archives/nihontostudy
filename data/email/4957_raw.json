How else are y=\r\nou going \nto learn. Of course, you must look at bad and good. Then you \nund=\r\nerstand the difference. \n\nI should not have brought up the temper - it&#39;s a =\r\nlousy job of a fake \ntemper. Whoever applied the fake temper should be shot=\r\n! I refuse to \nleave it alone, I must have it removed. You can see the scra=\r\ntches \nleft by what-ever tool the idiot used. Yes. it&#39;s only on the side \no=\r\npposite the (?)mei. \n\nThanks, let me know about the other character.\n\nEllio=\r\ntt \n\n--- In nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Barry Thomas&quot; &lt;warlord@...&gt; \nwro=\r\nte:\n&gt;\n&gt; Tom,\n&gt; \n&gt; It&#39;s a pretty lousy MUNE-  I have another character in mi=\r\nnd but \nhaven&#39;t looked for it yet.  It is well-known that most signatures o=\r\nn \nkogatana are spurious, and IMHO these are no exception.  Elliot, I \nam s=\r\norry but it pains me to say that the characters are crudely \nchiselled with=\r\n no finesse whatsoever.  A cursory run through my \nkogatana book does not r=\r\neveal any examples signed in such a \nrudimentary manner.  I have found a Ta=\r\ndahiro but it is nothing like \nthe piece under consideration.  I doubt ther=\r\ne is much to learn from \nthese pieces.  It always pays to bear in mind one =\r\nof Albert \nYamanaka&#39;s immortal sayings &quot;Looking at bad swords ruins your ey=\r\ne&quot;.  \nIt is no less true for kogatana...  But as Tom says, thanks for \npost=\r\ning Elliot.  As a counter to Albert&#39;s advice, one of my truisms \nhas always=\r\n been &quot;Look at everything&quot;...\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; Barry Thomas.\n&gt; \n&gt;   ----- Or=\r\niginal Message ----- \n&gt;   From: Tom Helm \n&gt;   To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.=\r\ncom \n&gt;   Sent: Wednesday, March 28, 2007 3:56 PM\n&gt;   Subject: Re: [nihontos=\r\ntudy] photos added to album\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   Elliott -\n&gt;   looks like quite a bit =\r\nof the mei is missing but I would look at \n&gt;   Hitachi no Kami Muneshige of=\r\n Settsu. Based on your photos that \nis my \n&gt;   best guess. I am also curiou=\r\ns about the temper you mentioned, is \nit \n&gt;   only on the reverse?
