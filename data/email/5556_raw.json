The guard \nhas been on my mind fore a few days. I used to have a tsuba now with you \nby Naooki so I have some stuff kicking about on the group. Let me look \ntonight.\n\nRich\n\nRon Hartmann wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi All -\n&gt;\n&gt; This is kind of a long-shot unless one of you are interested in \n&gt; shinshin-to smith Jirotaro Naokatsu&#39;s work with tsuba. These appear on \n&gt; the market from time to time, some examples more interesting than others.\n&gt;\n&gt; Examples of how they are signed seem to range from &quot;Jirotaro Naokatsu&quot; \n&gt; to niji-mei &quot;Naokatsu&quot; to &quot;Fujiwara Naokatsu.&quot; Does anyone have any \n&gt; research available if any of these mei-forms indicate the level of his \n&gt; works? Of course what &quot;seems&quot; somewhat logical, his &quot;signed long&quot; \n&gt; tsuba might indicate his better works, but then that&#39;s just my \n&gt; personal guess-work.\n&gt;\n&gt; Ron\n&gt; STL\n&gt;\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n&gt; \n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
