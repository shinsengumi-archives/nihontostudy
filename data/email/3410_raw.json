The NTHK will hold its annual big \n&gt; sword\n&gt; appreciation meeting on October 30th from 1 pm at our regular meeting \n&gt; place\n&gt; near Shinanomachi. The theme is famous Koto and koshirae. There is a \n&gt; 5,000\n&gt; yen fee for attendance. Anyone who wants to attend, but does not know \n&gt; how to\n&gt; get there can meet in front of Shinanomachi station at around one and \n&gt; I will\n&gt; be happy to guide you. Hope to see many of you soon. Also, as in the \n&gt; past,\n&gt; if everyone wants to get together for Saturday night dinner and \n&gt; drinks, let\n&gt; me know and I will get a reservation made.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Gordon\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
