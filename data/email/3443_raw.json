It isn&#39;t until legislators \nand the popula=\r\ntion in general realise that if it wasn&#39;t these cheap \nreplica edged weapon=\r\ns being used it would be something else just just \nas deadly, eg. machete, =\r\naxe etc. In fact most violent crime is \ncommitted with weapons of chance (t=\r\nhose that are to hand during fits \nof rage) and those crimes of violence co=\r\nmmitted by persons who make \nconscious use of a weapon in a planned way wou=\r\nld in no way be stopped \nfrom their crime by legislation that bans or restr=\r\nicts legitimate \ncollectors rights. This affects us and we should be aware =\r\nthat some \nwould believe that legislating against possession of edged weapo=\r\nns \nwould make society safer. John\n\n\n\n\n"
