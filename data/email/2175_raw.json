As usual with iron guards, a lot of the kantei comes in seeing the characteristics of the metal and its treatment in person.  The Kodai Hoan attribution came because the raised edges around the sukashi and mimi were formed by etching, a characteristic of later Hoan work.  Also remember that Kodai (later generation) Hoan is a different level of attribution than Hoan.  I&#39;m glad that you&#39;re happy with the attribution, I think it&#39;s a good one and certainly a lot more fun than Shoami.\n\nIt worked the other way on your dragon and Fuji-san tsuba, which was in Yanagawa style as you pointed out, but in person was not up to the level of Naoharu&#39;s work.  The dragon was very nicely chiseled, but the work was attributed to Mito Kinko, which matched my earlier &quot;internet kantei&quot; as I recall.\n\nMr. Pink Shirt didn&#39;t get one of the highest point values, but his guard by a very important maker did pass and was one of the highlights of the shinsa.  It was a great day for all concerned.  We had some really fine pieces come through.\n\nMilt, thanks for your hours manning the copy machine and outgoing table.  This shinsa was a bit different and we couldn&#39;t have done it without the people who stepped up to the job.  Moses Becerra, Tom Helm, Arnold Frenzel, John White, Fred Geyer and Bob Holcomb gave up most or all of their &quot;show time&quot; to make the shinsa happen, including some late night and very early morning hours for a few on Thursday/Friday.  I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll kick myself soon for forgetting to mention someone by name, but big thanks to all who did the work.\n\nJim  \n\n\n\n  Jim,\n\n  please klick...........\n\n  http://tinyurl.com/7xc7z\n\n  I am quite  pleasantly surprised that the tsuba was given an \n  attribution of &quot; mid edo Hoan &quot; by the shinsa team headed by Hagihara \n  sensei.\n  I recall we discussed this tsuba long time ago on this list that this \n  is most likely  a Shoami on an average day or a Umetada ( or \n  Myochin ) on a very very good day.\n\n  You mentioned briefly that it has something to do with the beveling \n  of the guard which I don&#39;t quite understand. Can you elaborate on \n  that ?\n\n  Thanks........\n\n  p.s.  Just found out from an old timer that it is indeed good luck to \n  wear pink on shinsa day.\n  That guy in pink tee shirt submitted one of the highest point score \n  tsuba !!\n\n  Milt\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
