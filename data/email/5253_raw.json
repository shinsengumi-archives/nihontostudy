Jointly signed works are very uncommon in fittings.  Most examples that I can think of are where the plate was prepared by one person and the decoration applied by another.  \n\n It&#39;d be an interesting study to assemble a group (even photos) of jointly signed pieces of any type.\n\nJim\n\nhttp://www.jimgilbertphoto.com/\n\n\nDear Lists,\n\nI&#39;ve been reading and researching Norisuke I &\nNorisuke II for a while. There is a good bit of\ninformation on them in Art & Sword Vol. 3, the Owari\nTsuba book, and even a book dedicated entirely to\ntheir work and that of a few of their students.\n\nQuestion: Has anyone ever seen a tsuba signed by\nboth Gen1 (&#39;Niwa&#39; Norisuke) and by Gen2 (&#39;Iwata&#39;\nNorisuke)?\nI would think there would be more than a few, as\ntheir lives overlapped a good bit.\n\nThere are no joint signed examples in the books, so\nI&#39;m hoping someone has seen or owns a joint work.\n\nThank you in advance,\n\nCurran\n\n__________________________________________________________\nNever miss a thing.
