From the colour of the metal I am guessing at a 16th century date although John Harding gave a Heian date to one in a catalogue he compiled! (One of the Sarzi-Amade selling catalogues).\n\nI think it possible that the maker was not a professional tsuba-ko as there is no reason to use such a complex construction method, the maker also does not seem to have a sense of the seppa-dai as a discrete area in itself, hence the curious decoration there that amazingly was applied before the nakago-ana was cut through.\n\nPerhaps the makers of these tsuba were artisans who used this thin sheet yamagane for other purposes and saw a gap in the tsuba market. Does anyone know of other uses for this type of thin plate and decoration? \n\nI have seen these illustrated in japanese books, the only one that comes immediately to mind is in Nihon Toban Zusetsu by Takezawa, probably by the same maker as mine, as the same defective spiral punch was used for both tsuba, Takezawa called it &#39;ko-kinko&#39; Any thoughts on this will be gratefully received.\n\nAlan\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
