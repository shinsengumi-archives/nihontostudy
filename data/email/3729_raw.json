If I understood correctly all iron  \n&gt; tosho style tsuba appropriat=\r\nely enough. I would love to see one in  \n&gt; person myself.\n&gt; \t\tYour page say=\r\ns; This is a Tosho tsuba with kokuin impressed in a  \n&gt; tsuchime-ji by Suis=\r\nhinshi Masahide. Masahides&#39; great contribution to  \n&gt; the world of the Japa=\r\nnese sword is evidenced by one well known fact,  \n&gt; and that is that the Sh=\r\ninshinto era begins with the emergence of this  \n&gt; very artist. His strengt=\r\nh, his energy are evidenced by his having  \n&gt; answered the demands of the t=\r\nimes all the while fostering over 100  \n&gt; students. He was an extraordinary=\r\n educator.\n&gt; \tIn Token Benkyo Kai first place is Ten (Heaven), second place=\r\n is Chi  \n&gt; (Earth) and third place is &quot;Jin&quot; (Man). With this work Masahide=\r\n makes  \n&gt; reference to that as well as Buddhistic themes. It is thought wi=\r\nth  \n&gt; this tsuba Masahide is showing us a miniature universe, his kokuin  =\r\n\n&gt; reading &quot;Niten&quot; is an abbreviation of Nitenji, a guardian deity who  \n&gt; =\r\nis the same as Nichirin (the orb of heaven, the sun).\n&gt; \tIn Bunsei Gannen M=\r\nasahide changed his name to Amahide, one story has  \n&gt; it that the &quot;Ama&quot; wa=\r\ns granted to him by lord Akimoto, suggesting a  \n&gt; link to the first great =\r\nswordsmith Amakuni and &quot;lord of swordmakers  \n&gt; heaven.&quot;\n&gt; \tThe metal is a =\r\nbit on the hard side but the color and texture are  \n&gt; excellent, this is a=\r\n rare and well known piece.\n&gt;\n&gt; \tAt least that is what I think it says...\n&gt;=\r\n -t\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt; Yahoo!
