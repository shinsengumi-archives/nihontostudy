In the\nauction are several remarkable Toku Juyo that are\nworth a good look. I&#39;ve seen the Choji in person and\nwish I could have seen the Norishige.\n\nChristie&#39;s:\nhttp://www.christies.com/LotFinder/lfsearch/SearchResults.aspx?intSaleID=20862\n\nhttp://tinyurl.com/2cceb9\n\n\nAlso in the auction are several tsuba that belonged to\nme previously and are being sold by the current owner.\n   When the catalog arrived, I was surprised to see\nthat several of the decriptions were in error and also\nmade no mention of their NBTHK papers. The errors have\nbeen corrected online, though I do not think all of\nthe ones with papers have been updated. Among them are\nsigned and papered Ichijosai Hirotoshi (NBTHK),\nIchiryu Tomoyoshi (NBTHK), and Isso (NBTHK)tsuba. The\nshakudo Tomoyoshi was a favorite I regret needing to\nsell.\n\n\nCurran\n\n\n   \n\n\n \n____________________________________________________________________________________\nFinding fabulous fares is fun.  \nLet Yahoo!
