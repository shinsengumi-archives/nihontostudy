As one who has always admired quality menuki, I can only recall one small article that appeared in NBTHK&#39;s Token Bijutsu many years ago that showed a fellow making menuki, Goto style. That was perhaps 15 or more years ago and I&#39;ve yet to find anyone who has ever written anything (in any detail) about the making of menuki. I&#39;m not even sure if today&#39;s artists in Japan even make menuki. If anyone has knowledge of these techniques, it would be a wonderful service to us if an extensive article -- not just a fluff article -- could be written on the subject for publication on the various styles of making menuki and their decoration. (The making of fuchi/kashira is another neglected subject!) \n\nRon\nSTL\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: klepet33319 \n  To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Friday, May 19, 2006 10:19 AM\n  Subject: [nihontostudy] Menuki Fabrication Question\n\n\n  Good day all.  I was looking at examples of Goto menuki this morning \n  and I am curious if anyone knows how these were fabricated with \n  different metals contituting the design?  I can see how gold could be \n  overlaid, but how would they construct something this small with \n  shakudo, silver and gold parts?  Thanks!\n  Pete Klein\n\n\n\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  YAHOO! GROUPS LINKS \n\n    a..
