It is of a violet/black shakudo, and was purchased by its\n&gt; previous owner in 1938.  It depicts, in a delicate openwork, a bell\n&gt; cricket amidst suzuki grasses.  The grass is decorated with gold\n&gt; taka-zogan dewdrops.\n&gt;\n&gt; I have always thought, by reason of the &#39;brightness&#39; of its\n&gt; execution, the lack of any evidence of it ever having been mounted,\n&gt; and sekigane in the nakago-hitsu that appear more decorative than\n&gt; functional, that it was Edo work.\n&gt;\n&gt; During a recent visit to the Bing exhibition, at the Van Gough\n&gt; Museum in Amsterdam, I saw a very similar guard on loan from the\n&gt; Museum fur Kunst et Kewerbe in Hamburg - stupidly I omitted to\n&gt; record its accession number.  This was attributed to Nakai Zensuke\n&gt; Tomotsune I (1669 -1730.  Can I be so wrong in the dating of my own\n&gt; tsuba?\n&gt;\n&gt; With my thanks in advance for any suggestions\n&gt; John L.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
