Very\nlong nagasa, and appears to be o-surige. Has an o-kiss=\r\naki, and well\ncut naginata-type hi. Nakago looks to be around shinshinto pe=\r\nriod, but\njust my novice opinion.\nWhat is odd about the sword (apart from t=\r\nhe fact that it looks like a\nnagamaki blade made into a katana) is the insc=\r\nription on the blade on\nboth sides.\nSorry for the bad pics. Only had 5 minu=\r\ntes to take these limited pics\ntoday, and had to do them in segments in bad=\r\n light. The sword has a\nbeefy blade, with some weight to it, and the hi are=\r\n very nicely cut.\nHamon is not very visible in the pics, but is clearly vis=\r\nible in\nperson, and quite wide suguha.\nAnyways, a translation done very lon=\r\ng ago supposedly came up with\nsomething along the lines of &quot;I am so sharp, =\r\nI can cut clouds&quot; but I\nhave strong doubts about this.\nLooking for a transl=\r\nation from anyone please.\nWhat would the significance of the inscription be=\r\n, and could it be a\ngift sword or a dedication, or a commission blade? Fitt=\r\nings are nice\ntachi mounts, and the blade doesn&#39;t appear to my humble eyes =\r\nto be a\njunk sword. Original nagasa would be estimated at well over 28&quot;\nori=\r\nginally.\n\nA post on another forum gave the following helpful info:\n&quot;This in=\r\nscription is most likely a reference to something found in\nChinese literatu=\r\nre or Chinese mythology. I say this because its not\nmade up of typical Japa=\r\nnese compounds and doesn&#39;t resemble any\nBuddhist phrases that one typically=\r\n sees on swords. I think the 3rd\nand 4th kanji combine to form the word &quot;li=\r\nghtning&quot; in Chinese\n(somebody correct me if I&#39;m wrong), but the word for li=\r\nghtning in\nJapanese uses a different kanji. Read kanji-for-kanji as Japanes=\r\ne you\nend up with a jumble of word roots. The kanji on the left are\n&#21091=\r\n;&#20809;&#38275;&#38651;&#38829;&#20992;&#36637;&#30772;&#28014;&#38642;\nW=\r\nhen translated it reads; sword, light, lightning (taking the Chinese\nreadin=\r\ng), whip, katana, brilliant, rupture, floating, and cloud. It\ndoesn&#39;t take =\r\nmuch imagination to read this as you have stated in your\npost (&quot;Lightning-f=\r\nlashing, cloud-rupturing sword&quot;). But as I say its\nprobably a direct refere=\r\nnce to a particular myth or poem, which\ncontains this exact phrase. The own=\r\ner would then have the added bonus\nof appearing quite erudite and well-read=\r\n in the Chinese classics. I\nthink samurai were keen on secret societies and=\r\n this inscription may\nhave some significance in this context as well. In an=\r\ny event its not a\nphrase that you would encounter in Japanese, which leads =\r\nme to believe\nit&#39;s a Chinese literary reference.&quot;\n\n\nThanks in advance.\n\nBri=\r\nan\n\nhttp://img453.imageshack.us/img453/9931/nagamaki1mx.jpg\nhttp://img481.i=\r\nmageshack.us/img481/1333/nagamaki36qy.jpg\n\n\n\n\n\n"
