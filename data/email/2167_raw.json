It\ncontained a rather long article by Paul R. Allman, titled  &quot;Visions within\nVisions: The Nature of Aesthetics and the Japanese Sword as Fine Art.&quot;\nMr. Allman advances a long and complicated set of theories about art in\ngeneral, and the Japanese sword as art in particular which need not detain\nus, but he also reminiscences a good deal about personal experiences of his\nown in the study and appreciation of Nihonto.\n\nAllman writes (p.52):\n\n&quot;Albert Yamanaka used to stress to me that that the Honami tradition\nconsidered the jitetsu as the ultimate &#39;point&#39; in appraisal.  He told me\nthat it was most difficult to learn.  It took many years and was nearly\nimpossible for a Westerner to learn because we did not get access to swords\nfrom each school to compare.  But, he added, the actual iron that was used\nat each place during each era was the one thing that could not be\ncounterfeited.  First, the counterfeiter couldn&#39;t get the same kind of iron,\nand second, iron changes as it ages, and there is no way to fake the aging.&quot;\n\nI believe the &quot;point&quot; in question would be the precise color of the iron in\nthe ji.  I was aware that the steel of Koto blades tends to look blue, while\nShinto steel is more yellow, but I had not realised that discernable\ndifferences in jitetsu between schools generally existed, apart from a few\ncases.\n\nI was wondering if (a) anyone in Japan had done colored jitetsu photos, or\nif (b) there was a substantial textual discussion of jitetsu differences to\nbe found.\n\nDavid\n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;Tom Helm&quot; &lt;junkmail@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Monday, September 20, 2004 8:57 PM\nSubject: Re: [nihontostudy] Jitetsu\n\n\nYes,\nThe Nihonto Kantei Dokuhon, otherwise known as the Connoisseur&#39;s guide\nto the Japanese Sword, and many more for that matter...\n-t\n\nOn Sep 20, 2004, at 4:46 PM, David Zincavage wrote:\n\n&gt; Has any book ever been published in Japan illustrating specifically\n&gt; the differing jitetsu of the Gokaden?\n&gt;\n&gt;  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
