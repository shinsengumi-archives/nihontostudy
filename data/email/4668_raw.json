I will definitely reread them and pay more attention as=\r\n I\ndo!!\n\nThanks again,\n\nDave\n--- In nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com, &quot;peonies_=\r\nwaves&quot; &lt;peonies_waves@...&gt;\nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hello Dave,\n&gt;\n&gt; Based on the images, =\r\nit needs to be determined whether this sword has\n&gt; been exposed to serious =\r\nheat. The scaly-dry appearance of the steel\n&gt; is an indication that it migh=\r\nt have been. Fires were a problem\n&gt; throughout Japan&#39;s history that affecte=\r\nd many swords. There are\n&gt; articles written that describe to some degree wh=\r\nat characteristics to\n&gt; look for.\n&gt; In general, this is one lesson many beg=\r\ninners unfortunately\n&gt; experience at one time or another.\n&gt;\n&gt; regards,\n&gt; Fr=\r\nanco\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com, &quot;dwmac2000&quot; dwmac2000@\n&gt; =\r\nwrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hello Again,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve managed to post a few photos i=\r\nn my album titled &quot; Interesting\n&gt; &gt; Sword.&quot; The pictures are mediocre at be=\r\nst, but will hopefully show\n&gt; &gt; some of its charactoristics. The grain line=\r\ns in the hada 2 photo\n&gt; &gt; actually shine brightly as opposed to what is see=\r\nn in the picture.\n&gt; &gt; There is a bit of the hamon which can be seen in the =\r\nupper section\n&gt; &gt; of the hamon 1 photo. The sword is in obvious need of pol=\r\nish. It\n&gt; &gt; laid on the battlefield at Okinawa during WWll for several days=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; before being discovered by a young Marine. It was stored away with\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n little or no attention since. Oddly, the sword seemed to have\n&gt; found\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nme as opposed to the other way around.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m trying to research the s=\r\nword and have a little knowledge from\n&gt; &gt; research I did on swords my Fathe=\r\nr brought home from WWll as a 11th\n&gt; &gt; Airborne Paratrooper. I didn&#39;t reali=\r\nze what I was getting into!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve had some much appreciated input fr=\r\nom Ron and Ricky. I still\n&gt; &gt; think judging from the Nakago condition the s=\r\nword is most likely a\n&gt; &gt; Bakumatsu era Ko-to copy. If anyone should happen=\r\n to have opinion\n&gt; &gt; as to time period or otherwise based on the photos it =\r\nwould be\n&gt; again\n&gt; &gt; greatly appreciated!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Dave\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n"
