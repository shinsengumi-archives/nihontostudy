Still working on that. Also the shot, if it was \niron. Also tr=\r\nying to peg down the first importation of iron by the \nPortugese. Orandatet=\r\nsu first or Portotetsu, for want of a better \nword. Let you know. John\n\n---=\r\n In nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Gordon Robson&quot; &lt;robsongo@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; Hi Barry,\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; I will check through my sources when I get home lat=\r\ner today. I do \nnot recall\n&gt; ever seeing a first generation Yasutsugu with =\r\na Namban-tetsu \ninscription,\n&gt; and if one exits, being dated will be extrao=\r\nrdinary. On the other \nhand, my\n&gt; memory may just be faulty. We can also go=\r\n back to Oda Nobunaga for \nthe\n&gt; &quot;foreign dress&quot; thing. He is said to have =\r\nhad a Namban-gusoku and \nhis\n&gt; standard was a Portuguese hat. He also affec=\r\nted foreign wear. \nNonetheless, I\n&gt; still suspect that the importation of s=\r\nteel came after the Dutch \nwere set up\n&gt; in Dejima, the country was pacifie=\r\nd and smiths were largely \nestablished in\n&gt; large urban centers. That would=\r\n put the use back past 1615 and the \nfall of\n&gt; Osaka castle. \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; I=\r\nt is interesting that Yasutsugu should be negatively compared to \nUmetada\n&gt;=\r\n Myoju in terms of blade making. Myoju left scant numbers of swords \nand is=\r\n\n&gt; really not considered much of a sword-smith. Horikawa Kunihiro is \nlarge=\r\nly\n&gt; credited with starting the Shinto tradition due to the large number \no=\r\nf\n&gt; swords he produced and the size of his school, which included the \nfoun=\r\nders\n&gt; of the Osaka Shinto. Yasutsugu at his best is excellent, but he \nsee=\r\nms to\n&gt; have produced a lot of so-so stuff.\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Gordon\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\n-----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n[mailto:ni=\r\nhontostudy@yahoogroups.com] On\n&gt; Behalf Of Barry Thomas\n&gt; Sent: Friday, Feb=\r\nruary 23, 2007 9:50 AM\n&gt; To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: Re: [n=\r\nihontostudy] Re: NAMBAN TETSU\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; John alerted us to the nihonto.co=\r\nm Yasutsugu article, which stated:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; About this time, non oriental for=\r\neigners made \n&gt; &gt; their presence felt in Japan for the first time.

About this time \n&gt; Yasutsugu was given the privilege of using=\r\n the character &quot;Yasu&quot; \nfrom \n&gt; Tokugawa Ieyasu&#39;s name. Thus he changed his =\r\nname to Yasutsugu from \n&gt; that point on. About the same time ( some feel it=\r\n was a few years \n&gt; later) he was given the additional privilege of carving=\r\n the \nHollyhock \n&gt; crest ( Aoi mon) on his blades. These privileges were gi=\r\nven in \n&gt; perpetuity to Yasutsugu and his descendents. Thus the Yasutsugu \n=\r\n&gt; swordsmiths became the kaji of the Tokugawa Family.\n&gt; \n&gt; Earlier I raised=\r\n the question of what made Yasutsugu&#39;s fame and \n&gt; fortune seem to spread d=\r\nisproportionately to his skill when we \n&gt; compare him to some of his contem=\r\nporary smiths such as Umetada \nMyoju \n&gt; and Horikawa Kunihiro. About this t=\r\nime, non oriental foreigners \nmade \n&gt; their presence felt in Japan for the =\r\nfirst time. Things from \n&gt; the &quot;West&quot; were new, exciting, strange, and high=\r\nly sought after. \n&gt; Yasutsugu was one of the first advocates of using namba=\r\nn tetsu \n&gt; (foreign steel) in his swords. He proudly incised this fact on t=\r\nhe \n&gt; nakago of his later works. It was new, it was exciting, and there \nis=\r\n \n&gt; no doubt that this use of foreign steel helped spread his fameis is \n&gt; =\r\nfrom an article on nihonto.com\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nihontostudy@ &lt;mailto:nihontostu=\r\ndy%40yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; yahoogroups.com, &quot;Alan Bale&quot; &lt;abale@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; To All,\n&gt; &gt; Yasutsugu 1st inscribed &#39;Nanban tetsu wo motte&#39; on some of hi=\r\ns \n&gt; swords, according to the Meikan his dated blades range from 1613 to \n&gt;=\r\n 1621\n&gt; &gt; Alan\n&gt; . \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been re=\r\nmoved]\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been remov=\r\ned]\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"
