I\npresume this has to do with the fact that Shinto steel is quite\ndifferent to Koto steel, with most of it being Namban or a variation\nthereof as described in question 1. \n \n3.    - Last but not least he describes Koto blades as being &quot;blue&quot;. Now\nI have seen a couple and would agree that they do look bluish. Is this\nwhy people sometimes call them &quot;wet&quot; ? Also if you had to assign a color\nto Shinto blades what would it be ?\n \n \nMany thanks in advance, Matthew\n \n\n\n    Z Recruiting Services\n    &quot;Zurich Toren&quot; Muzenstraat 89\n    2511 WB Den Haag\n    T: +31 70 4262273\n    F: +31 70 4262111\n    W: zrecruiting.com\n    E: info@...\n    Kijk ook op monsterboard.nl, jobbingmall.nl en \n    nationalevacaturebank.nl voor actuele vacatures!\n\n \n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
