It is not papered, but, he wrote this info on the bill of =\r\n\nsale: &quot; The old village of Tochihata eventually became Izumo in \nShimane P=\r\nrefecture;  during early Edo, the tsubako of this village \nspecialized in m=\r\naking tsuba with the ji as carved rope, hence the \nname Tochihata for this =\r\ntype of tsuba&quot; [mine is a roped mimi].\nFrom this statement from him, I conj=\r\necture that a &#39;roped&#39; mimi tsuba \ncalled &#39;Tochibata&#39; does&#39;t refer to a mei =\r\nof &quot;Tochibata&quot;, but to \nhaving been made on the island of Tochibata. It is =\r\npossible that \nthere are no tsuba with a mei &quot;Tochibata&quot;.  I welcome all co=\r\nrrections \nto the above. \n\n--- In nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com, Curran Camp=\r\nbell \n&lt;neobliviscar@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; List,\n&gt; \n&gt; I am hoping a lurker out the=\r\nre might be able to\n&gt; comment on Tochibata tsuba. I am familiar with them a=\r\ns\n&gt; written up on page 58-59 of Harry Watson&#39;s Nihonto\n&gt; Koza translation o=\r\nf Kodogu Part 1.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ve seen a limited number of these over the years,\n&gt;=\r\n and they are distinct enough to me that I feel they\n&gt; constitute a distinc=\r\nt _if minor_ school.\n&gt; \n&gt; Q1:  Has anyone ever seen a tsuba NBTHK / NTHK pa=\r\npered\n&gt; to Tochibata?\n&gt; \n&gt; Q2:  Can anyone point me to further writing on t=\r\nhis\n&gt; school?\n&gt; \n&gt; They tend to be strong solid open tsuba that remind of\n&gt;=\r\n Owari, are thick, yet very clean. The last I saw was\n&gt; identical to the on=\r\ne on the bottom of NihontoKoza pg.\n&gt; 59 and sold as &quot;Owari&quot;.  I suspect the=\r\n papering\n&gt; authorities just designate them &quot;Owari&quot;, but hope to\n&gt; find an =\r\neither one papered Tochibata or hope to find\n&gt; another source beyond the Ni=\r\nhonto Koza.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks in advance,\n&gt; \n&gt; Curran\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n______________=\r\n________________________________________________________\n______________\n&gt; D=\r\no you Yahoo!?\n&gt; Everyone is raving about the all-new Yahoo!
