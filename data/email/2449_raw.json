I have never, personally, seen illustrations of samurai wearing their swords on the right side, and it is not inconceivable that they were trained at an early age to use their swords in the conventional manner.  The only advantage in being left handed is, surely, its comparative rarity and strangeness to a right-handed opponent.\n\nInterestingly, I have in my collection (WAY 386.27.ex Gardiner collection) an unsigned,  shakudo fuchi-gashira, attributed to Hirata Harunari  This has an ishime surface, with takaramono in a shippo of coloured enamels within gold cloissons.  The ura surface of the fuchi has had an additional takaramono added in gold lacquer, and this may possibly be to facilitate its wearing on the right side by presenting a more decorative surface.  I can think of no other possible explanation for this modification.\n\nJohn L.\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
