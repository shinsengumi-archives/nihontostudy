The sayagaki by Homma sensei stated\n&gt; : explicitly that the sword was saiba but because of it&#39;s\n&gt; : extreme importance as reference material was granted Juyo status.\n&gt; : The only other extant example being in the\n&gt; : Imperial Household Collection (Gyobutsu).\n&gt; : It was sold to a Japanese dealer who understood its importance.\n&gt; : P.S. It was signed Chikamura Murakami.\n&gt; : The Murakami was not added later, but is read as tatematsuru.\n&gt; :\n&gt; : Regards,\n&gt; : Cary Condell\n&gt; :\n&gt; : Condell & Co., Ltd.\n&gt; : P.O.
