I do not know the &quot;story&quot; behind it, if t=\r\nhere is one, but it is probably a early 19th century sort of revival piece =\r\nbased on earlier Heianjo-zogan types. I think it is rather too sophisticate=\r\nd for the more direct earlier material and it might be a combination of sue=\r\nmon inlay and nunome (the rain??? - can&#39;t tell from the image) in which cas=\r\ne it would be late for sure. It could, assuming no nunome, be late Muromach=\r\ni thru very early Edo too, based on the large size nakago ana, as large bla=\r\ndes were carried then and in the 19th Cent. as well, but the design seems t=\r\noo cute.  How thick is it?\n AF\n \n\n\n\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; jdz@... 10/12/05 1:15 PM &gt;&gt;&gt;\nI=\r\n recently purchased from Japan an unusually large tsuba.  It is done in\nbot=\r\nh positive and negative sukashi, and inlaid with silver and brass.  The\ndes=\r\nign features a Genji wheel and a thunderstorm.  A lightning bolt strikes\nth=\r\ne ground in negative sukashi, while brass lines of rain pour down beneath\nc=\r\nlouds in negative sukashi and a positive silver crescent moon.  The rim\nsho=\r\nws thunder inlaid in brass.\n\nMy references do not discuss the combination o=\r\nf Genji wheel and\nthunderstorm.  Does anyone know anything about that motif=\r\n combination?\n\nI&#39;m just starting to research this tsuba.  Note the large si=\r\nze, almost 9 cm.\nIt came in an oversized tsuba box.  It is surprisingly int=\r\nact, but shows\nwear.  Opinions on school?\n\nhttp://zincavage.org/WheelandLig=\r\nhtningTsuba.html\n\n\nDavid Zincavage\n\n\n\n\n \nYahoo!
