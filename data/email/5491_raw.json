The brass fittings do not look to be of Japanese\n&gt; workmanship, especially the lack of a proper and neat finish where the\n&gt; metal\n&gt; edges meet the scabbard wood. This is especially true where the handle\n&gt; butts\n&gt; up to the habaki. The lack of a facing metal piece to the habaki indicates\n&gt; poor workmanship. It may all be modern, but the proof of the pudding for\n&gt; the\n&gt; blade will be when you take the handle off and see the tang. Do this -\n&gt; remove the habaki and take good closeup photos of both sides of the tang\n&gt; and\n&gt; put them up. The blade is the typical shape of a Meiji tourist piece, but\n&gt; running through the images again I&#39;m of the opinion that the koshirae is\n&gt; modern as it just does not have the refinement of shape that we expect to\n&gt; see in Japanese workmanship. So the blade may be old, but if it does not\n&gt; have a clear and distinguishable hamon it is nonetheless a &quot;junk&quot; piece.\n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; Barry Thomas\n&gt; (Melbourne, Australia)\n&gt;\n&gt; ----- Original Message -----\n&gt; From: Patrik Danielsson\n&gt; To: nihontostudy@ &lt;mailto:nihontostudy%40yahoogroups.com&gt; yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Sent: Thursday, November 27, 2008 8:27 AM\n&gt; Subject: [nihontostudy] Question about a small Tanto or??\n&gt;\n&gt; Hello everybody, i bought this small &quot;tanto&quot; on an ad here in Sweden.\n&gt; Its feel really genunine, some kind of hard wood whith nice graining in\n&gt; saya\n&gt; and tsuka, on some places it looks like all the brass has been\n&gt; silverplated\n&gt; (can still se it above tha habaki on one of the photos), i have not been\n&gt; able to take the tsuka of it yet,but i gonna do that,(depending of the\n&gt; answers here :-)\n&gt; Can this be a &quot;tourist&quot; thing , or is it made for a child , women or\n&gt; something like that?, if someone have some info age or something i will\n&gt; really happy.\n&gt;\n&gt; The blade from grip (above habaki) to tip is 6.5 inches / 17 cm, and the\n&gt; total is 10 inches/ 25.5 cm.\n&gt;\n&gt; Here is some pictures of it:\n&gt;\n&gt; http://s74.photobuc\n&gt; &lt;http://s74.photobucket.com/albums/i248/wellcraftantiqua/japan/&gt;\n&gt; ket.com/albums/i248/wellcraftantiqua/japan/\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks alot\n&gt;\n&gt; Patrik\n&gt; .\n&gt;\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n&gt; ----------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; No virus found in this incoming message.\n&gt; Checked by AVG.\n&gt; Version: 7.5.549 / Virus Database: 270.9.10/1814 - Release Date:\n&gt; 2008-11-26\n&gt; 20:53\n&gt;\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"
