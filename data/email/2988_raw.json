The design with two bo=\r\nxes is called sayu-masu (left and right boxes).    \n\nMy Japanese language s=\r\nkills are minimal, but I only know of nihiki as the &quot;counting word&quot; used fo=\r\nr two small animals. I asked my shodo teacher (first native speaker I remem=\r\nbered to ask) if she could think of any other meaning for nihiki or a way t=\r\nhat it might relate to that motif, but no luck.  \n\nDo you know what the kan=\r\nji are for that nihiki?  \n\nIt just occurred to me to try a google image sea=\r\nrch on nihiki.  Most hits are photos of pairs of dogs, cats, rabbits, etc.,=\r\n but interestingly this jpg http://www005.upp.so-net.ne.jp/minbun/news/news=\r\n21/nihiki.jpg\nof a kimono turned up.  Kimono sleeves are normally called so=\r\nde as far as I know, but the two rectangular sleeves would fit the two rect=\r\nangle motif.  The nihiki  =E4=BA=8C=E5=BC=95 in the caption I think refers =\r\nto the kind of garment, but I don&#39;t know the meaning.  It&#39;s probably a red =\r\nherring.  The source page is here:\n\nhttp://www005.upp.so-net.ne.jp/minbun/n=\r\news/news21/news21.html\n\nOddly on the same page I noticed this \nhttp://www00=\r\n5.upp.so-net.ne.jp/minbun/news/news21/kodougu.jpg\nwhich looks like a large =\r\nharvesting knife in shirasaya with a koshirae.  I&#39;ve seen plenty of bamboo =\r\nsplitting knives with blades like that, but not with a habaki or koshirae. =\r\n Something for a performance?  Does anyone know?\n\nJim\n\n\n\n  Dear Members\n\n  =\r\nCan anybody please tell me what is meant by the term &#39;nihiki design&#39;?  \n  I=\r\nt appears to refer to a tsuba design incorporating two rectangular \n  openi=\r\nngs, one on each side of the seppa-dai, but I have never been \n  able to id=\r\nentify what, if anything, these represent.\n\n  Regards, John L.\n\n\n\n[Non-text=\r\n portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
