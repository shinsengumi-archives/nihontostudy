As for your above comments, I\nthink I have firmly established what I like.  Seperate\nfrom these discussed pieces, I am seeking out various\nother schools from the Mito Shoami type to have a\nrepresentation of all the schools that used the mantis\nin their work.  My humble collection of 12 tsuba is\ngrowing with representation of both kinko and sukashi.\nI really would love to put out a book one day on just\nmantis fittings.  Whoever owns that tsuba on the\nNorthern California site please feel free to leave\nthat to me in my will.  Given that however, I do like\nthese Mito tsuba and kinda like the idea of having a\npotential dai-sho for mounting or at least 1 for\ndisplay and 1 for mounting.  Thanks again.\nKen\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nFree Pop-Up Blocker - Get it now\nhttp://companion.yahoo.com/\n\n"
