A mate and I were talkin swod \ntok the\n&gt; other night and we were discussing tanto. He mentioned and sent \npics of\n&gt; a very small blade that measures app 22cm in total length. As it \nturns\n&gt; out, I have one almost identical in size. Mine, as is his is also \nquite\n&gt; thick, both about 7 or 8 mm at the munemachi, very much like a\n&gt; yorio-doshi only far too short.\n&gt; \n&gt; Paul mentioned that he was told his was made as a gift for the \nwife of a\n&gt; samurai as a wedding present. He believes his to be mid/late edo \nand\n&gt; traditionally made. MIne is out of polish and hard to see hada or \nhamon,\n&gt; nie, nioi etc.. but the rest of it looks pretty similar.\n&gt; \n&gt; here is a link to the two tanto Tantos \n&lt;www.whiz.com.au/richard/tantos.jpg&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; I believe blades were common gifts for samurai wife&#39;s and I would \nexpect\n&gt; them to be smaller than usual but 22 cm is pretty small and more \nlike a\n&gt; child&#39;s size, though I guess weilded properly, could inflict just \nas\n&gt; much damage as a 30cm tanto.\n&gt; \n&gt; looking forward to all opinions.\n&gt; \n&gt; cheers\n&gt; \n&gt; Rich\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
