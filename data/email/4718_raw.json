If your sword is a shinto sw=\r\nord, it \nwas almost for certain carried by a samurai. The question then \nbe=\r\ncomes, if this sword was good enough for a real samurai without a \nbo-hi, h=\r\now is it that it is suddenly not good enough without a bo-hi \nnow? \n\nAdditi=\r\nonally, isn&#39;t cutting a &#39;striking event&#39;, and if it is, isn&#39;t \nfinal moment=\r\num a critical factor in addition to cutting motion? And, \nisn&#39;t momentum ma=\r\nde up of mass X velocity? Therefore, by removing \nmetal for a bo-hi won&#39;t t=\r\nhat reduce the mass, thereby reduce the \nstriking force of the cut? While y=\r\nou could possibly increase the \nvelocity with a lighter sword to compensate=\r\n some, the best result \nwould come from a combination of both.\n\nHistoricall=\r\ny, the reason for bo-hi is to reduce battle fatigue \n(lactic acid build up)=\r\n from making cut after cut for an extended \nperiod of time. \n\n\nregards,\nFra=\r\nnco\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com, Enore Gardonio &lt;egardon@...&gt;=\r\n \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Thank you Peter. I will certainly keep the advice in mind. Don=\r\n&#39;t \nforget \n&gt; though, a sword is made for a reason and I don&#39;t believe its =\r\nfor \n&gt; appreciation of its beauty. First and foremost it was made to be \nus=\r\ned. I \n&gt; see nothing wrong with practicing with it. I intend to take very \n=\r\ngood \n&gt; care of it.......... I consider myself  very lucky to own such a \np=\r\niece.\n&gt; Enore\n&gt; \n&gt; Peter A Bleed wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Enore,\n&gt; &gt; I want to second Gor=\r\ndon&#39;s advice. I would urge you not to alter \nyour  sword\n&gt; &gt; in the way you=\r\n are describing. If you want a grooved blade order \none or\n&gt; &gt; find one. At=\r\n the very least you should not do anything until you \nhave had\n&gt; &gt; your bla=\r\nde well shinsa&#39;d.\n&gt; &gt; Still, your question does point up a basic feature of=\r\n the world of\n&gt; &gt; nippon-to. The values and standards of the various people=\r\n \ninvolved in\n&gt; &gt; Japanese swords are diverse. What is absolutely &quot;wrong&quot; t=\r\no some \nis &quot;just\n&gt; &gt; fine&quot; to others. Most of us base our actions on our vi=\r\news of \naesthetics and\n&gt; &gt; a sense of historical preservation. There are ot=\r\nher values out \nthere and\n&gt; &gt; knowing that helps to understand some of the =\r\nthings we see about \nswords.\n&gt; &gt; When I was first in Japan I happened to me=\r\net a number of sword \ncraftsmen\n&gt; &gt; rather than collectors. Of course this =\r\nwas interesting (heck, it \nwas\n&gt; &gt; wonderful), but it may have given me a s=\r\nkewed view.\n&gt; &gt; 1. The first &quot;smith&quot; I met ( and he was an important artist=\r\n-and a\n&gt; &gt; wonderful person) was re-tempering some old swords when I visite=\r\nd \nhis\n&gt; &gt; forge.\n&gt; &gt; 2.  An important kinko proudly showed me his portfoli=\r\no that \nincluded some\n&gt; &gt; very excellent &quot;umegane&quot; work he had done. He ass=\r\nured me that &quot;no \none could\n&gt; &gt; see&quot; the fillings he had put into some seri=\r\nously flawed blades.\n&gt; &gt; 3. During a road trip with a fellow who had recent=\r\nly completed his\n&gt; &gt; polishing apprenticeship, we took a long extra trip to=\r\n let his \nteacher see\n&gt; &gt; the grooves he was carving on a tanto. He was pro=\r\nud of his work \nand his\n&gt; &gt; master approved. When I asked why he was doing =\r\nit, he said &quot;the \nsmith\n&gt; &gt; should have put the grooves in.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; These men =\r\nare not crooks or villains. Indeed, I think they are \ngreat\n&gt; &gt; artists and=\r\n skilled students, but they operate with a different \nset of\n&gt; &gt; values.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; You certainly can find craftsmen who will do what you ask of \nthem, but o=\r\nne\n&gt; &gt; thing is clear. You will only be able to cut grooves in your \nsword =\r\nonce. I\n&gt; &gt; urge you to proceed with caution.\n&gt; &gt; Peter\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Peter Bleed=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; Professor of Anthropology\n&gt; &gt; 810 Oldfather Hall\n&gt; &gt; University of Neb=\r\nraska\n&gt; &gt; Lincoln, NE 68588-0368\n&gt; &gt; (402) 472-2439\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;           =\r\n                                                          \n       \n&gt; &gt;     =\r\n         &quot;Gordon \nRobson&quot;                                               \n&gt; =\r\n&gt;              \n&lt;robsongo@...                                             \n=\r\n&gt; &gt;              \njp&gt;                                                      =\r\n  To \n&gt; &gt;              Sent by:                  \n&lt;nihontostudy@yahoogroups=\r\n.com&gt;      \n&gt; &gt;              \nnihontostudy@yaho                            =\r\n              cc \n&gt; &gt;              \nogroups.com                            =\r\n                       \n&gt; \n&gt;                                               =\r\n                     \nSubject \n&gt; &gt;                                        R=\r\nE: [nihontostudy] Bo-\nhi            \n&gt; &gt;              12/05/2006 \n05:16    =\r\n                                          \n&gt; &gt;              \nPM            =\r\n                                                \n&gt; \n&gt;                      =\r\n                                               \n       \n&gt; \n&gt;               =\r\n                                                      \n       \n&gt; &gt;         =\r\n     Please respond \nto                                             \n&gt; &gt;   =\r\n           \nnihontostudy@yaho                                             \n=\r\n&gt; &gt;                 \nogroups.com                                           =\r\n     \n&gt; \n&gt;                                                                 =\r\n    \n       \n&gt; \n&gt;                                                          =\r\n           \n       \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hi Enore,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Are you talking a=\r\nbout taking an antique sword and cutting a \ngroove in it?
