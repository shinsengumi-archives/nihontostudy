Who cares if he gives you a neg. on \nan account with little or no feedback ? \n\nThat is what I did. \n\n- Matt \n\n\n\n--- In nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com, samurai@x wrote:\n&gt; &lt;condell@i...&gt; writes:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; I love it.  If eBay doesn&#39;t respond I can outbid you all near \nthe end\n&gt; &gt; of the sale and either: 1. Retract my bid explaining the fraud \ncausing\n&gt; &gt; the house of cards to come tumbling down.  2. &quot;Win&quot; the auction, \nget\n&gt; &gt; wire funds transfer from the &quot;seller&quot;, and report him to the\n&gt; &gt; authorities.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Ideas?\n&gt; \n&gt; Remember that a fraudulent seller if on the way out has no problem \nat\n&gt; all and nothing to lose with dinging you a negative.\n&gt; \n&gt; Even if it is not legit, most people do not look deep enough for \nit to\n&gt; register. \n&gt; \n&gt; I have three negatives on my account, two from people who tried to \nscam\n&gt; me on the buying side, and one because I left a neutral on a \nseller who\n&gt; overclaimed the item he was selling. I got negatived for my \nhonesty.\n&gt; \n&gt; Anyway, the point is that it is not worth it to put yourself into a\n&gt; position to have someone put a negative comment on your feedback.\n&gt; \n&gt; Whomever wins should act sincerely. Petitioning ebay to get a bad\n&gt; feedback item removed is a pain in the rear.\n&gt; \n&gt; The auction will be promptly taken down if reported via the link I\n&gt; sent. I have had someone take pictures of a ring I made and put it \nup on\n&gt; ebay for $13,000.00 and it was taken down after 24 hours.\n&gt; \n&gt; - darcy\n\n\n"
