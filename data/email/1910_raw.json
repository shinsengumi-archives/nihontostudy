I purchased the sword from a WW2 veteran who was \nstationed in Japan during and post surrender. My question is that I \ndon&#39;t know how old the sword is, even though I can see that it&#39;s \nextremely old but I can&#39;t put an exact date on the sword. If anyone \ncan help me with this matter I would be deeply grateful. I uploaded \nclose up pictures of the sword into the folder &quot;Bladeben Katana&quot; in \nthe photo section. The sword is 25.5 inches in total length and the \nblade is 20.5 inches long. Also, if anyone can tell me from the \nshape, hamon pattern etc. who might have made the sword? I ask this \nas the tang is not signed or might have been but lost over time. I \neagerly await any responses.\n\nThanks\nBen (bladeben)  \n\n\n"
