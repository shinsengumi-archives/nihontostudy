Press,  I figure those dealers know something I don&#39;t know about how to gussy a tsuba up.  Just like the guy who photographed his rusty Akasaka tsuba on an orange background, and then sold it to me.  There are special skills and tricks of the trade. \n\n\n----- Original Message ----- \n  From: steven \n  To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Friday, September 24, 2004 1:34 PM\n  Subject: [nihontostudy] Re: Primped/doctored tsuba\n\n\n  Hi Bob,\n\n  Yes, this is a great site... :o).  I have spent quite a bit of time here, \n  and it&#39;s a wealth of information, no doubt.  I think what I&#39;m looking \n  for, though, is to actually see some good close-up photos of a \n  waxed, lacquered, or otherwise primped tsuba.  Sometimes it&#39;s \n  easier to understand when a piece is doctored via visuals than  \n  by desciption only...  Thanks much for the response, Bob.\n\n  Steve\n\n\n  --- In nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Robert Patterson&quot; &lt;\n  b_patt@t...&gt; wrote:\n  &gt; http://home.earthlink.net/~jggilbert/tsuba.htm\n  &gt; \n  &gt; \n  &gt; \n  &gt;   here is a links that gives step by step on cleaning tsuba and \n  loads of \n  &gt; other info  hope it helps     look in the articles section\n  &gt;                                                     Bob\n\n\n        Yahoo!
