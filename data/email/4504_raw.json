Not only are they seen on recent military mounts, but also on bakumatsu period toppei koshirae.  In both cases, the single hanger style of wearing must have presented too many opportunities for the sword to tip out of the saya.\n\nInterestingly, I&#39;ve also seen this on older guards mounted on earlier koshirae, sometimes in Japanese museum collections.  It&#39;s not at all clear if these were swapped-in tsuba, or if spring clip retention was also used at an earlier date for some reason.  Perhaps for particularly unstable swordsmen.\n\nTo show I haven&#39;t (just) been sitting on the beach, a few recent hawk photos for some guy that goes in for that sort of thing:\n\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photo_zoom.gne?id=255912318&size=l\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photo_zoom.gne?id=253671398&size=l\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photo_zoom.gne?id=249338979&size=l\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photo_zoom.gne?id=249387474&size=l\n\nJim\n\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: klepet33319 \n  To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Friday, October 06, 2006 1:30 PM\n  Subject: [nihontostudy] Interesting nakago shape\n\n\n  Would anyone have an idea of why this nakagoana had to be shaped this \n  way?
