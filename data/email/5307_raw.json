Given that it was unsigned and had no unique characteristics, there was no more justification to assign it to a &quot;den&quot; than to assign every dragon or shishi Goto copy to den Goto.   Good workmanship and materials will get a slight point bonus even if the work is not distinctive enough to get a group attribution.  \n\nIn Edo period kinko and also iron sukashi there are many very similar works with signatures from unrelated groups.  Fittings makers were turning out what would sell. \n\nAnd Milt has now burned up all of the time that I have to respond to the list for the immediate future, so you can all thank Milt for that.\n\nJim\n\n\n\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: MuramasaIII@... \n  To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Wednesday, February 27, 2008 9:49 PM\n  Subject: Re: [nihontostudy] Kyo-kinko\n\n\n  sold the Compton&#39;s catalog already so don&#39;t have the lot number anymore.\n  That example is signed.........so if my example is identical to the signed \n  tsuba, the least they can do is give me a &quot; den &quot; ( of the maker&#39;s in Compton&#39;s \n  ).\n  May be not in the shinsa paper, but at least mention it in the yellow point \n  score sheet ( if quality is not there, then how come i get above average \n  points ? )???\n\n  So, I repeat, NO BEER FOR YOU.\n  LOL\n\n\n  milt\n\n  In a message dated 2/27/2008 8:33:26 P.M.
