Akiyama, who died in 1936, was the foremost\nresearcher on tsuba, particularly iron. of his day, and has left a\nlasting impression on the categorization of tsuba to this day. He\ncollected dozens and dozens of oshigata of Nobuiye, some very\nunassuming, as was the found one I refereed to, and they were published\nby a Mr. Nakayama, or Nakamura or something close to that (only my poor\nbrain as a reference here). When you see one like the example you asked\nabout, what makes me suspicious is the &quot;pulled out of the fire&quot; look it\nhas and the lack of depth and sharpness to the chisel work. Those done\nby the Norisuke, I and II, often look quite good, but they must be\nexamined in hand. They often are deficient on the part of the mimi you\ndon&#39;t see from a photograph, as it is said they tended to work from\nbooks that did not illustrate the sides, or that is one story I have\nheard.\n There are many many gimei Owari Nobuiye out there as his work was very\nmuch in vogue during the early 19th Cent. revival period. One the other\nhand there were other, entirely legitimate Nobuiye working elsewhere,\nand they are entirely worthy collectors&#39; pieces in many cases. \n The dealer, that should probably remain confidential to him.\n I hope this helps.\n Arnold\n\n\n\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; matthewhoyle@... 01/31/05 4:41 PM &gt;&gt;&gt;\n\nHi Arnold, thanks for the response. Did you mean the book that these\nscans\ncame from? http://www.jpsword.com/files/kn/nobuiye.html\nThis webpage is very good for making side by side comparisons with the\npix\non Mr. Weissberg&#39;s website. I think I can see the sutble differences in\nthe\nmei now, or perhaps I want to believe I can *grin*. Some more pointers\nin\nthis direction might be good for me all the same. Are there any\nspecifics to\nlook for besides the &#39;softness&#39;?\n\nWith regards to the Akiyama tsuba that was found, the mind boggles how\nit\nwound up on a table at a sword show in the US among a pile of other\ntsuba!\n\nMatt\n\nPs. I know I shouldn&#39;t ask, but who was the lucky finder?\n\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &quot;arnold frenzel&quot; &lt;afrenzel@...&gt;&lt;~!B*+R^&&gt;To:\n&lt;matthewhoyle@...&gt;; &lt;nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com&gt;&lt;~!B*+R^&&gt;Sent:\nMonday, January 31, 2005 7:05 PM\nSubject: Re: [nihontostudy] Gimei Nobuiye?\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi:\n&gt;  At first glance it does look rather nice, however the mei looks\n&gt; tentative, soft and not quite right to me. The first thing one would\n&gt; what to do is to consult the book of Akiyama collected Nobuiye (title\n&gt; escapes me without reference material here) which illustrates the vast\n&gt; bulk of know Nobuiye out there. A few years ago a well known\nCalifornia\n&gt; dealer was lucky enough to find one at a show, bought it and it\n&gt; eventually went Juyo. Sure enough is found among the Akiyama oshigata.\n&gt; You can be quite sure that if such a tsuba left Japan and were correct\n&gt; the price would have at least another zero on the end, and probably an\n&gt; initial digit change as well.\n&gt;  Arnold\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; matthewhoyle@... 01/30/05 5:32 PM &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Gimei Nobuiye?\n&gt;\n&gt; http://www.nihonto.com/11.28.04.html\n&gt;\n&gt; Mr. Weissberg evidently thinks it is gimei, my question is how can you\n&gt; tell?\n&gt; It looks awfully similar to the ones in the books!\n&gt;\n&gt; And if it is indeed gimei, how old is it do we think?\n&gt;\n&gt; Matt\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
