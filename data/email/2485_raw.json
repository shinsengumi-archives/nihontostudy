Anyone know what I&#39;m dealing with here?\n\nSignature looks like Masanori to me. Can someone identify who he is\nexactly? \n\nhttp://www.nihonto.ca/fittings.html\n\nThe material is silver. There is a kao on the tsuba and a signature on\nthe fuchi, and the styles do match. There is a kojiri on this saya as\nwell, along with a fuchi and koiguchi that are all done in the same\nstyle. It&#39;s very nice, all pieces are silver.\n\nAnyone have recommendations about the care and feeding of silver\nfittings (Jim?). I&#39;m guessing leave it alone and don&#39;t touch it.\n\nThe patina on silver is caused unfortunately by sulphur in the air,\nwhich is a product of the industrial revolution. Black Tarnish (silver\nsulfide) is not a native and normal patina for old silver in the days\nwhen it was made... it&#39;s pretty uneven on the tsuba as can be seen, and\nthe kashira is also kind of rough.\n\nI do want to know though if there is a proper care procedure if someone\ndoes know. As well, I&#39;d like to submit this koshirae for papers and\nwant to make sure I&#39;m doing everything right.\n\n- darcy\n\n\n\n"
