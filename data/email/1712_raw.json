I recall seeing these over the years, but\n  never had a term for them until Fuller and Gregory published a couple of\n  pages about them in their first volume on &quot;Imperial swords.&quot; In that book,\n  they say - without reference - that the samurai army raised  against the\n  newly formed Imperial Army  of the Meiji government  by Saigo Takamori was\n  equipped with swords that have a distinctive flat wrap and very ordinary\n  kodogu. Notably, they often have simple washer style menuki.\n        There is no question that these fittings are a &quot;type&quot; that does occur\n  in the real world. By that I mean that it is a fairly consistent style that\n  we do see it from time to time. It looks expedient and very\n  &quot;utility-grade.&quot; But is anyone really aware of evidence that they really\n  were associated with the Satsuma Rebellion? I&#39;m wondering if they might\n  simply be very low-end koshirae produced in terminal Edo/Meiji times for\n  any market there was for low-end swords. If any one has insights on this, I\n  would appreciate them. Thnak you\n        I might as well explain why I ask. I recently acquired some (about\n  140 in all ) 1910 vintage photos of North Pacific ethnographic objects that\n  were being sold by a dealer. A couple of these pictures show Japanese\n  swords and at least one of them certainly looks like a &quot;Rebellion sword.&quot; I\n  know the Rebellion failed, but I have a hard time believing that Saigo left\n  Kyushu for the Aleutians!\n  Peter\n\n\n\n  Peter Bleed\n  Associate Dean\n  College of Arts and Sciences\n  1223 Oldfather Hall\n  University of Nebraska\n  Lincoln, NE 68588-0312\n  (402) 472-2891\n\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  Yahoo!
