Oops, I mean, old sword master.  Hahahaha!\n Yeah, Yumoto&#39;s text is where I likely got the idea, thought I&#39;d\nembellish with all the various English spellings that yield similar\npronunciations.  I have a question re the use of &quot;ae&quot; as in\n&quot;koshirae&quot;.  Should this be pronounced &quot;koh-shee-rah-eh&quot;? I swear I\nhear people say something like &quot;koh-shee-ray&quot;, but I never saw a\nunique pronunciation for the &quot;ae&quot; conjunction such as there is for the\n&quot;ai&quot; and &quot;ei&quot; combinations.  Let me know what you think, Barry, as\nsoon as you sober up enough to focus on the keyboard (try to ignore\nthat splitting headache from overimbibing that crappy Oz wine). \nHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!\n\nNC  ;o)\n\n--- In nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Barry Thomas&quot; &lt;warlord@i...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Chicken - how lovely to see you at work again...\n&gt; \n&gt; I always remember John Yumoto&#39;s simple little pronunciation guide in\nhis &quot;The\n&gt; Samurai Sword - A Handbook&quot;.  It always stood me in good stead. \nBeyond that,\n&gt; Japanese is a nightmare!!!  Thank The Gods that Nihonto is a study\nworth a\n&gt; lifetime&#39;s perseverance...\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; \n&gt; Barry Thomas.\n\n\n\n\n\n"
