Both can have\nhardening/strengthening effects on steel.\n\nMy Kawasaki KLX300 dirtbike (former) has a frame of chromoly, which is\na chromium/molybdenum/iron alloy. From some comments &quot;heat treated\nchromoly steel won&#39;t crack or bend.&quot;\n\nI guess in effect it is no longer steel.\n \n&gt; 3.    - Last but not least he describes Koto blades as being &quot;blue&quot;. Now\n&gt; I have seen a couple and would agree that they do look bluish. Is this\n&gt; why people sometimes call them &quot;wet&quot; ? Also if you had to assign a color\n&gt; to Shinto blades what would it be ?\n\nThis is a stumper for me. I&#39;ve had a great Yukimitsu in my hands, and\ntwo great Shintogo Kunimitsu, and the overall feeling was this kind of\ngrey/white. The color seemed very pure, and these Shintogo were very\ngood and very healthy and the most perfect Nihonto that I&#39;ve seen.\n\nMy feeling at the time (and now) was that it was the kind of thing I\nwould expect to be carried by an angel.\n\nPut side by side with one that seemed filled with various blue colors,\nit was hard to tell the difference.\n\nI wonder if anyone has tried to do some spectral analysis.\n\nSometimes color can be some kind of low-grade oxidation.\n\n- darcy\n\n\n"
