The style of the sukashi design and the ana are typical Saotome.  \n\nBut, the way the surface of the plate is worked and the way the rim is formed look more like Tembo.  The area near the rim on the left side and at the bottom particularly have a Tembo-like punched look to it, even though I don&#39;t see any signs of a figurative pattern in the stamp.  Saotome has a modulated surface, but the working is not quite so deep and hard edged.  You may well have a transition piece.\n\nGenerally if there&#39;s a mix of styles or an intermediate form the attribution tends to go to the later/lesser choice.  Sometimes it&#39;s a toss up as to which label to choose.  The more I look at your piece, the more the Tembo attribution makes sense, despite my initial reaction.\n\nYou mentioned ten-zogan... is it really there?  That&#39;s a bit of a wild card for either type.\n\nIf you can post or send me a copy of the origami I may be able to get some more clues from the attributed date and who the judge or judges were.\n\nAlso, I didn&#39;t take the time to hit the books on this one.  Have you found published pieces with that kind of plate and rim attributed to Saotome?  I&#39;d like to hear other opinions.\nJim\n\n\n  I recently acquired the following tsuba.\n\n  http://gcclearn.gcc.vccs.edu/stein/tembo2.jpg\n\n  It is 84 cm and is papered to Tempo by the NTHK.\n\n  My question - why tembo and not Saotome? The are\n  no stamps on the plate only sukashi and possibly\n  a few brass ten-zogan. The style of plate, sukashi,\n  etc. to me say Saotome. Recognizing that Tembo is\n  an outgrowth of Saotome, I still don&#39;t see why this\n  was papered to Tembo instead of Saotome. Any thoughts\n  appreciated.\n\n  Thanks\n  Rich S\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
