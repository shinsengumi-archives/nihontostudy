Still fallout from the real estate bubble I suppose.\n&gt; In Canada now, back to start a new season onboard my ship in a week. Thanks\n&gt; for having a look-see. I am trying to match a koshirae for my Nosada. It is\n&gt; here, http://www.johnstuart.biz/new_page_14.htm  to show what I am going\n&gt; for. Of course if anyone else reading this knows of one for sale that would\n&gt; be suitable, please rattle my cage. Ron, I completely forgot about the KTK\n&gt; book and will remedy that soon, after all I have all the others and they\n&gt; always have had something to tickle my fancy.

Did you ever get my response to you on the 2009 KTK book? Never\n&gt;&gt; heard back from you on that. Are you back in Japan?

Do you\n&gt;&gt; by any chance have a Mino-bori kogai that is cluttering up the drawer?\n&gt;&gt; Anyone else? Of good good to very good quality. It is true that once this\n&gt;&gt; site and others had a lot of traffic. Learned a lot over time here.
