In an\n &gt; amusing=\r\n scroll, a 17th century samurai impresses passing women by\n &gt; showing off t=\r\nhe hawk perched on his sleeve while Mount Fuji towers\n &gt; in the background.=\r\n\n &gt;=86\n &gt;=86=86=86=86=86 Three centuries later, presidential candidates pos=\r\nture as\n &gt; regular guys by duck hunting or attending NASCAR.\n &gt;=86\n &gt;=86=86=\r\n=86=86=86 The exhibit&#39;s several large folding screens on the subject of\n &gt; =\r\nfalconry combine revelatory beauty with subtle social observation.\n &gt;=86\n &gt;=\r\n=86=86=86=86=86 The samurai&#39;s powerful identification with the solitary\nhun=\r\nters\n &gt; becomes obvious.\n &gt;=86\n &gt;=86=86=86=86=86 In a 17th century six-pane=\r\nl folding screen, &quot;Hawk Eagle in a\n &gt; Pine Tree,&quot; the winged subject&#39;s glin=\r\nting eye and curved beak,\n &gt; captured in remarkable detail with ink on pape=\r\nr, stare down on\n &gt; viewers, conveying an impression of unquestionable auth=\r\nority.\n &gt;=86\n &gt;=86=86=86=86=86 &quot;Samurai used falconry as a way to reinforce=\r\n their position as\n &gt; the dominant political force,&quot; Morse said.\n &gt;=86\n &gt;=\r\n=86=86=86=86=86 One can only wonder whether ordinary citizens regarded\nsamu=\r\nrai,\n &gt; like the winged hunters they admired, as merciless exemplars of\n &gt; =\r\nnatural law. Rather than focus exclusively on falcons, the exhibit\n &gt; inclu=\r\ndes art featuring eagles, goshawks and other hunting birds to\n &gt; examine th=\r\ne changing roles samurai played in Japanese society.\n &gt;=86\n &gt;=86=86=86=86=\r\n=86 The word &quot;samurai&quot; means &quot;those who serve&quot; and originally\n &gt; referred t=\r\no a military caste that adhered to a strict code of\n &gt; loyalty, courage and=\r\n cultivation of traditional arts.\n &gt;=86\n &gt;=86=86=86=86=86 Starting around t=\r\nhe 12th century, samurai served large\n &gt; landowners called daimyos. After t=\r\nhe feudal system was abolished in\n &gt; 1869 and Japan was united under a mili=\r\ntary leader or shogun,\nsamurai\n &gt; were reduced to ceremonial roles as remin=\r\nders of a heroic past.\n &gt;=86\n &gt;=86=86=86=86=86 The samurai&#39;s changing role =\r\nfrom fighters to highly regarded\n &gt; civil servants can be seen through the =\r\nevolution of their body\narmor\n &gt; from purely functional equipment to largel=\r\ny ceremonial suits.\n &gt;=86\n &gt;=86=86=86=86=86 Once samurai had no more wars t=\r\no fight, Morse said, they used\n &gt; rituals and art associated with falconry =\r\nto cultivate an image of\n &gt; refined strength.\n &gt;=86\n &gt;=86=86=86=86=86 As wa=\r\nr became a thing of the past, Morse said extended falcon\n &gt; hunts became bo=\r\nth &quot;outlets&quot; for martial energy and ceremonies that\n &gt; confirmed loyalty an=\r\nd status.\n &gt;=86\n &gt;=86=86=86=86=86 A finely wrought fan is decorated with a =\r\nscene of a royal hunt\n &gt; from the classic novel &quot;The Tale of the Genji&quot; by =\r\nLady Murasaki. A\n &gt; fabulously detailed horizontal painting, &quot;Horse Racing =\r\nat Kato\n &gt; Shrine,&quot; depicts several levels of Japanese life with the subdue=\r\nd\n &gt; complexity reminiscent of Flemish master Pieter Bruegel.\n &gt;=86\n &gt;=86=\r\n=86=86=86=86 The exhibit reveals Japan&#39;s ability to absorb and refine\n &gt; ac=\r\ntivities and art borrowed from Asian neighbors.\n &gt;=86\n &gt;=86=86=86=86=86 Acc=\r\nording to the informative wall , falconry came to Japan\nfrom\n &gt; Korea in th=\r\ne sixth century. Chinese scroll painting was adapted by\n &gt; Japanese artists=\r\n who changed the proportions to suit homes where\n &gt; people sat on floor mat=\r\ns rather than chairs.\n &gt;=86\n &gt;=86=86=86=86=86 Morse observed both exhibits =\r\nrecord the samurai&#39;s changing\n &gt; world in times of relative peace when they=\r\n used valued objects like\n &gt; swords and hunting birds to assert the status =\r\ntheir forebears\nearned\n &gt; during the brutal civil wars of the past.\n &gt;=86\n =\r\n&gt;=86=86=86=86=86 After social reforms restricted falconry to the imperial\nf=\r\namily\n &gt; in the late 19th century, great hunting birds remained potent\n &gt; s=\r\nymbols in new art forms.\n &gt;=86\n &gt;=86=86=86=86=86 The exhibit includes a str=\r\niking sculpted bronze eagle with a\n &gt; silver patina given to the emperor in=\r\n 1917.\n &gt;=86\n &gt;=86=86=86=86=86 Over time, images of hunting birds that once=\r\n adorned samurai\n &gt; armor were used to decorate gowns worn by merchants and=\r\n courtesans.\n &gt;=86\n &gt;=86=86=86=86=86 At its best, &quot;Pursuits of Power&quot; provi=\r\ndes aesthetic thrills\nand\n &gt; historical insights.\n &gt;=86\n &gt;=86=86=86=86=86 T=\r\nhe gold-dappled, six-panel folding screen &quot;Goshawk Mews&quot;\n &gt; reveals the spl=\r\nendor of imperial Japan. At the height of the Edo\n &gt; period, a yellow-eyed =\r\nhawk soars down upon a raccoon. In a charming\n &gt; 19th century woodblock pri=\r\nnt, a child cries when his hawk-shaped\n &gt; kite becomes entangled in a tree.=\r\n\n &gt;=86\n &gt;=86=86=86=86=86 One of Japan&#39;s greatest warriors, Tokugawa Ieyasu,=\r\n said &quot;a\ntrue\n &gt; samurai must do more than act courageously in the heat of =\r\nthe\n &gt; moment.
