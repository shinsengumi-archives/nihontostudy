Recently I had an online \ndiscuss=\r\nion about Mito Tsuba. This tsuba&#39;s image was sent to me as an \nexample of M=\r\nito. Apparently there is some discussion going on about \nit&#39;s age. Mr Rober=\r\nt Haynes has put back the date by 100 years. That \nisn&#39;t what I wonder abou=\r\nt. It is the patina and colour. Has anyone \nseen this type of patina before=\r\n?
