Shipping cost 30. zlotys. Total: 107.50\nzlotys.\n&gt; The zloty is trading today in the 3.85 to 3.90 to the dollar range.\n&gt; That comes out to something like $28, which is heck of a deal a 232 pp,\n&gt; quarto, color book.  The text is in Polish, of course, but all the\ntechnical\n&gt; terms are the Japanese terms everyone is accustomed to.  There are 100\nvery\n&gt; nicely full page photographed tsuba, including some very nice examples.\n&gt;\n&gt; This book site work just like Amazon, but is all in Polish.  Search on\n&gt; &quot;tsuba,&quot; and you&#39;ll find the book.  It is fairly easy to order.  The only\n&gt; tricky part is fitting US addresses into spaces designed for\n&gt; Polish-formatted addresses.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; nihontostudy-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
