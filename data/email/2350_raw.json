It may have had a rough life or it may be the result of artificial aging.  The delaminated blister at the lower right has rather sharp edges.  \n\nThere are a couple of famous examples of this type with a 5 stupa design preserved in shrines, one of which is Juyo Bunkazai.  The execution of this one is more naive.  If it&#39;s legitimate it would be Muromachi period and would probably be attributed to katchushi.  The main point of shinsa would be to find out if it really is legit.  Reproduction katchushi and tosho guards were made from at least the Meiji period through the present day. \nJim\n  Hi Tom and Rich,\n\n  Thanks for the opinions... consensus is that it is an old and good piece then?\n\n  Iron tsuba make my head spin. She just sent me the scan and asked me to tell her\n  what it was, and I have no idea so I sent to the list.\n\n  If anyone else out there has opinions on age and if it should be submitted to\n  papers, I would like to know. My friend inherited a collection of tsuba at one\n  time so these mystery pieces pop up every now and then.\n\n  - darcy\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
