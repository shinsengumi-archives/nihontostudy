The style of the sukashi is more like Kyo work, \n  though.  It&#39;s difficult to judge iron from photographs, but it \n  doesn&#39;t look typically Owari.  I&#39;ve seen guards that looked quite \n  like Owari be judged as Shoami because of uncertainty over the lack \n  of some classic characteristic or other.  Some of these sukashi \n  pieces can be very difficult to pigeonhole with confidence because \n  they share characteristics of Kyo and Owari.  My guess is that your \n  guard would be attributed to Shoami.  Probably early Edo period or a \n  bit older.\n  &gt; \n  &gt;   The other guard is interesting.  Some of that type have plates \n  like Kamakura bori and have a simple carving around the rim.  Others \n  have plates more like Onin guards.  Both types can have a simple \n  ring or two of brass inlay.  I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve seen an example that \n  has the rim hammered like yours, but aesthetically it seems like the \n  same idea as the carved decoration seen on others.\n  &gt; \n  &gt;   The style of the plate, the shape of the kozuka ana and the \n  simple inlay decoration would all point to an Onin attribution.    \n  How thick is it?  Probably mid Muromachi at least.\n  &gt; \n  &gt;   Jim\n  &gt; \n  &gt; \n  &gt;     Gentlemen:\n  &gt; \n  &gt;     I really have problems with attribution on these early tsuba:\n  &gt;     http://www.nihontophile.com/Suk1.jpg\n  &gt;     http://www.nihontophile.com/Suk2.jpg\n  &gt;     http://www.nihontophile.com/Suk3.jpg\n  &gt;     Tsuba is 7.2 tall x 6.9 cm wide; 4 mm thick at the mimi.\n  &gt;     I first thought Ko-Shoami because of the fine sukashi work.\n  &gt;     But it looks Owari (and has bones in the rim). However it is \n  on the \n  &gt;     small side..which would place it late but it looks early and \n  has \n  &gt;     obviously been mounted many times.\n  &gt;     What about Kyo-Shoami?\n  &gt;     (perhaps some day I will get it down.....:)\n  &gt; \n  &gt;     Also this tsuba has given me a fit as to attribution/age:\n  &gt;     http://www.nihontophile.com/html/gallery.html\n  &gt; \n  &gt;     Any help would be much appreciated.\n  &gt; \n  &gt;     Kind regards,\n  &gt;     Ron P.\n  &gt; \n  &gt; \n  &gt; \n  &gt; \n  &gt;           Yahoo!
