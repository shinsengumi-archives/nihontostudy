The iron parrying bars would have taken care of other blades.  =\r\nI don&#39;t recall anything about the leather plate that would suggest that it =\r\nwasn&#39;t contemporary with the rest of the mounting, but my memory of it isn&#39;=\r\nt good enough to base an argument on.  There is a somewhat similar koshirae=\r\n at the bottom of page 82 of Bottomley and Hopson&#39;s &quot;Arms and Armor of the =\r\nSamurai.&quot;  Scanned here for your convenience:\n  http://tinyurl.com/dd82\n\n  =\r\nI suppose it&#39;s possible that someone transplanted a shinai tsuba onto the n=\r\nagamaki koshirae.  But on the other hand if you set out to make a round lea=\r\nther guard to go on a round wooden stick, I&#39;m not sure how one for a nagama=\r\nki pole would or should look different from one for a shinai.  Any ideas?\n\n=\r\n  If we were talking about a loose guard not associated with a koshirae, I&#39;=\r\nd agree with Mo that it&#39;s much more likely to have been from a shinai or bo=\r\nkken than a nagamaki.  But this one did come on a nagamaki and we have othe=\r\nr examples of pole arms mounted like this with a hand guard on the pole and=\r\n parrying bars either mounted on the nakago or on the pole.  Am I missing s=\r\nomething?\n  Jim \n\n  --\n\n\n    &lt;http://tinyurl.com/d2ee&gt;http://tinyurl.com/d2=\r\nee\n\n    Jim-\n          I just got around to looking at this. Check the size=\r\n of that \n    hole dude!=DD Are you sure this is original to the pole? This=\r\n looks \n    like a kendo shinai tsuba, a very old one but I would bet it is=\r\n for a \n    shinai none the less.\n    Tom\n\n\n  [Non-text portions of this me=\r\nssage have been removed]\n\n\n        Yahoo!
