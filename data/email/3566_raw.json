We have had more time \nt=\r\no find more manuscripts and books, scrolls or whatever. Also, Some of \nthes=\r\ne scholars of ye olden times may not have had access to books on the \nother=\r\n side of the country ( just speculation ) I don&#39;t know about that \nbut it w=\r\nould be plausible I think. As time goes on, we acquire more \ninformation an=\r\nd learn more and more. I am sure the printing press and \nthen the Internet =\r\nhave made massive advances in the acquisition of \nknowledge.\n\nSo, to clarif=\r\ny,  I am not dismissing this and suggesting it is of little \nworth because =\r\nit&#39;s old. The line of thought was that it is more likely \nthat this is a co=\r\npy, and one has to question it&#39;s accuracy ( your \noriginal question ).  As =\r\nI said in my last post. I think these types of \nbooks, the originals, would=\r\n be locked away and under key.\n\nI am working and typing, I could never mana=\r\nge two things at once LOL. \nSorry if my thoughts are confusing.\n\nRich\n\n\n\n\nR=\r\nichard Turner\nNihont=F4 Message Board\n&lt;http://www.nihontomessageboard.com/n=\r\nmb&gt;\n- /for the discussion and sharing of all things Nihont=F4/\n\n \n\n\n\nbungot=\r\nakadasword wrote:\n\n&gt;Trickie und all,\n&gt;I don&#39;t know but we have to assume &quot; =\r\nmodan &quot; knowledge has to start \n&gt;somewhere in the past...........they just =\r\ndon&#39;t spring up overnight.\n&gt;&gt;From the few pics, I see it shows the number o=\r\nf strokes with the dragon \n&gt;thingie, inverted double 8 ( v) etc.\n&gt;\n&gt;Like we=\r\n wouldn&#39;t just dismiss Newton&#39;s Principia Mathematica just \n&gt;because it&#39;s &quot;=\r\n old &quot;......you think ?\n&gt;\n&gt;Milt\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this me=\r\nssage have been removed]\n\n\n"
