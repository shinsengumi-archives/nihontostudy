Sorry it has taken so long to get back to you.    I have  \nfound the copy of the letter as well as the book inscribed to Dr  \nCompton.   I am still looking for a note that I found in another  \nbook.   It is some scribbling about a sword that I assume that BW  \nRobinson was studying.    If you don&#39;t mind, I will look a little  \nmore for that.   If I don&#39;t find it, then I will just send these.    \nIf you are pressed for time, I can send you these and whenever I run  \nacross the other again try to find your address and send it.    \nCHeers, Bob\nOn Feb 19, 2009, at 5:11 PM, excelsiorilluminati wrote:\n\n&gt; Hi Bob, may I get photos of the letter and inscription in the book or\n&gt; scan?

One is a copy of his\n&gt; book signed with a inscription\n&gt; &gt; when he gave it to Dr Compton - very cool, but not much information\n&gt; content, just a\n&gt; &gt; reference to happy sword collecting. The other is a letter from\n&gt; Robinson (who had amazing\n&gt; &gt; penmanship) to the owner of a sword that I now own describing at\n&gt; length who made the\n&gt; &gt; sword, where it was made etc. Let me know if this would be of any\n&gt; interest.

I have been asked if\n&gt; there are\n&gt; &gt; &gt; other sources of original (in facsimile) material and\n&gt; documentation\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that could be made available to supplement these letters.
