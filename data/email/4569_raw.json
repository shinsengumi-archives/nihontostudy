However they have\n&gt; this 17th Akasaka tsuba pictured that has a=\r\n gold\n&gt; inlay.  I didn&#39;t think that akasaka worked with\n&gt; inlays?  Is this =\r\njust uncommon or wrong?\n&gt; http://www.beloit.edu/~museum/wrightonline/exhibi=\r\nt6/e60012a.htm\n&gt; \n&gt; Site is worth going through, some nice pieces,\n&gt; begini=\r\nng of tsuba section:\n&gt; http://www.beloit.edu/~museum/wrightonline/exhibit6/=\r\ne60001a.htm\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks\n&gt; Ken &quot;the mantis dude&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; ______________________=\r\n____________________________\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?\n&gt; Tired of spam?
