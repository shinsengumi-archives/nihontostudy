To kill for.  I understand that Natsuo was so \nhighly regarded in his own time that he was commissioned to design \nthe silver one sen piece in the early 1900s.  Unfortunately, this \ndesign was, in my opinion, kinda ho-hum traditional (typical curling \ndragon) and not in the same ballpark as the referenced menuki.  I&#39;m \nstill trying to find a cheep! cheep! cheep! copy of the book on \nNatsuo (was advertised somewhere a few months back at $300, not \nexactly chicken feed).\n\nNC\n\n\n"
