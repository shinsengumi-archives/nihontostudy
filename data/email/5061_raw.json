I have been \n&gt;wondering for some time now why there were transitions in size of \n&gt;tsuba during the Nanbokucho to Momoyama Jidai and would like to know \n&gt;if one of the members could help pull this together for me.  It seems \n&gt;to make sense that shorter one-hand use swords would require smaller \n&gt;tsuba and I believe that this would explain some of the smaller tsuba \n&gt;such as some Kanayama pieces one finds during the Muromachi and \n&gt;Momoyama.  It&#39;s just bothered me that we start with very large Tosho \n&gt;pieces then see much smaller ones, then move to larger sukashi ones \n&gt;as we move through the warring states period.  Any help much \n&gt;appreciated.\n&gt;\n&gt;&quot;Historically, the emergence of the usage of the term &quot;wakizashi&quot; to \n&gt;refer to &quot;an established category of swords within a specific range \n&gt;of length (measured by the distance between the ha-machi and the \n&gt;kissaki)&quot; that were commonly and officially (after the Tokugawa \n&gt;Shogunate had issued an executive order) worn by the samurai is \n&gt;relatively a new phenomenon. In fact, it was only after the beginning \n&gt;of the shin-to period, thus mainly post-Muromachi and especially Edo \n&gt;period. Prior to this, that is when the samurai&#39;s &quot;main sword&quot; had \n&gt;been a tachi (i.e, ko-to, thus pre-Muromachi period), they most often \n&gt;used to &quot;wear&quot; different types of &quot;side/peripheral swords such \n&gt;as &quot;yoroi-doshi&quot; (by inserting between obi), &quot;chiisa-gatana&quot; (by \n&gt;inserting between obi) and &quot;koshi-gatana&quot; (by mostly inserting \n&gt;between obi, but sometimes hanging it from obi) (Ogasawara, 1994b).\n&gt;[Note. For the academic and historical classification of &quot;chisa-\n&gt;gatana,&quot; and its relations to &quot;koshi-gatana&quot; and &quot;tanto,&quot; see \n&gt;Ogasawara, 1994a and 1994b.]&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;Yahoo!
