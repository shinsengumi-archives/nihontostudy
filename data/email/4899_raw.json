In order words, you\nmust be able to justify th=\r\ne force you used. If burglar enters your home and\nyou surprise him (or her =\r\nin a politically correct world) with sword in hand\nand burglar flees...your=\r\n done, the defence is complete. If, while burglar is\nin the process of gett=\r\ning his/her=A0butt out of your house you use your latest\niaido move to slic=\r\ne a pound of flesh off, you are in serious s**t.\nAlternately, if burglar is=\r\n armed and means to kill you for your meager\nbelongings and you use your be=\r\nst iaido move to slice a pound of flesh off,\nthen it becomes your word agai=\r\nnst his/hers. The most important\nstatement...you have to justify the force =\r\nyou used. The weapon you use is\nirrelevant. You will have to explain why yo=\r\nu used what you did and justify\nit to satisfy a judge in court. THEN...ther=\r\ne&#39;s the whole civil side of the\nlaw. If, as a result of the pound of flesh =\r\nyou sliced off, burglar can no\nlonger function in society, can&#39;t hold a job=\r\n and support him or herself\n(even if that job is burglary) you might get yo=\r\nur=A0butt sued and will have to\nsupport said burglar for a long time.
