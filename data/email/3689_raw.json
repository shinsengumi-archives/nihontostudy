The mountings look interesting with Higo style fuchi and kashira, nice shakudo menuki that look possibly early, nice tsuba. The blade seems to have a nice shape and the kissaki being extended makes me think possibly sue-koto possibly. The hamon as was mentioned, seems a chu-suguha. I just wonder if this could be a sue-koto Bungo blade, a wild guess considering its condition but I&#39;ll say that anyway. Hope you end up with it.\n\nRon\nSTL\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: Patrik Danielsson \n  To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Sunday, January 08, 2006 11:14 AM\n  Subject: [nihontostudy] need some advices on a sword...\n\n\n  Hello to you all, i  was offered this sword, would like some feedback about it from you all,the seller dont want to take the tsuka off it, at this moment.
