As long as the 1/3 of one side is not too severely damaged and everything else about the guard is good, I think it would pass, however the point level would be significantly lower than for the same guard in overall good condition.  If the rust is bad and/or the guard is only ordinary quality, you might be looking at a shinteisho level paper (60-69 points).  If it was a much better than average tsuba and the rust isn&#39;t too bad, a kanteisho might be possible.  It depends on just what levels of quality and condition you have.\n\nJim\n\n\n\n  gang,\n  we all know the NTHK und NBTHK have &quot; different &quot; policy in pinkie\n  submitted items.\n\n  NTHK is more &quot; hang up &quot; on condition, ja ?\n\n  Assuming I have a tsuba made by a good maker ( not gimei ) ,\n  condition is good on the omote side ( where the mei is ) but the ura\n  side has rust damage ( 1/3 area ).\n  What&#39;s the chance it will pass/get pinkied ?\n\n  Milt\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
