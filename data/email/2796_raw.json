Any help/suggestions re \n&gt; either of these requests would be much appreciated.\n&gt; \n&gt; While you are in my Photo Album, I am still seeking some information \n&gt; on the gold, hira-zogan seal.

Hello, The gold seal \nseems to be a province name, Bishu (Owari not Bizen) perhaps. These \ntype of scripts make things difficult and I can&#39;t figure out the \nenamel mei on the tsuba. The style seems to be Katchushi, J.\n\n\n\n\n"
