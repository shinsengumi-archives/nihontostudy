Having read the Koza entry, Haynes Index,\nTorigoye, and a few other references- there seems to\nbe a lot of confusion.\n\nHaynes Index indicates the relationship between the\nKunitomo tsuba vs those signed Hazama is unclear. The\nKoza has the founder being Kunitomo Mura &lt;?&gt; (no\nclarification or mention of whether he ever signed)\nand then Kunitomo Teihei (aka Sadashige) moving to\nKameyama and working.\n\nSome texts state the Hazama came first, then the\nKunitomo. Other seem to have it the other way around.\nAnyone able to share the current thought on these\ngroups. Are they one and the same, or two doing\nsimilar work?\n   What is the standing and relation of Teiei\n(Sadashige) to those signed Hazama? Should he be\nconsidered the founder of a Kameyama subgroup of the\nKunitomo? His work seems the most primitive of the 4\ntsuba, but then he and the other Kunitomo tsuba are\nworking in iron while the Hazama are in much softer\ncopper. \n\nAny help much appreciated!\n\nCurran\n\n\n\n \n____________________________________________________________________________________\nIt&#39;s here!
