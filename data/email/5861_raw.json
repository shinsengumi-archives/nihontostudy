I have seen many swords with Muromac=\r\nhi/Momoyama style\n&gt; koshirae over the years, but 99.9% have been 19th c. sw=\r\nords in retro style.\n&gt;\n&gt; Two exceptions come to mind: Victor Harris and I c=\r\natalogued the blades in\n&gt; the Museum of Japanese Sword Fittings in Tokyo fo=\r\nr Christie&#39;s in &#39;05. In\n&gt; that collection was a Momoyama tachi koshirae tha=\r\nt was later sold in NY,\n&gt; the\n&gt; other was an itomaki tachi made for an Iked=\r\na Daimyo in Christie&#39;s London.\n&gt; Victor has seen this nagamaki and agrees t=\r\nhat it is 16th c.\n&gt;\n&gt; I think this weapon is the first of a number of ident=\r\nical contract pieces\n&gt; for an armoury, as it is numbered &#39;1&#39; as are one sep=\r\npa, the fuchi and the\n&gt; tsuka in ink under the fuchi, it is utilitarian, wi=\r\nth thin yamagane mounts\n&gt; and low quality lacquer, the nakago-ana are not w=\r\nell made. The long ububa\n&gt; can be accounted for by its lack of use, it may =\r\nhave been polished only\n&gt; once\n&gt; or twice then stored for a very long time,=\r\n this would account for its\n&gt; fairly\n&gt; good condition apart from the leathe=\r\nr tsuka binding shrinking and being\n&gt; attacked by insects.\n&gt;\n&gt; It may look =\r\nlike a sword but it has the thick saya of a polearm, no\n&gt; kurikata\n&gt; and th=\r\ne tsuka is 21.5&quot; long.\n&gt;\n&gt; As I stated in my earlier post it weighs around =\r\n6lbs, this is not something\n&gt;\n&gt; one would want as a personal weapon, it is =\r\ntoo heavy and awkward to carry\n&gt; and I think would only be useful in battle=\r\n.\n&gt;\n&gt; --\n&gt; I am using the free version of SPAMfighter.\n&gt; We are a community=\r\n of 7 million users fighting spam.\n&gt; SPAMfighter has removed 9 of my spam e=\r\nmails to date.\n&gt; Get the free SPAMfighter here: http://www.spamfighter.com/=\r\nlen\n&gt;\n&gt; The Professional version does not have this message\n&gt;\n&gt; [Non-text p=\r\nortions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\n\n\n-- \n*\n*\n*\n*\n*Think of=\r\n the poorest person you have ever seen and ask if your next act\nwill be of =\r\nany use to him. -Mahatma Gandhi (1869-1948)*\n*\n*\n*If we could read the secr=\r\net history of our enemies, we should find in each\nman&#39;s life sorrow and suf=\r\nfering enough to disarm all hostility. -Henry\nWadsworth Longfellow, poet (1=\r\n807-1882) *\n*\n*\n*What do we live for, if it is not to make life less diffic=\r\nult for each\nother? -George Eliot (Mary Ann Evans), novelist (1819-1880)*\n\n=\r\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
