(BTW, there are only a few known guards signed by Tadamune by the 4th gen.)\n\nThe shodai seems to show more Owari influence than Kyo, but that is open to argument and I think that both influences are present.\n\nThe tsuba in the photo looks later than the nidai to me, but the design has some early elements.\nJim\n\np.s.\nSometimes I hear Ko-Akasaka used to describe tsuba with Akasaka-style motifs that otherwise appear to predate the Edo period, i.e. &quot;proto-Akasaka.&quot;  I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve seen this usage in any Japanese sources though.\n\n\n\n  All, am I right in thinking that Ko Akasaka is referring to old Akasaka \n  as in, the Shodai, Nidai and maybe, though I am not convinced, the \n  Sandai. But the first of the Akasaka smiths ( the oldest ) that had \n  heavy influence from Kyo sukashi and Owari works. Am I right in this \n  thinking ?.\n\n  and while were at it, this looks like the work of the Nidai Tadamasa or \n  a student there off, any comment&#39;s\n  http://www.image-hosting.net/images/messageboard/retalt/akasaka.jpg\n\n  Cheers and happy new year to you all.\n\n  Rich Turner\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
