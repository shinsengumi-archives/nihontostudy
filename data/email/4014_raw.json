I f=\r\norgot to mention the dimensions again, so for the record they are 90.1 mm H=\r\n x 84.1 mm W x 5.0 - 5.5 mm thick at the mimi.\n\nThe maker is Nobuie and the=\r\n signature is of the type now called futoji-mei =E5=A4=AA=E5=AD=97=E9=8A=98=\r\n (bold, thick).  Within both the hanare and futoji-mei types there is consi=\r\nderable variation in the detail of the signatures.  This example is not one=\r\n of the more boldly executed futoji-mei.  As Pete crypictically indicated, =\r\nan oshigata of this guard is published in Nakamura Kakudayu and Akiyama Kyu=\r\nsaku&#39;s 1926 Nobuie Tsuba shu (#52).  There the signature is described as su=\r\nmari-mei =E8=A9=B0=E3=82=8A=E9=8A=98 (&quot;close packed&quot;), which is one of the =\r\nolder terms now included within the futoji-mei type.  This guard is describ=\r\ned as futoji-mei in several later books and in the NBTHK&#39;s attribution.\n\nTh=\r\ne hitsuana had not yet been filled when the oshigata was made.  This guard =\r\nwas the property of the Okubo daimyo family in Odawara until it was sold in=\r\n 1931, so the ana were likely filled by the new owner.  It is unlikely that=\r\n they are original to the plate given that they are made such that the guar=\r\nd would be mounted with the unsigned side as the front.  The shapes of the =\r\nhitsuana are unusual.   It was clearly mounted with an o-kozuka, which are =\r\ntypically 18-20 mm wide (vs. the standard size of 14-15 mm).  As Gordon men=\r\ntioned, the small size of the kogai-ana suggests it was mounted with one of=\r\n the narrow style ko-Mino kogai.  The opening is too small to accommodate a=\r\n standard 14-15 mm wide kogai.\n\nThe early Edo period &quot;betsujin&quot; (different =\r\nperson) Nobuie work will lack the quality in the metal, tekkotsu, finish an=\r\nd carving.  The plates are usually rather characterless and the working lac=\r\nks subtlety.  The late Edo period revival pieces do indeed try to emulate t=\r\nhe finish of the originals and as Alan mentioned some do a fairly good job.=\r\n  In general, the working of the rim is a bit forced and overdone in these =\r\nexamples compared to the originals.  They obviously will look young, but th=\r\nere is also a somewhat artificial quality to them.  The same feeling comes =\r\nfrom later copies of early Shino and Oribe ceramics.\n\nThe metal, tekkotsu a=\r\nnd yakite finish should lead to an Owari origin.  Remember that Kaneie work=\r\ned in Kyoto, and everything about his guards is in line with Kyoto methods =\r\nand aesthetics.\n\nThat&#39;s all I can think of at the moment.\n\nJim  \n\n\n\n  The p=\r\nhotos for kantei problem number three can be viewed here:\n\n  http://ph.grou=\r\nps.yahoo.com/group/nihontostudy/photos/browse/3108\n\n  Jim\n\n\n[Non-text porti=\r\nons of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
