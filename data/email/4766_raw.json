The only feature that may be considered common t=\r\no \nthem both is some evidence of a Chinese influence.  However, while \nwith=\r\n Namban tsuba this resulted in a completely novel metalworking \ntechnique, =\r\nSoten tsuba use conventional, Japanese techniques to \nillustrate historical=\r\n sujects which may be of Chinese derivation.  \nBut there a lots of differen=\r\nces:-\n\nSoten tsuba came initially from a recognised &#39;school&#39; of makers, \nal=\r\nthough they were later mass produced outside this.  There was never \na reco=\r\ngnised Namban &#39;school&#39;, the namban influence being ubiquitous.\n\nNamban tsub=\r\na had their origin in China, were imported into Japan at \nthe end of the C1=\r\n6, and reached the peak of their popularity in the \nlate C18.  Soten tsuba =\r\ndate from the early C18 and continued to be \nmade, as poor quality shiiremo=\r\nno, into the late Edo period.  \n(Although I have no evidence for this, I su=\r\nspect that many of the \nlatter may also have been produced using the &#39;lost =\r\nwax&#39; method of \ncasting.)\n\nTrue examples of the Namban group are characteri=\r\nsed by extensive \nopenwork and undercutting, whereas with Soten tsuba, whil=\r\ne they may \ndemonstrate some degree of openwork, this is not a constant fea=\r\nture \nand never includes undercutting.\n\nNamban tsuba commonly have profuse =\r\ngold decoration, either as nunome-\nzogan or fire gilding.  Soten tsuba are =\r\ncharacterised by selective \nand delicate inlays of gold, silver, copper and=\r\n shakudo.\n\nSoten tsuba do not demonstrate the decorartive mimi, seppa-dai a=\r\nnd \nryo-hitsu which characterise Namban tsuba.  Signatures, although \nadmit=\r\ntedly usually gimei, feature frequently on Soten tsuba and \nalmost never in=\r\n the Namban group.\n\nThe design on Soten tsuba is themed, being is represent=\r\native of \nspecific characters or incidents, while that on Namban tsuba is \n=\r\npurely decorative. \n\nNo, I personally know of no relationship between the t=\r\nwo groups.\n\nRegards, John L.\n\n\n--- In nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Elliot=\r\nt&quot; &lt;elliott@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; First, I appreciate all the comments that were =\r\nmade in reference to \nmy \n&gt; question about &#39;cast&#39; tsuba. And all the discus=\r\nsion about Namban \nleads \n&gt; me to my next question for the group......\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n What is the relationship between Nanban Tsuba and Soten Tsuba? \n&gt; \n&gt; Thank=\r\ns,\n&gt; \n&gt; Elliott\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"
