I had given up on the thread attracting any\n  reply. Is there any way to estimate a period on menuki like this, or\n  are they usually just lumped into the &quot;late edo&quot; period?\n  I haven&#39;t seen a lot of info on menuki anywhere. Are there any\n  (English) books with a decent chapter on menuki at all, and what are\n  the things to look out for in early menuki?\n\n  Regards,\n  Brian\n\n  --- In nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Jim Gilbert&quot; &lt;jggilbert@E...&gt; wrote:\n  &gt; Brian,\n  &gt; They&#39;re not Goto, although they are following the style.  I don&#39;t\n  think that it is possible to attribute them to a specific group.  At\n  shinsa work like this is often described as Kyo-Kanagushi (Kyoto metal\n  fittings maker). \n  &gt; \n  &gt; Jim\n  &gt; \n  &gt; \n  &gt; \n  &gt;   Hi all,\n  &gt;   I recently made an offer on a set of menuki on eBay, and got them. I&#39;m\n  &gt;   not a fittings guy at all, but wanted a nice pair for a future\n  &gt;   mounting project, and as an example for study.\n  &gt;   They were described as Goto or at least waki-goto. I doubt they are \n  &gt;   Goto...but am wondering if anyone has any thoughts on the quality,\n  &gt;   school etc? Are there any identifying marks on menuki that might lead\n  &gt;   towards a certain school?\n  &gt;   Was really attracted to them because of the fine carving work, and\n  &gt;   detail. The colour is a nice dark brownish-black shakudo, not like the\n  &gt;   lighting in the photo shows.\n  &gt;   They are actually nicer than in the pics..with some very fine carving,\n  &gt;   and detail on the toes, ribs, tail etc. Some odd marks on the\n  &gt;   legs..which are 2 ovals with a small dot in the middle.\n  &gt;   Middle to late edo I assume? Condition is very good. Any comments from\n  &gt;   &quot;menuki guys&quot; appreciated.\n  &gt; \n  &gt;   Pic is at\n  &gt;   http://www.image-hosting.net/images/messageboard/retalt/Menuki.jpg\n  &gt; \n  &gt;   Thanks,\n  &gt;   Brian \n  &gt; \n  &gt; \n  &gt; \n  &gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n\n  SPONSORED LINKS Art history  Fine art  Art history book  \n        Fine art lamps  Fine art online  Fine art poster  \n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  YAHOO!
