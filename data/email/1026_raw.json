The description of lots 253 and 251 appear to be reversed.  The blade signed Kanenaga is actually in the very un-Ezo koshirae labeled 253.  That is the koshirae you linked to and it is correctly described under lot 251.  It&#39;s quite an unusual piece, but Ezo it is not.\n\nSince I already got into writing this, the term Ezo has been used in a couple of ways and can be confusing.  Strictly in terms of kodogu and koshirae it is usually applied today to examples like lots 225, 230 and 251/253.  There doesn&#39;t seem to be any evidence associating these kind of fittings with the Ainu.  We can talk some more about that type of kodogu if anyone is interested.  I am at least.  \n\nAnother more common use of the term Ezo is associated with the Ainu, and there is a very distinctive type of Ainu koshirae that is usually made up of some typical &quot;Japanese&quot; metal fittings mixed with uniquely Ainu type saya, tsuka and sash.  Again, something for further discussion if anyone wants.\n\nThe metal fittings of the lot you linked to are not what I think of as either Ezo or Ainu, in any usual usage.  The little loop fitting makes me think of a late toppei koshirae (the type made for wear with Western dress).  The saya decoration is very unusual, as is the kashira shape.  The tsuba and kojiri seem to be fillers.  It&#39;s a koshirae that I&#39;d like to look into more.\n\nLet me know if you have more questions, since this is pretty mixed up.\nJim\n\n\n  Jim, the Ezo koshirae is very interesting to me too. Can you give \n  some background on group? I had been under the misimpression that \n  these pieces were Ainu...\n\n  http://www.christies.com/LotFinder/search/alt_images.asp?\n  lObjectID=4179742\n\n  Thanks,\n  Ray\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
