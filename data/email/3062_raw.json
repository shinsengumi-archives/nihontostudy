For an\nillustration and a more detailed explanation please see the link at the\nfoot of this email.\n\nAs part of our general aim to gradually improve the quality of all our\nequipment, one of our number Tracie Anderson, has been learning the art\nof kumihimo, and she has got quite good over the last few years. So much\nso, that her husband Simon, has decided that he wishes to have his sword\nrebound in a silk braid of her making. Likewise several others of our\ngroup are now beginning to form a disorderly queue.\n\nNow, as to my first question; during the period 1500-1640 is there any\nevidence for tsuka ito being made with other than plain colours? \n\nAll the surviving examples that I&#39;ve seen to date, are bound with plain\ncolours, but this could be a function of later re-binding fashion, or\nthe fact that I have really poor eyesight:-) \n\nToday, you see in numerous kumihimo books, a huge range of multi-\ncoloured patterned braid, but they rarely if ever give a date for their\nintroduction. On armour you see the so-called &quot;woodpecker&quot; style used\nfor the mimi-ito and the herringbone type used as part of the trim on\nquality foundation fabrics, but that&#39;s it, as far as I know that is.\nI&#39;ve seen plenty of modern fancy sageo offered for iaitou, but I have no\nidea if this is an in-period or a modern feature.\n\nTracie has made flat braid with spiral, diamond, herring bone, and a\nhost of other patterns and is about to try her hand at woodpecker. She\ncan work with up to 16 different colours at the moment, but is having\nsome more bobbins made to enable her to go up to as many as 32 if needs\nbe.\n\nAs we are about to embark upon having several new custom weapons made\nhere in the UK, with decent iron fittings, including replica Owari\nsukashi tsuba, it would be nice to have all the braid hand made in\ncorrect period patterns (assuming they existed), so that they look more\nlike 16th/17th century swords rather than modern iaitou. Although the\nfittings are correctly hand forged here in the UK, the blades we use are\nsadly not traditionally crafted. They are individually made by a UK\nsmith, with blunt edges and durability as their prime requirement. This\nis because they are used for mock combat, which does involve some\ncontact. It would be a crime to wreck a correctly made piece of art in\nsuch an encounter, and that&#39;s leaving aside the issue of the expense.\n\nNow for my next question; is there any evidence for simple iron fittings\nfor tachi or han-dachi?\n\nAll the tachi that I have come across in books and museums, have been\nmounted with various forms of fine gilt fittings, which is only to be\nexpected, as the common run of the mill type equipment rarely survives\n(again assuming that they existed in the first place). Gilt fittings\nwould be of too high a quality for the class of warriors that we are\ncurrently trying to recreate. Most of us carry uchi-gatana as you would\nexpect, but it would be nice to have the option on mounting the blade in\nhan-dachi koshirae, or having a tachi made. I understand that some no-\ndachi were reputed to have had rather poor iron  fittings, but I have no\nidea if such things were ever applied to the tachi of the lower or\nmiddle ranking mounted warriors. \n\nIncidentally, we will be having a no-dachi made, starting very shortly,\nwhich should be finished in a few months, assuming everything goes well. \n\nFinally, a slightly frivolous question; in combat, the only swords we\nhave that actually &quot;ring&quot; upon their occasional contact with another,\nare of purely symmetrical design. Asymmetric weapons, like rapiers and\nkatana do not ring at all. Now in movies like the Twilight Samurai and\nRan, there can be heard the &quot;ching&quot; of blade to blade contact, leaving\naside any issue of technique, is this just the director having the\neffect dubbed in because the audience expect to hear it, or does the\nreal thing ring? My expectation is that they would not, for as I\nunderstand it, it is the energy oscillating to and fro across a\nsymmetrical weapon that produces the pure note, just like a bell. I ask,\nbecause when giving talks upon Japanese history etc. I often get asked\nwhy our swords do not ring as in the movies. I give the above\nexplanation, but if this failure to ring is merely a function of poorly\nmade replicas, and I&#39;m wrong about the real thing, I would really like\nto know, so I can avoid making a twit of myself in front of a\npotentially educated audience!\n\nOkay, that&#39;s it, any suggestions, advice, heckling?\n\nYours\n\nDean\n***\nDean Wayland\nHead Of The Fight School\nhttp://www.thefightschool.demon.co.uk/SHOGUN.htm\n\n\n"
