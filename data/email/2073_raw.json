They also seem to be available on the market these days.  A lot of the process is in looking carefully at the examples for yourself and seeing how the pieces fit together.  There are bits of information scattered among other books.\n\n  Jim\n\n\n\n    Jim, thanks. Great explanation. Can you recommend a particular book (or\n    books) that deals with these early tsuba at length? Preferably one with\n    English text and lots of pictures :-)\n\n    Matt\n\n\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n        Yahoo!
