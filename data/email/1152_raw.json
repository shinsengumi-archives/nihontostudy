I went last night\nto see it with my wife. I&#39;ve got to say that I was\nextremely well done in my humble opinion. I can see\nthis movie propelling a lot of new students into Kendo\ndojo�s as well as the other areas of martial arts. The\nsame will probably happen to the sword collecting\ncommunity as well. So if changes are to be made to\nattract new members to the sword groups I would\nsuggest that NOW would be the time to update your\nsites with new information for the newer crowd. Forget\nthe market surveys and polling (no offence Pat) but\nyou won�t need them. Within the next month and a half\nto two months I would imagine that anyone with a\nwebsite that is Japanese Sword or Samurai related is\ngoing to be getting a lot of traffic and email with\nquestions. Rich S your site is going to be running way\nover it�s bandwidth I�m sure. It will probably happen\nagain when this movie makes the jump to DVD/VHS and\nthe rest who haddn�t seen it in theaters see it at\nhome. I don�t want to give away any of the story as\nit�s a movie that you have to see for yourself. But I\nwould suggest seeing it if nothing else than for the\nfinal battle scene. Enjoy!\n\nBob R\nAka �Cowboy Bob�\n\n=====\nCheck out &quot;Cowboy&quot; Bob&#39;s Books & Things at:\nhttp://asia.geocities.com/gentleman9/index.html\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nFree Pop-Up Blocker - Get it now\nhttp://companion.yahoo.com/\n\n"
