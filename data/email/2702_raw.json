In my early days of collecting and\nintermittently over many years Mr Han and I enjoyed a lively correspondence.  He\nwas unfailingly helpful, even to an excess of research on my behalf.  Clearly,\nhe enjoyed the task because it increased his own knowledge and awareness of\nNihont�.  One only has to read his &quot;Study at the Sword Museum&quot; series of\narticles in the English NBTHK journals to see the depth of his knowledge and\ncommittment to Nihont� studies and preservation.  His superior knowledge was\ninvaluable to me as I set about trying to find good swords as a beginner.\nThanks to his influence and stirling scholarly example, and that of many others\nin our little community, I have come to regard it as a sacred duty to pass on\nsuch freely given knowledge as I&#39;ve managed to gain over the years.\n\nOver the years Mr Han was a prolific author, although I haven&#39;t seen an article\nby him for quite some years now.  His writings were thorough pieces of research\neruditely expressed and meticulously footnoted.\n\nMr Han was a 9th (?) generation Chinese teaching in Indonesia before he left to\nlive in The Netherlands.  He was a lawyer, I believe.  I still have a photo of a\nkenukigata tachi with a gendait� he acquired from one of his students, the son\nof one of President Soekarno&#39;s close aides.  Mr Han&#39;s wife died some two or so\nyears ago and I remember her passing being mentioned here.  He and his wife had\nno children.\n\nI haven&#39;t corresponded with Mr Han for some years now, but it is time to go and\nhave a read through our correspondence and shed a tear for this great man of\nNihont�, in whose shade those such as I still struggle to learn and understand.\n\nBest regards to all,\n\nBarry Thomas.\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: jonosuke2003 &lt;saemonjonosuke@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Friday, March 11, 2005 10:58 AM\nSubject: [nihontostudy] Mr Han Bing Siong\n\nMr Han Bing Siong, Chairman of the Dutch Token past away today.\nHolland lost a great sensei.............\n\n\n"
