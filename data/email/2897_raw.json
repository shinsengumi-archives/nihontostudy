One reason, perhaps, David couldn&#39;t find any \ninfo without the specific kanji.\n\tAs it happens I spoke to Sasama Yoshihiko Sensei the other \nday and he also had not heard of any such connections between this \ndesign and the aforementioned persons. However another friend said \nthat the association is connected to another design with similar \nelements. I haven&#39;t an example I can point to but I was told that \nwhen you see a single kaede leaf in opposition to a single horn \npresented equal in size, the theme is still Kasuga. However there is \nthe added association with Takeda Shingen and Uesugi Kenshin because \nthe two elements in the design like the two famous generals were \nequal neither able to defeat the other. He couldn&#39;t cite any sources \nand it was just something he had heard. I hope to ask other \nknowledgeable people in the next couple of days just to see, if they \ntoo have heard something similar...\n-t\n\n"
