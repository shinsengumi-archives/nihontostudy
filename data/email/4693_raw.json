I remember my \ndistress some years ag=\r\no when, upon being informed of my research on \nthe group, a senior member o=\r\nf the To-ken scene in GB replied Oh Dear, \nbut he supposed that somebody ha=\r\nd to do it!\n\nThe tsuba that Ron describes as being &#39;made in two pieces&#39; is =\r\n\nprobably one of many tsuba which were made in the mid-C19 for sale to \nfor=\r\neigners in Nagasaki.  These were made in two non-contiguous halves \nthat, w=\r\nhen joined together gave the impression of undercutting.  In \nthe better of=\r\n these they were joined by a mimi; in the others they \nwere simply soldered=\r\n together.\n\nThe Hozon Namban tsuba posted by Richard is very nice.  The gol=\r\nd \nsleeves that he comments upon appear to be inserts intended to tidy \nup =\r\nthe irregularities in the design left by the later addition (or \nshould I s=\r\nay subtraction) of the ryo-hitsu.\n\nPlease keep them coming.\n\nRegards, John =\r\nL.\n\n--- In nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Ron Hartmann&quot; &lt;swords@...&gt; \nwrote=\r\n:\n&gt;\n&gt; Dear John - \n&gt; \n&gt; Well you tweeked the ego button...will post a photo=\r\n or two of that \nnice namban early-on this week. May dig out another unique=\r\nly \nstructured namban that I featured in an old JSS/US article years \nback.=\r\n That one appeared to be made in two pieces and the &quot;sides&quot; \nsomehow &quot;welde=\r\nd&quot; together. Never came across another like it since \nthat time. \n&gt; \n&gt; Namb=\r\nan are really interesting tsuba and I think they just got a bad \nrap years =\r\nago because of so many more &quot;common&quot; ones being found. You \nsee some very n=\r\nice namban work turn up on Japanese sites and when in \nTokyo in October, I =\r\nsaw several very nice examples -- high priced \nexamples, I might add. As wi=\r\nth all kodogu, you have lots of average \nquality stuff, some average-good a=\r\nnd then the lesser found great \nquality works. It&#39;s what makes this study s=\r\no interesting!\n&gt; \n&gt; Ron\n&gt; STL\n&gt; \n&gt;   ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt;   From=\r\n: Dr John P Lissenden \n&gt;   To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n&gt;   Sent: Sund=\r\nay, December 03, 2006 4:20 AM\n&gt;   Subject: [nihontostudy] Re: Masahisa\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt;   Dear Rick\n&gt; \n&gt;   Not wishing to be &#39;picky&#39;, I tend to believe that th=\r\ne mistaken \n&gt;   tendency to discount Namban tsuba is based upon their gener=\r\nal \npoor \n&gt;   quality of design and production rather than upon the fact th=\r\nat \nthey \n&gt;   are cast. In an attempt to salvage the reputation of this gro=\r\nup \n&gt;   perhaps, if you ask him nicely, Ron Hartman will send you an \nimage=\r\n of \n&gt;   his Tokubetsu Hozon Namban tsuba?\n&gt; \n&gt;   Regards, John L.\n&gt; \n&gt;   -=\r\n-- In nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com, &quot;nihontochicken&quot; &lt;rick@&gt; \n&gt;   wrote:\n&gt; =\r\n  &gt;\n&gt;   &gt; Nothing of import to add, really.
