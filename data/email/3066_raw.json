I will try to answer a few of your questio=\r\nns very\nsimply. You can see photos of contemporary mounts for the period in=\r\n question\nin the Tokyo National Museum publication Uchigatana Koshirae. You=\r\n will see\nthere that the earlier wraps are done in leather, typically a dar=\r\nk green or\nblue along with black and the lacquered over. The same is also l=\r\nacquered\nblack and the saya are leather wrapped and also lacquered black. T=\r\nsuba are\ntypically plain iron, there is a simple fuchi, more decorative men=\r\nuki,\nsometimes in gold or with a lot of gold foil coverings and a black-lac=\r\nquered\nhorn kashira with the handle wrap going over the tip of the kashira.=\r\n Katana\ntypically have a kogai in the saya and the saya have a distinctive =\r\nround\nkurikata and an &quot;obi-hook.&quot; As you move into the Momoyama period wrap=\r\ns and\nsaya get gaudy with multicolored leather wraps, red saya and what not=\r\n. I\nsuggest you get the uchigatana book, which will answer all your questio=\r\nn\nvisually.\n\nGordon\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: nihontostudy@yahoogro=\r\nups.com [mailto:nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com] On\nBehalf Of Dean Wayland\nSen=\r\nt: Tuesday, June 28, 2005 9:03 PM\nTo: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com; nihonto=\r\n@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: [nihontostudy] An introduction and three question=\r\ns\n\nDear All,\n\nThis is my first post to this list, and before asking my ques=\r\ntion I felt\nthat it would make sense for me to briefly say a little about m=\r\nyself and\nwhat I do, so that you can better respond to my queries.\n\nI run a=\r\n tiny historical re-enactment society here in the UK, which is\ntrying to po=\r\nrtray the period of first contact between Europeans and the\nJapanese (1543-=\r\n1640) to a reasonable degree of authenticity. For an\nillustration and a mor=\r\ne detailed explanation please see the link at the\nfoot of this email.\n\nAs p=\r\nart of our general aim to gradually improve the quality of all our\nequipmen=\r\nt, one of our number Tracie Anderson, has been learning the art\nof kumihimo=\r\n, and she has got quite good over the last few years. So much\nso, that her =\r\nhusband Simon, has decided that he wishes to have his sword\nrebound in a si=\r\nlk braid of her making. Likewise several others of our\ngroup are now beginn=\r\ning to form a disorderly queue.\n\nNow, as to my first question; during the p=\r\neriod 1500-1640 is there any\nevidence for tsuka ito being made with other t=\r\nhan plain colours? \n\nAll the surviving examples that I&#39;ve seen to date, are=\r\n bound with plain\ncolours, but this could be a function of later re-binding=\r\n fashion, or\nthe fact that I have really poor eyesight:-) \n\nToday, you see =\r\nin numerous kumihimo books, a huge range of multi-\ncoloured patterned braid=\r\n, but they rarely if ever give a date for their\nintroduction. On armour you=\r\n see the so-called &quot;woodpecker&quot; style used\nfor the mimi-ito and the herring=\r\nbone type used as part of the trim on\nquality foundation fabrics, but that&#39;=\r\ns it, as far as I know that is.\nI&#39;ve seen plenty of modern fancy sageo offe=\r\nred for iaitou, but I have no\nidea if this is an in-period or a modern feat=\r\nure.\n\nTracie has made flat braid with spiral, diamond, herring bone, and a\n=\r\nhost of other patterns and is about to try her hand at woodpecker. She\ncan =\r\nwork with up to 16 different colours at the moment, but is having\nsome more=\r\n bobbins made to enable her to go up to as many as 32 if needs\nbe.\n\nAs we a=\r\nre about to embark upon having several new custom weapons made\nhere in the =\r\nUK, with decent iron fittings, including replica Owari\nsukashi tsuba, it wo=\r\nuld be nice to have all the braid hand made in\ncorrect period patterns (ass=\r\numing they existed), so that they look more\nlike 16th/17th century swords r=\r\nather than modern iaitou. Although the\nfittings are correctly hand forged h=\r\nere in the UK, the blades we use are\nsadly not traditionally crafted. They =\r\nare individually made by a UK\nsmith, with blunt edges and durability as the=\r\nir prime requirement. This\nis because they are used for mock combat, which =\r\ndoes involve some\ncontact. It would be a crime to wreck a correctly made pi=\r\nece of art in\nsuch an encounter, and that&#39;s leaving aside the issue of the =\r\nexpense.\n\nNow for my next question; is there any evidence for simple iron f=\r\nittings\nfor tachi or han-dachi?\n\nAll the tachi that I have come across in b=\r\nooks and museums, have been\nmounted with various forms of fine gilt fitting=\r\ns, which is only to be\nexpected, as the common run of the mill type equipme=\r\nnt rarely survives\n(again assuming that they existed in the first place). G=\r\nilt fittings\nwould be of too high a quality for the class of warriors that =\r\nwe are\ncurrently trying to recreate. Most of us carry uchi-gatana as you wo=\r\nuld\nexpect, but it would be nice to have the option on mounting the blade i=\r\nn\nhan-dachi koshirae, or having a tachi made. I understand that some no-\nda=\r\nchi were reputed to have had rather poor iron  fittings, but I have no\nidea=\r\n if such things were ever applied to the tachi of the lower or\nmiddle ranki=\r\nng mounted warriors. \n\nIncidentally, we will be having a no-dachi made, sta=\r\nrting very shortly,\nwhich should be finished in a few months, assuming ever=\r\nything goes well. \n\nFinally, a slightly frivolous question; in combat, the =\r\nonly swords we\nhave that actually &quot;ring&quot; upon their occasional contact with=\r\n another,\nare of purely symmetrical design. Asymmetric weapons, like rapier=\r\ns and\nkatana do not ring at all. Now in movies like the Twilight Samurai an=\r\nd\nRan, there can be heard the &quot;ching&quot; of blade to blade contact, leaving\nas=\r\nide any issue of technique, is this just the director having the\neffect dub=\r\nbed in because the audience expect to hear it, or does the\nreal thing ring?=\r\n My expectation is that they would not, for as I\nunderstand it, it is the e=\r\nnergy oscillating to and fro across a\nsymmetrical weapon that produces the =\r\npure note, just like a bell. I ask,\nbecause when giving talks upon Japanese=\r\n history etc. I often get asked\nwhy our swords do not ring as in the movies=\r\n. I give the above\nexplanation, but if this failure to ring is merely a fun=\r\nction of poorly\nmade replicas, and I&#39;m wrong about the real thing, I would =\r\nreally like\nto know, so I can avoid making a twit of myself in front of a\np=\r\notentially educated audience!\n\nOkay, that&#39;s it, any suggestions, advice, he=\r\nckling?\n\nYours\n\nDean\n***\nDean Wayland\nHead Of The Fight School\nhttp://www.t=\r\nhefightschool.demon.co.uk/SHOGUN.htm\n\n\n\n \nYahoo!
