My Akasaka of this design signed Ta=\r\ndashige (to my relief) passed shinsa in Chicago. Of course I have it here i=\r\nn front of me now to compare the work with your tsuba. While the design is =\r\nthe same, the work on mine is more delicate (?)--more piercing--and seems t=\r\no &quot;flow&quot; more, if you know what I mean. The horse&#39;s hoofs on your tsuba are=\r\n more &quot;squared&quot; and &quot;bold&quot; than the more naturally shaped hoofs on my tsuba=\r\n. I just saw a similar tsuba (picture) just the other day that showed these=\r\n rather boldly made hoofs and it was called something other than Akasaka, b=\r\nut for the life of me I don&#39;t recall where I saw this. Thought it was in th=\r\ne new Mosle&#39; catalogue, but if so, I&#39;m not finding it now. My tsuba came ou=\r\nt of a large collection of tsuba sold in Santiago, Chile in 2003. That coll=\r\nection also had another similar &quot;horse&quot; tsuba that had these large hoofs li=\r\nke your new tsuba, but I didn&#39;t buy that one. Most of these 730-plus tsuba =\r\nwere bought up by Michael Zomber, so perhaps your&#39;s could be the one I saw.=\r\n I&#39;ll check my records. \n\nRon\nSTL\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: R=\r\nichard Turner \n  To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Thursday, Septem=\r\nber 30, 2004 2:13 AM\n  Subject: [nihontostudy] Akasaka tsuba ?\n\n\n  All, I h=\r\nad a tsuba arrive today, it is a lot better in hand than the \n  original im=\r\nages I purchased it from showed.
