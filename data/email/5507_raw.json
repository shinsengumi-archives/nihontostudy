This is now a searchable index and (if memory serves correctly) has been added to the JSS/US web site as a public service.

I just renewed for 2009.  For those who don&#39;t currently belong, I would urge you to strongly consider springing for a membership.  It is well worth the reasonable dues.  Calls &#39;em as I sees &#39;em.\n\n  Best Regards,\n  Gary Gabelhouse\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
