When there is, it is\n&gt; normally on the back of the blade as a block to a cut. If\n&gt; there is chipping on the edge, it requires repolishing\n&gt; and possibly reshaping of the blade. If the chip is too deep,\n&gt; that is thru the hamon, the blade is generally considered\n&gt; ruined. Cut marks on the back (mune) or side (shinogi) are\n&gt; usually left alone and some collectors consider them marks\n&gt; of honor.\n&gt; \n&gt; Rich S\n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Richard Stein, PhD          alchemyst@...\n&gt;     \n&gt;            The Japanese Sword Index\n&gt; http://www.geocities.com/alchemyst/nihonto.htm\n&gt; http://home.earthlink.net/~steinrl/nihonto.htm\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; nihontostudy-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
