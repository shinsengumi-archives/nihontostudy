They are just \ngeneric fakes.  They are not a copy of any particular sword.  They are \njust sort of Japanese sword shaped, and then marketed as genuine to the \nunwary.  If you type in &quot;Viking sword&quot; on EBay, you will see lots of \nmodern swords that sort of look like Viking swords, but hopefully are \ndescribed as being reproductions somewhere in the description.  I doubt \nif any of them is a particularly good representation of the genuine \narticle, either.\n\nBob\n\nranox27157@... wrote:\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Thank you for the information, I know now I am getting fakes. \n&gt; As far as my fakes I posted pictures of them in a photo album here. \n&gt; Maybe someone can tell me of what they are fakes of?
