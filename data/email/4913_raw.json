There is also a single \nKaregane ( wild geese ) in there as well.\n\nThe tsuba has an NBTHK Tokubetsu Kicho kanteisho to Kyo Sukashi. But in \ncloser study, this guard looks very much like Kyo Shoami. The heavier \nset and general theme and balance are leading me to that conclusion. The \ntsuba has a rich brown patina and the scan does it little justice. I \nwould think this from the early to mid Edo period.\n\nIt&#39;s dimensions are 80mm x 78mm x 5.5mm\n\nSo my question is, was there cross over between Kyo sukashi and Kyo \nshoami, I feel there is generally enough to tell the two schools apart \nbut there is always something new to surprise us I guess. I guess I am \nasking, does this look typical of Kyo Sukashi ?\n\nhttp://www.nihontokanjipages.com/personal/tsuba/kyo-sukashi-winter.jpg\n\nBest wishes\n\nRichard Turner\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
