My first thought was the same as yours, but as far as I&#39;ve been able to find, the aoi that is depicted in the famous mon is Asarum caulescens, which is as you say a wild ginger and pretty similar to the European and North American varieties.  None of them have flowers like that, let alone the vine-like habit suggested by the arabesques.  Looking into the popular names for these plants is confusing -- I may be missing something essential, but I suspect that the lacquer artist was working backward from the mon and just mixed in parts from other plants to go with the aoi leaves.\n\nJim  \n\n  It may also be part of the Aoi  plant (futuba-aoi), mallow or birthwort\n  family (uma no suzukusa) or &quot;Wild Ginger&quot;. Presented on the lacquer ware in\n  arabesque pattern/motif. \n\n  Rick  \n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
