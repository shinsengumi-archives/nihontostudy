As described it sounds like it&#39;s a koshirae \nthat should pass shinsa.  The point to submitting it would be do get \nwritten certification of its age, completeness, quality, etc.  \nWhether that is worth doing is up to you.  There should be an NTHK \nshinsa coming to a coast near you in the next couple or few years.\n\nJim\n\n--- In nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com, &quot;nihontochicken&quot; &lt;rick@s...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; Hi, guys &#39;n&#39; gals, thought I&#39;d drop in momentarily.  Re the thread \non \n&gt; papering koshirae, can I solicit some advice on one of my \nfew &quot;attic \n&gt; finds&quot;?  The blade has already been papered (sent back to Japan, \n&gt; papered hozon, nice old polish Eisho era unokubi zukuri, but \ntired).  \n&gt; The koshirae (not sent) has been assessed by One Who Should Know as \n&gt; original and correct pre-Meiji, absolutely NSW (Not Screwed With).  \n&gt; Mostly in excellent condition, no wear or soil to the tsuka ito, \n&gt; even.  I would guess that papering the koshirae would be a slam \ndunk, \n&gt; except\n&gt; \n&gt; 1. The saya is dinged up.  Not terribly badly, but far from \n&gt; pristine.  It would be a bastard to repair, because in strong \nlight, \n&gt; the &quot;black&quot; lacquer is seen to be black with translucent brown \n&gt; streaks running through it.\n&gt; \n&gt; 2. The kashira is for correct court wear, i.e., it is black horn, \nnot \n&gt; a kinko match for the fuchi (which is signed, though the apparently \n&gt; matching tsuba isn&#39;t).\n&gt; \n&gt; 3.  Though the tsuba has the hitsu, there are no accessories, and \nno \n&gt; provisions for any in the saya.\n&gt; \n&gt; Sooooooo, would there be any real point to submitting this to \n&gt; shinsa?  It is pre-Meiji original, but no &quot;knock your socks off&quot;.  \n&gt; Just wondering, in case a shinsa shows up again on the US west \ncoast \n&gt; in my lifetime!\n&gt; \n&gt; NC  ;o)\n\n\n"
