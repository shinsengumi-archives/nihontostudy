I noted that there have been a lot of\nminty ones on ebay lately and wondering if they are being\nrepro-ed.\n\nAlso as to their age. One seller on ebay said Muromachi.\nAll the books that I recall say late Edo. One Torigoye\nbooks says they are poor tsuba and to stay away from from\nThe Shinchu Zogan Tsuba book that covers Onin, Heianjo (mostly),\nYoshiro and Ko-Shoami shinchu zogan doesn&#39;t mention them nor\npicture anything like them.\n\nWhat&#39;s the story here? Age? etc. Are these like the &quot;Mito\nShoami&quot; tsuba, that really aren&#39;t any particular school.\nI&#39;ve a daisho in gomoku zogan with Saotome type hammered\nplates. I like them regardless. Just wondering what they\nare all about.\n\nRich\n------------------------------------------------------------\n Richard Stein, PhD          alchemyst@...\n      \n             The Japanese Sword Index\n  http://www.geocities.com/alchemyst/nihonto.htm\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n"
