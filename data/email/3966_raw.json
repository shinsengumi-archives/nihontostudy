In general, yes, tekkotsu are a good thing, at least for Owari region work.  I can&#39;t think of a case where it would indicate poor quality.  It&#39;s part of what separates the better Owari, Kanayama, etc., work from the routine products.\n\nThe mid to late Muromachi period is prime time for tekkotsu and they continue to a lesser degree in Momoyama.  Early Edo period Yagyu, Ono and sometimes Akasaka will also show them, although not in quite the same way as Muromachi period Owari sukashi or Kanayama.  In general they are not seen in Edo period work.  Norisuke and other late Edo copies of Yamakichibei, Kanayama, Nobuie, etc., will show tekkotsu, but they generally look forced and artificial, often oversized and overdone.  Of course sometimes maybe they got it right too, and we&#39;re still being fooled by those pieces.\n\nOccasionally Edo period Shoami work will be carved to simulate tekkotsu and other features of earlier-period smiting.\n\nJim\n\n\n\n  Jim,\n\n  BRILLIANT - one picture is truly worth a thousand words, let alone five!  I\n  don&#39;t believe I have ever seen this in real life, so after 40 years collecting\n  blades and only occasionally finding tsuba I can now look out for tekkotsu\n  &quot;seriously&quot;.  A couple of questions spring to mind:\n\n  - Is tekkotsu limited to a &quot;time window&quot;??  That is, is it only found in certain\n  iron tsuba (sukashi??) from say (hahaha) 1500 to 1620??  I guess most Edo iron\n  tsuba don&#39;t have tekkotsu.\n\n  - Is tekkotsu when found a &quot;good&quot; indicator???\n\n  Thanks for great pics.\n\n  Best regards,\n  Barry Thomas.\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
