I believe the owner made a substitution (he had\n&gt; only so many slots and given me more items than he had\n&gt; slots). Same owner as the Myochin.\n&gt; \n&gt; The design is exactly the same as Rich&#39;s, but it did\n&gt; not feel Akasaka. The mimi on Akasaka usually feels\n&gt; more full, rounded. Then the actual plate on the tsuba\n&gt; was ~perfectly~ flat and the sukashi so crisp in\n&gt; execution that it felt almost machined precise in\n&gt; execution.\n&gt;     I mentally ruled out Akasaka, and was curious to\n&gt; see the shinsa results on it. The fact that I don&#39;t\n&gt; would point towards either (a) early senility or (b)\n&gt; that this was the one substituted out.\n&gt; \n&gt; Jim, (sidenote) at the time I was surprised at the\n&gt; Myochin call on the other tsuba. I would have thought\n&gt; that it ended up in some group I was less familiar\n&gt; with. Interesting tsuba.\n&gt; \n&gt; Any preview on the Yagyu exhibit for those\n&gt; international listeroos that won&#39;t get to see it?\n&gt; \n&gt; Curran\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- Jim Gilbert &lt;jggilbert@E...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Curran,\n&gt; &gt; Number 482 was a Myochin tsuba with a circular cross\n&gt; &gt; section rim and a design of two large diamond shapes\n&gt; &gt; at 12:00 and 6:00.  That&#39;s the only thing similar in\n&gt; &gt; your group.  I know the owner, so I&#39;m guessing it&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; the one you&#39;re thinking of.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve seen the spiral motif used on a guard signed\n&gt; &gt; Tadatoki, and as Rich said the insect is often seen\n&gt; &gt; in Akasaka sukashi.  I don&#39;t think Akasaka is a bad\n&gt; &gt; call. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Rich, what&#39;s putting you off Akasaka?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Back to the Yagyu,\n&gt; &gt;  Jim\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   Rich,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   At the Chicago 2004 NTHK Shinsa, I papered a near\n&gt; &gt;   identical (very pristine condition) tsuba for a\n&gt; &gt;   friend. I do not remember what the attribution\n&gt; &gt; was-\n&gt; &gt;   but I know it was not Akasaka.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   I do not know if Jim G. has easy access to those\n&gt; &gt;   records, but I believe the tsuba was somewhere\n&gt; &gt; between\n&gt; &gt;   the submissions # 460 to 485.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   Jim can probably identify it out of hand, but I\n&gt; &gt;   thought you might also appreciate the Hagihara\n&gt; &gt; notes\n&gt; &gt;   on the similar tsuba.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   Curran\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been\n&gt; &gt; removed]\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \t\t\n&gt; ____________________________________________________\n&gt; Start your day with Yahoo! - make it your home page \n&gt; http://www.yahoo.com/r/hs\n\n\n\n"
