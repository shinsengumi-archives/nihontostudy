It is a 54.9 cm (21 5/8 inch)that is\nbout of polish with chips in the ha (sure hope they are not to deep).\n\nThe blade is signed Heianjo ju Fujiwara Yoshitake.\n\nThere are a number of things that make this an interesting sword.\n\n1. The shingunto mounts have been lacquered the dark green often seen\n\ton the army mounts but this lacquer is painted over same and a \n\twood saya.  The same is lifting way from the wood so you can\n\tsee the method of construction.\n    I knew that kai-gunto had lacquer over same but not shin-gunto.\n    \nHas anyone seen this type of construction on a shin-gunto?\n\n2. There is a silver (silver like) metal star on the tassle.  I have \n\tnever seen anything attached to tassles. \n\nHas anyone seen a star on a tassle?  What might it mean???\n\n3. When I went to pick up the sword.  The wife of the gave me a picture.\n\tShe said that her late husband did not talk much about his time\n\tduring WWII but she pointed to the person standing in the back \n\trow to the right (looks like army uniform) and said that was\n\tthe owner of the blade.\n\nCAn anyone translate what is written on the back of the picture?\n\nYou can see images at\n\n\thttp://www.montanairon.com/swords.html\n\n\tthen click on #7 Images to view and it will the the top sword.\n\nThanks for any help.\n\nlater\ndavid (I plan to post this on a couple of email lists)\n\n\n\n\n-- \nDavid McDonald                  Collector of Japanese Swords and Old Iron \nPO Box 265                      WEB page - http://www.montanairon.com \nSidney MT  59270                email - jswords@... \n406-482-3243  evenings          I do tsukamaki (wrapping of sword hilts) \n\nOwner of White IH Cub & Super A Farmall, IH 100 & 130, 140, AC G  \nMcD type M, Monitor, Frost King and other stationary engines. \n\n\n\n"
