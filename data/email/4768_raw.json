The only feature that may be\n&gt; considered common to \n&gt; &gt; them both is some evidence of a Chinese influence.\n&gt;  However, while \n&gt; &gt; with Namban tsuba this resulted in a completely\n&gt; novel metalworking \n&gt; &gt; technique, Soten tsuba use conventional, Japanese\n&gt; techniques to \n&gt; &gt; illustrate historical sujects which may be of\n&gt; Chinese derivation.  \n&gt; &gt; But there a lots of differences:-\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Soten tsuba came initially from a recognised\n&gt; &#39;school&#39; of makers, \n&gt; &gt; although they were later mass produced outside\n&gt; this.  There was \n&gt; never \n&gt; &gt; a recognised Namban &#39;school&#39;, the namban influence\n&gt; being ubiquitous.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Namban tsuba had their origin in China, were\n&gt; imported into Japan at \n&gt; &gt; the end of the C16, and reached the peak of their\n&gt; popularity in the \n&gt; &gt; late C18.  Soten tsuba date from the early C18 and\n&gt; continued to be \n&gt; &gt; made, as poor quality shiiremono, into the late\n&gt; Edo period.  \n&gt; &gt; (Although I have no evidence for this, I suspect\n&gt; that many of the \n&gt; &gt; latter may also have been produced using the &#39;lost\n&gt; wax&#39; method of \n&gt; &gt; casting.)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; True examples of the Namban group are\n&gt; characterised by extensive \n&gt; &gt; openwork and undercutting, whereas with Soten\n&gt; tsuba, while they may \n&gt; &gt; demonstrate some degree of openwork, this is not a\n&gt; constant feature \n&gt; &gt; and never includes undercutting.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Namban tsuba commonly have profuse gold\n&gt; decoration, either as \n&gt; nunome-\n&gt; &gt; zogan or fire gilding.  Soten tsuba are\n&gt; characterised by selective \n&gt; &gt; and delicate inlays of gold, silver, copper and\n&gt; shakudo.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Soten tsuba do not demonstrate the decorartive\n&gt; mimi, seppa-dai and \n&gt; &gt; ryo-hitsu which characterise Namban tsuba. \n&gt; Signatures, although \n&gt; &gt; admittedly usually gimei, feature frequently on\n&gt; Soten tsuba and \n&gt; &gt; almost never in the Namban group.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The design on Soten tsuba is themed, being is\n&gt; representative of \n&gt; &gt; specific characters or incidents, while that on\n&gt; Namban tsuba is \n&gt; &gt; purely decorative. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; No, I personally know of no relationship between\n&gt; the two groups.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Regards, John L.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Elliott&quot;\n&gt; &lt;elliott@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; First, I appreciate all the comments that were\n&gt; made in reference \n&gt; to \n&gt; &gt; my \n&gt; &gt; &gt; question about &#39;cast&#39; tsuba.
