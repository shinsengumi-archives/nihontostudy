A number of big bluefin were shown kayoed on a \nJapanese distributor&#39;s floor with the bidding about to start, with \nthe note that they could go for up, to $5k a pop.  A sidebar story \nhad to do with bluefin cutting katana, about five foot nagasa, made \nin semi-traditional manner (seems they were quench hardened \nor &quot;tempered&quot;, though possibly not fold forged, and likely not of \ntamahagane), the heat treatment which resulted in the &quot;loss&quot; of one \nevery now and then.  So it seems that even now, o-dachi live.  &quot;The \nright tool for the right job.&quot;\n\nNC\n\n\n"
