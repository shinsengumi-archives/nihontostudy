I didn&#39;t know in the description that they had a \n&gt;  Netsuke included.  I didn&#39;t go tonight, so I will be bringing my camera \n&gt;  tomorrow to take photos of the item(s).\n&gt;\n&gt;  Thank you,\n&gt;  Kim\n&gt;\n&gt;  David Zincavage wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;  &gt;It is impossible to judge the merit or value of items being auctioned from a description of this sort.  If the fuchi kashira really were Goto, they&#39;d probably be worth more than the estimates, but lots of black and gold Goto-esque kodogu of many levels of quality were produced.  Ojime are netsuke/inro-related, not Nihonto-related.   \n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; \n&gt;  &gt;  ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt;  &gt;  From: Kim Ghobrial \n&gt;  &gt;  To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n&gt;  &gt;  Sent: Friday, July 08, 2005 6:11 PM\n&gt;  &gt;  Subject: Re: [nihontostudy] RE: Question....\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;  Hey all,\n&gt;  &gt;  I&#39;m not sure what is going on, but every time I send something or reply \n&gt;  &gt;  to someone, I don&#39;t get any response from anyone.  I kind of feel like I \n&gt;  &gt;  and my posts are invisible to everyone.  The other lists that I&#39;m on, I \n&gt;  &gt;  get some type of response from someone, and I don&#39;t feel like I&#39;m \n&gt;  &gt;  ignored.  If someone doesn&#39;t know, I would like to know this, if I need \n&gt;  &gt;  to get Photos let me know, but don&#39;t ignore the questions.  There are a \n&gt;  &gt;  lot of folks on this list which has expertise in parts of swords or full \n&gt;  &gt;  swords and then there are folks, like myself which are learning from \n&gt;  &gt;  asking questions and listening to the answers.  I don&#39;t have tons of \n&gt;  &gt;  money for expensive books, what books I do have, do not cover areas \n&gt;  &gt;  which I&#39;m asking questions about.
