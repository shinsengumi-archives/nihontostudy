No same nor kodogu of any type.  I will see if I can \n&gt;find anything. I have seen many online in auction in shirasaya, with and \n&gt;with out Sayagaki. I think these are just resting scabbards and a \n&gt;typical shirasaya is. They would have little application in mounting I \n&gt;think. This also could well be a modern phenomenon.\n&gt;\n&gt;best wishes\n&gt;\n&gt;Rich\n\nThanks again, your help is appreciated.\n\nI&#39;m trying to find out, how, if at all, these kogatana, were\nused/carried, during the 16th and early 17th centuries, when not\nassociated with a daisho or the like. I&#39;m thinking of buying one of Fred\nLohman&#39;s replica kogatana and then having it mounted in appropriate\nfashion (once I know what that is).\n\nIf you come across anything useful, let me know, thanks again.\n\nYours\n\nDean\n***\nDean Wayland\n\n\n"
