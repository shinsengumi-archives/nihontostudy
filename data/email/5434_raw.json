The seller was a gentleman about it and settled \n&gt; up with me, as expected. There were multiple photos. Soon after I made \n&gt; this purchase another alike tsuba was offered out of Japan \n&gt; (350076519430) which looked very nice, but one that I thought looks \n&gt; newer (to my surprise, of course). I was not trying to get a bargain, \n&gt; but hoped to discover a Yoshiro work in a different (than mon-sukashi) \n&gt; for my study. Oh well, maybe next time.

I- for one - would like to see the eBay image of your recent\n&gt; acquisition. Would you care to post it?\n&gt; Peter\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;ve always enjoyed Heianjo (never owning an Onin work that I know of) \n&gt; and Yoshiro\n&gt; mon-sukashi works. Always like brass inlay on good iron!\n&gt;\n&gt; To my surprise, I just received what I thought looked like a nice \n&gt; early iron with\n&gt; brass inlay tsuba, recently purchased of Ebay, my first Ebay purchase \n&gt; in ages.\n&gt; After 40-odd years I thought I had a good &quot;eye&quot; for such things; just \n&gt; bought a\n&gt; repro! Yikes! Hope to reverse the deal but must admit that &quot;pictures are\n&gt; deceiving&quot; at times. Looks like an honest mistake on the seller&#39;s \n&gt; part, but it\n&gt; points up the importance of in-hand study. (I think others spotted \n&gt; this since my\n&gt; bid was much too low if authentic. Just mentioning this to point out \n&gt; how good (in\n&gt; pictures only) these repros are today.\n&gt;\n&gt; Enjoyed this topic of lacquer on Heianjo works. I once owned a very \n&gt; similar (or\n&gt; same one?) tsuba that was pointed out here. I need to sit down and \n&gt; check some of\n&gt; my other early tsuba for lacquer.\n&gt;\n&gt; Ron\n&gt; STL\n&gt;\n&gt; ----- Original Message -----\n&gt; From: Dr. Philip Vos Fellman\n&gt; To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com &lt;mailto:nihontostudy%40yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Monday, July 21, 2008 8:42 AM\n&gt; Subject: Re: [nihontostudy] clear lacquer\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi All:\n&gt;\n&gt; Heianjo are complex. For a start, most Heianjo (real Heianjo and not \n&gt; Edo period\n&gt; copies) are Momoyama period or earlier. They were mainly made just for \n&gt; a hundred\n&gt; years or so, basically the 16th century. The earlier pieces are \n&gt; sometimes called\n&gt; Onin, but even if you include this group, you still only get the \n&gt; period around\n&gt; 1450-1600. That means that they are old. Many were lacquered. Some \n&gt; were well\n&gt; preserved some were not. The lacquer is part of the overall gestalt. \n&gt; If you see a\n&gt; hundred Heianjo tsuba, 25 or so will be lacquered, of which 5 will be \n&gt; in excellent\n&gt; condition, 10 will be decently preserved, 5 will be in need of varying \n&gt; degrees of\n&gt; restoration and 5 will be dead.\n&gt;\n&gt; Cheers,\n&gt;\n&gt; Shirogitsune\n&gt;\n&gt; --- On Sun, 7/20/08, bungotakadasword &lt;MuramasaIII@... \n&gt; &lt;mailto:MuramasaIII%40aol.com&gt;&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; From: bungotakadasword &lt;MuramasaIII@... \n&gt; &lt;mailto:MuramasaIII%40aol.com&gt;&gt;\n&gt; Subject: [nihontostudy] clear lacquer\n&gt; To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com &lt;mailto:nihontostudy%40yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Date: Sunday, July 20, 2008, 1:58 PM\n&gt;\n&gt; gang,\n&gt; last time i mentioned noticing &#39; clear lacquer &quot; on most Heianjo tsuba,\n&gt; people thought i was smoking some good weeds....... ....\n&gt;\n&gt; Typical response was ........... fire scales\n&gt;\n&gt; http://www.nihontok anjipages. com/tosogu. com/\n&gt;\n&gt; how about that ?\n&gt;\n&gt; milt\n&gt;\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
