W=\r\nhile I think trying to find the needle in the haystack \nwould be easier, I =\r\ncan at least help point you toward what to look \nfor.\n\n        There are tw=\r\no possible themes referred to with these items; \none is Sugarawa Michizane =\r\nand the other is Tanabata. Since I can&#39;t \nremember who posted the query I w=\r\nill assume you do not instantly \nrecognize these.\n\n        Sugawara Michiza=\r\nne was a famous scholar, courtier and \nminister who ran afoul of certain me=\r\nmbers of the Fujiwara who smeared \nhis name and turned the Emperor agaisnt =\r\nhim. He was known to study \nunder the Plum trees in his garden. When he was=\r\n to leave for exile in \nKyushu, he penned a now famous poem to his trees en=\r\ntreating them to \nsend their sweet Frangrance to him though he be far away.=\r\n At which \npoint one of the trees uprooted and flew off to Kyushu and his p=\r\nlace \nof exile. So if you see plum blossoms this is the theme, and your \nma=\r\ntch might be a scroll with bits of the poem on it, or Michizane \nriding an =\r\nOx, or a simple plum branch.\n\n        Tanabata is celebrated on the 7th day=\r\n of the 7th month, in \nChina it is called Kikoden (Japanese reading here). =\r\nThe lord of the \nheavens allowed his daughter to marry a simple shepard but=\r\n she \nbehaved so badly on the wedding day that he forced them to live on \no=\r\npposites sides of the Milky Way. Once a year they are allowed to see \neach =\r\nother when the Ama no Gawa (River of Heaven) Is bridged by a \nmurder of cro=\r\nws. The rest of the year, she spends pining to see her \nhusband and weaving=\r\n, so is known as Ori-Hime,&quot;Ori&quot; means to weave. In \nthe Chinese tradition f=\r\nresh inkstones were laid outside on &quot;kuzu&quot; \nleaves, on top of these were la=\r\nid bunches of Yam leaves to &quot;catch the \ndew&quot;. On the day of the festival ce=\r\nlebrants would write their wishes \nwith the dewdrops from the river of heav=\r\nen.According to Joly \nthis &quot;emblematic representation of the Tanabata festi=\r\nval was a \nfamiliar theme of tsuba decoration by the Umetada.&quot;\n\n        Sin=\r\nce Ori-hime spends all year wishing to see her husband, \nthis is the one da=\r\ny all year when wishes are fulfilled. So the custom \nis to write your wishe=\r\ns on colored strips of paper, since this is a \nrather romantic story it is =\r\nalso a day for romance and love poems in \nJapan. If along with the inkstone=\r\n and brushes you see leaves, strips \nof paper or a (weaving) shuttle then y=\r\nour theme is Tanabata.\n\n        As was suggested simple kanji might be a go=\r\nod match though I \ncouldn&#39;t find them paired &quot;as a theme&quot;, also an ink well=\r\n with it&#39;s \nlid would be good. According to the Tsuba Gadai Jiten, These ev=\r\neryday \nitems are indespensable, ink and brush are inseperable. So I guess =\r\n\nthey symbolize a well ordered world, a well rounded gentlemen=A1=C4\n\nHopin=\r\ng this helps, \n-t \n\n\n\n"
