Similar central design element.\n&gt; Along a timeline, I&#39;d say yours definitely falls\n&gt; chronologically between my 2 examples.\n&gt;\n&gt; To be honest, I was a little surprised the Waterwheel\n&gt; Tsuba papered to Akasaka. The photo&#39;s is odd/bad and\n&gt; in hand the tsuba is more distinct, with nice iron\n&gt; nodules. Iron is very refined, not needing to be so\n&gt; heavily reworked as the 3rd gen? tsuba.\n&gt;\n&gt; The 3rd gen? tsuba is very thick, and feels it was\n&gt; hammered out from from a center mass. Heavy as a\n&gt; brick.\n&gt;    From memory, dimensions are 68mm x 65mm x 6.25 mm.\n&gt; Thins out about .75mm to 1mm to the mimi, with mimi\n&gt; thickness greatest closer to design elements.\n&gt;\n&gt; Curran\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- Richard Turner &lt;ikkanshi@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Hi Curran, thanks for responding. I don&#39;t have it\n&gt; &gt; hand as yet, when I do\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ll scan it and measure it properly and post the\n&gt; &gt; pics though the\n&gt; &gt; measurements I do have are 76 x 76 x 5 mm.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Rich\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Curran Campbell wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Rich,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I would agree with you pretty much on every point.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Has that Higo / Akasaka feel to it and iron looks\n&gt; &gt; &gt; cleaner, such that I would say mid to later\n&gt; &gt; Akasaka.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The central design is very similar to one of the 2\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Akasaka tsuba I own (though shape and iron quality\n&gt; &gt; are\n&gt; &gt; &gt; different). Basically a sense of &#39;swirling motion&#39;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; with paulownia flowers. It is one of my better\n&gt; &gt; tsubas\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and I believe it to be probably 3rd generation or\n&gt; &gt; &gt; around that time, though Jim G. has seen it and\n&gt; &gt; can\n&gt; &gt; &gt; correct me.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;    Since the central design element is so close,\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ll\n&gt; &gt; &gt; try and photograph & post it for\n&gt; &gt; &gt; comparison/discussion.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; How thick is it at center? Does it thin out a mm\n&gt; &gt; or\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 2mm by the mimi?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Curran\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been\n&gt; &gt; removed]\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;      \n&gt;            \n&gt; __________________________________\n&gt; Do you Yahoo!?\n&gt; Win a $20,000 Career Makeover at Yahoo!
