Dr. Stein has some good eyes. I\n&gt; would not have thought Umetada from the earlier\n&gt; images.\n&gt;    Pretty sure it is Umetada.

I\n&gt; &gt; just spent a couple\n&gt; &gt; of hours scanning and photographing the mei and\n&gt; &gt; tsuba, after which I\n&gt; &gt; took into photoshop and as carefully as possible,\n&gt; &gt; masked all the strokes\n&gt; &gt; I could see and then added some contrast to just\n&gt; &gt; those areas. I think\n&gt; &gt; the good Dr Stein&#39;s guess of Umetada may be correct.\n&gt; &gt; The top character\n&gt; &gt; definitely look like Ume and a couple of you already\n&gt; &gt; thought the bottom\n&gt; &gt; was tada. I would be interested in others thoughts.\n&gt; &gt; cheers\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Rich T\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; http://www.image-hosting.net/images/messageboard/retalt/Umetada-Tsuba.jpg\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; http://www.image-hosting.net/images/messageboard/retalt/Umetada-Tsuba-Mei.jpg\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; __________________________________\n&gt; Do you Yahoo!?\n&gt; SBC Yahoo!
