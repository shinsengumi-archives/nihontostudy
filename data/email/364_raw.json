A mate and I were talkin swod \n  tok the\n  &gt; other night and we were discussing tanto. He mentioned and sent \n  pics of\n  &gt; a very small blade that measures app 22cm in total length. As it \n  turns\n  &gt; out, I have one almost identical in size. Mine, as is his is also \n  quite\n  &gt; thick, both about 7 or 8 mm at the munemachi, very much like a\n  &gt; yorio-doshi only far too short.\n  &gt; \n  &gt; Paul mentioned that he was told his was made as a gift for the \n  wife of a\n  &gt; samurai as a wedding present. He believes his to be mid/late edo \n  and\n  &gt; traditionally made. MIne is out of polish and hard to see hada or \n  hamon,\n  &gt; nie, nioi etc.. but the rest of it looks pretty similar.\n  &gt; \n  &gt; here is a link to the two tanto Tantos \n  &lt;www.whiz.com.au/richard/tantos.jpg&gt;\n  &gt; \n  &gt; I believe blades were common gifts for samurai wife&#39;s and I would \n  expect\n  &gt; them to be smaller than usual but 22 cm is pretty small and more \n  like a\n  &gt; child&#39;s size, though I guess weilded properly, could inflict just \n  as\n  &gt; much damage as a 30cm tanto.\n  &gt; \n  &gt; looking forward to all opinions.\n  &gt; \n  &gt; cheers\n  &gt; \n  &gt; Rich\n  &gt; \n  &gt; \n  &gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n        Yahoo!
