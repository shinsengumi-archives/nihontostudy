Upon their \ndeck is placed a small cup of fresh water, besides an incense cup and some \nbanners bearing the manju (svastika, fylfot), with the cross arms turning \ntowards the right, or sometimes, but rarely turning towards the left \n(suvastika).  They are used on the Festival of the Dead (Ura bon ye).&quot;  Also \nI found this info:\nThe svastika is a symbol of auspiciousness (svast = auspiciousness). It has \nbeen used as a symbol of the sun or of visnu or even of ganesa. It also \nrepresents the world-wheel, the eternally changing world, round a fixed, \nunchanging centre or god.\n\nSvastika marks depicted on doors or walls of buildings or an animals, are \nbelieved to protect them from the wrath of evil spirits or furies of nature.\n\nI have seen this mark on old maps, marking the place of temples in Japan, so \nI know the Japanese used this symbol to represent more than what I found out \ntonight.  I&#39;m sure Jim or Tom probably knows...\nMike\n\n\n&gt;From: Curran Campbell &lt;neobliviscar@...&gt;\n&gt;Reply-To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;Subject: Re: [nihontostudy] Re: Tsuba Mystery\n&gt;Date: Thu, 17 Nov 2005 10:21:47 -0800 (PST)\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Ok-, I figured someone more knowledgable would speak\n&gt;up on this rather straighforward topic. I know little\n&gt;about Buddhism, am not much into comparative religion,\n&gt;or religious symbology, etc. This is all very much\n&gt;armchair commentary, so everyone feel free to correct\n&gt;me....\n&gt;\n&gt;Your clockwise swastika:        Nazi symbol\n&gt;Your counter-clockwise symbol:  Occurs both in\n&gt;Buddhism and\n&gt;                                Southwest American\n&gt;Indian symbol\n&gt;\n&gt;You will see it on the neck of some Budda statues ,\n&gt;right in the little divet between the collar bones.\n&gt;Meaning? I am not sure. Memory says to me something\n&gt;about the 10,000 lives or 10,000 incarnations of\n&gt;Budda? Someone with a copy of Joly want to help?\n&gt;      Memory also says it showed up in Southwest\n&gt;American items. I can&#39;t name the tribes or give you\n&gt;much more than that. I also believe it was adopted by\n&gt;our US Military from the Indians and used by troops\n&gt;until it became associated with the Nazi party and was\n&gt;&#39;discontinued&#39; by the US. This last bit may be\n&gt;(hystorical myth). I believe most of this is from a\n&gt;documentary or TV show about Southwest Indian culture\n&gt;(cliff/cave dwelling?) I saw about 15 years ago. Some\n&gt;of those historical shows stretch the truth a good\n&gt;bit.\n&gt;\n&gt;As for examples, there are many.\n&gt;\n&gt;See tsuba G0016\n&gt;http://www.nona.dti.ne.jp/~sword/tsuba.htm\n&gt;\n&gt;Another off the top of my head is the complete black\n&gt;and silver Daisho koshirae in the back of the Hahn Bin\n&gt;Siong book. Lovely koshirae. Swastikas galore over\n&gt;everything on them.\n&gt;\n&gt;In short, it is a buddhist thing as far as I have\n&gt;bothered learning to date. If someone has a copy of\n&gt;Joly or is more familiar with Buddhist imagery than\n&gt;me, please add.\n&gt;\n&gt;Curran\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;--- pac0datac0 &lt;Pac0daTac0@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Thanks for the info. I still haven&#39;t been able to\n&gt; &gt; find any tsubas with\n&gt; &gt; swastikas on them. Anyone know of any links to sites\n&gt; &gt; that might\n&gt; &gt; discuss the symbolism of swastikas on the katana\n&gt; &gt; tsuba?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;__________________________________\n&gt;Yahoo!
