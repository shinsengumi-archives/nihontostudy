I have seen this type of guard receive a \nkanteisho, but they are not held in the same regard as early \nYamakichibei tsuba.\n&gt; \n&gt; What is the other guard made out of?  I have seen Kagamishi tsuba \nwith that &quot;worm eaten&quot; design.  I haven&#39;t specifically seen it \ncombined with mon like that, but I have seen the worm eaten rim \ncombined with other motifs.  So, not unusual if it is done in a \ncopper-based alloy with a dark patina.  \n&gt; \n&gt; The photos make it look like an iron guard, and if it is then that \nis something I haven&#39;t seen before.  In that case I would guess that \nit&#39;s a cast taken from a Kagamishi tsuba.\n&gt; Jim\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   Dear Listeros:\n&gt; \n&gt;   I was wondering if you could help me out on these 2 tsuba.\n&gt; \n&gt;   First is Yamakichibei:\n&gt;   http://www.nihontophile.com/Yamak1.jpg\n&gt;   http://www.nihontophile.com/Yamak2.jpg\n&gt;   Note that the plate looks old, old traces of lacquer and the \ntsuba \n&gt;   is of 3 plate construction (two thin outer layers and a thicker \ncore-\n&gt;   you can see it in the hitsui ana).\n&gt;   Which generation?\n&gt; \n&gt;   Second I have never seen a tsuba like this:\n&gt;   http://www.nihontophile.com/Shoami1.jpg\n&gt;   http://www.nihontophile.com/Shoami2.jpg\n&gt;   Which school? (Shoami?)\n&gt; \n&gt;   Thanks very much for looking,\n&gt;   Ron\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
