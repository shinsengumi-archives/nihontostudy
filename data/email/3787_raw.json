Interesting idea Pete.  Bushu Kunihiro used the same type of sekigane.  Akasaka Tadashige made them some of the time as well.  The Toryusai group used a smaller, different form, but still standardized inlaid sekigane.  Anyway, the Suruga, et al, style of sekigane is often seen quite beaten down and it may well have been originally done with the intention of saving the iron plate from abuse.  I don&#39;t know whether it would have affected wear of the nakago.\n\nJim   \n\n\n\n  Good day to all.  I was looking at a Bizen Suruga tsuba and reading up \n  on the school in comparison to Bizen Shoami when it occured to me that \n  the placement of the kuchi beni (sekigane) by the tsubako as part of \n  the design may have been a purposeful endeavor to reduce wear to the \n  nakago or possible shock-related fracture to the tsuba as well as for \n  the fitting of the blade.  It just hit me that the use of a more \n  plastic metal would result in a two-fold benefit of helping to prevent \n  these named problems and also in fascilitating the fitting and later \n  tightening of the tsuba to it&#39;s sword.  That this practice occured in \n  Bizen could make sense in that they had a long history of sword \n  manufacture and when the Haruta family moved to Bizen and began tsuba \n  fabrication (Tsuba An Aesthetic Study pg. 31)they looked for advice \n  from the local smiths and began placement of the copper shims on their \n  observations/advice.  Just a bit of conjecture but as I have seen \n  swords with considerable wear to the nakago from ill-fitting \n  (assumption) tsuba it may be a plausible assumption.  The placement at \n  the top and bottom would also seem to make sense as the primary axis of \n  shock-force delivery would occur on this plane from strike/rebound \n  energy and would help explain why circumfirential placement was not \n  utilized.  Interesting.\n\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
