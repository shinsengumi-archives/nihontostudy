Paul Allman took apart a set of the original newsletters and rearranged them according to a logical table of contents.  The first two volumes are as easily accessed as the Nihonto Koza or similar encyclopedia.  \n\nVolume I covers Koto, arranged by the classical road system.\n\nVolume II is Shinto and Shin-Shinto, followed by History of the Japanese Sword, Identification of Nihonto through Shape, and Definition of Nihonto and its Nomenclature.\n\nVolume III includes Historical figures, Famous Swords in Japanese History, Kokuho, Missing Kokuho and Juyo Bijutsu and Kyoho Meibutsu Cho\n\nVolume IV continues Kyoho Meibutsu Cho, several articles by others, the Tokugawa Jikki and an extensive compilation of Random Thoughts.\n\nSome of the most interesting material is in later two volumes, but an index would greatly enhance their usability.\n\nThe Allman version came out over ten years ago, but was &quot;off the market&quot; until recently.  I see that latest offering does not include binding of the four volumes, so be sure to get them into some sort of binding before the pages get mixed up. \n\nJim\n\n\n  Everyone can latch on to one, because the NCJSC reprinted it.\n\n  http://www.ncjsc.org/NCJSC_Publications_4_04.pdf\n\n\n    Hi:\n    The Yamanaka Newsletter is second to none as a useful source of comprehensive and detailed information on the Japanese sword - coming as a newsletter it has certain natural limitations of easy use, ie, it isn&#39;t easy to use, but it is virtually without peer.\n    If you can latch onto one, do!\n    AF\n\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; jdz@... 08/04/05 11:21 AM &gt;&gt;&gt;\n    I would strongly recommend additionally:\n\n   Albert &quot;Kozan&quot; Yamanaka, reformatted by Paul R. Allman, The Nihonto Newsletters, 4 volumes, San Francisco: Northern California Japanese Sword Club, (1994), 2004.\n\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
