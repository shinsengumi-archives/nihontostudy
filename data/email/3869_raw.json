I refrained to participate, but I mi=\r\nght add,\nand I am pretty sure you are aware of this thinking, with Owari, t=\r\nekkotsu of\nthe type exhibited in your piece would prevent most Japanese col=\r\nlectors from\nconsidering anything but late Muromachi for the tsuba and not =\r\nMomoyama or\nearly Edo. The same holds true for Kanayama. It is also interes=\r\nting that\nsome large Owari sukashi looking pieces have been attributed to K=\r\nanayama, no\ndoubt based on the stylistic differences you pointed out. \n\nFin=\r\nally, the link you gave is still to the Owari piece. Do you put up a new\nka=\r\nntei piece?\n\nGordon\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: nihontostudy@yahoogro=\r\nups.com [mailto:nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com] On\nBehalf Of Jim Gilbert\nSent=\r\n: Tuesday, March 07, 2006 12:44 AM\nTo: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com\nSubject=\r\n: [nihontostudy] Kantei setsumei\n\nThe scan of the front of the guard does n=\r\not do it justice, but is sufficient\nto see what&#39;s there.  The photos of the=\r\n mimi give some sense of the tekkotsu\nthat place the guard in the Owari reg=\r\nion.  Given the shape of the rim and\nthe design, the two most likely choice=\r\ns are Kanayama and Owari sukashi.  I\nthink either answer is acceptable give=\r\nn that you are working from pictures.\n\nThe thickness and somewhat squared r=\r\nim lean toward Kanayama, but can also be\nseen in Owari work.  The guard is =\r\non the thick end of the spectrum for\neither type.  The diameter is possible=\r\n for either group, although on the\nlarge side for Kanayama.  The style of t=\r\nhe tekkotsu is the most important\npoint.  Kanayama tekkotsu tend to form pr=\r\nonounced, sometimes rough bumps.\nOwari tekkotsu are low, smooth and emerge =\r\nfrom the plate with more subtlety,\nforming &quot;bean&quot; shaped and &quot;rope&quot; forms. =\r\n This guard shows both of these\nlatter types.  Also, Kanayama guards will o=\r\nften show some tekkotsu on the\nface, but Owari guards do not.\n\nWild goose d=\r\nesigns are common in Owari work.  It&#39;s not impossible to imagine\na design l=\r\nike this in a Kanayama guard, but it is more naturalistic,\ncomplicated and =\r\neven a little delicate for that group.  The majority of the\nevidence points=\r\n toward Owari sukashi.\n\nThe guard is in very good condition, so it may look=\r\n younger than it is.  The\nquality of the iron and the tekkotsu are unlikely=\r\n to date to the early Edo\nperiod, and are consistent with pieces from mid t=\r\no late Muromachi.  The\nbirds at the top and bottom of the sukashi design se=\r\nem too free spirited to\nbe from that time, though and seem more like Momoya=\r\nma.  Given that design is\neasier to manipulate than iron, I lean toward lat=\r\ne Muromachi, but Momoyama\nis possible.\n\nThe guard has a kanteisho to Owari =\r\nfrom the NBTHK.  No date given.\n\nYagyu is in the correct region, but the te=\r\nxture of the metal will be\ncloudy/sandy and will tend to show many linear l=\r\naminations in the rim.  It\nis also not a Yagyu design.\n\nI included this tsu=\r\nba in the Akasaka display at Tampa to show the likely\nOwari origins of the =\r\nAkasaka group.  While some Ko-Akasaka guards will show\ntekkotsu, they are n=\r\not of this type and the color and texture of the iron is\ndifferent.  The ri=\r\nm would show a more rounded shape in Akasaka.  The cutting\nof the sukashi w=\r\nould have sharper edges.  The design does have a bit of\nAkasaka feeling, bu=\r\nt there would probably be more asymmetry and abstraction\nin an Akasaka piec=\r\ne.\n\nThat&#39;s all I can think of at the moment.  Any other observations or\nque=\r\nstions?\n\nJim\n\n\n\n  OK, here is a guard for kantei:\n\n  http://ph.groups.yahoo=\r\n.com/group/nihontostudy/photos/browse/2964?c\n\n  77.0 mm H x 74.8 mm W, 7.2 =\r\nmm thick at the mimi and 7.1 mm thick at the\nseppa dai.\n\n\n  As far as I kno=\r\nw it has not been published, but it has been exhibited at a\ncouple of study=\r\n meetings.  So, if you&#39;ve already seen it and remember the\nattribution, ple=\r\nase don&#39;t post the answer to the list.  It is mumei and\nthere are two almos=\r\nt equally reasonable attributions, but I think that there\nis more evidence =\r\nfor one than the other.\n\n  Respond with your bid on or off list as you pref=\r\ner.\n\n  Jim\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n \nYah=\r\noo!
