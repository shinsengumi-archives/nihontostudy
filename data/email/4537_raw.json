I am\n&gt; presently translating a piece by=\r\n Fukushi sensei on the Higo Hirata \nSchool.\n&gt; There is only one known signe=\r\nd piece and probably three generations \nof\n&gt; Hirata Hikozo. However, in the=\r\n article Fukushi sensei admits that \nhe cannot\n&gt; tell the difference from o=\r\nne generation to the next and so lumps \neverything\n&gt; together as first gene=\r\nration.

I tend=\r\n to believe that a big part of the \nproblem \n&gt; is that so few of us have ve=\r\nnues to learn in person that the \nreliance \n&gt; on books overshadows the fact=\r\n that you cannot learn to recognize \nthe \n&gt; nuances of hataraki from pictur=\r\nes. The details are learned by hands \non \n&gt; study (OK -- that&#39;s loosely put=\r\n LOL) and need guidance from those \nwith \n&gt; great experience. To paraphrase=\r\n what you said, get thee to a good \nshow \n&gt; or study group as often as poss=\r\nible. \n&gt; PS: The same goes for the study of tosogu.\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-=\r\ntext portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n"
