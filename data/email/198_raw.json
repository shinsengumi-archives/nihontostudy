Bill and one of his\nstudents (and I)  published a small paper calling attention to the residual\nstresses within Japanese swords. Bill&#39;s insights was that strong\ncompressive pressure on the hamon contributed to - indeed, allowed - the\nmartensite of the edge to withstand the abuse of a swung sword. I think\nthis is NOT entirely germane to the point the NC is making, but Bill argued\nthat a factor that contributed to the ability to set up the compressive\ntension was the fact that nippon-to are in essence composite structures.\nThat is, they are combination of different orders of steel heightens a\nblade&#39;s ability to hold the cutting edge in compression. That may explain\nthe development of the multi-part cross sections.\nPeter Bleed\n\n\n\n"
