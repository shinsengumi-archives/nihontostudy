Since this information didn&#39;t go out on this list, let me \nadd t=\r\nhat kenkyu-in is the first step to becoming a member of the shinsa \nteam. A=\r\nll of the members of the present team went through the ranks. \nThe next ste=\r\np is shinsa-in hosa, which means an assistant to the shinsa \nteam. Assistan=\r\nts should fill out the working papers -- in Japanese. I \ncould somewhat man=\r\nage this, but in the end, I was given a break. The \nthird stage is full shi=\r\nnsa team member. This all typically takes about \nfour years or so from kenk=\r\nyu-in to full shinsa team member.\n\nI will also try and scan a photo of Chos=\r\nhu-ya&#39;s koshirae. I don&#39;t think \nit sold.\n\nOn 2003.11.8, at 02:54  PM, Jim =\r\nGilbert wrote:\n\n&gt; Gordon,\n&gt; I suspect that there may be iron tsunagi in som=\r\ne of those koshirae.=A0 \n&gt; The older one with the also unillustrated &quot;...mu=\r\nne saku, Nanbokucho \n&gt; blade&quot; was the one that was I was going on about.=A0=\r\n The &quot;younger&quot; one \n&gt; is pretty interesting, too.=A0 I wish I had seen Chos=\r\nhu-ya&#39;s koshirae, \n&gt; but I&#39;d like to have seen a complete example of the ol=\r\nder one even \n&gt; more.=A0 But, I stayed home instead.\n&gt;\n&gt; BTW, I got a copy =\r\nfrom Ian on the yahoo nihonto list of your public \n&gt; mention of the kenkyu-=\r\nin thing there.=A0 Thanks for the recognition.=A0 I \n&gt; have a lot of work t=\r\no do.\n&gt;\n&gt; Jim\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; =A0 Hi Jim,\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; =A0 There is one at Choshu-ya.
