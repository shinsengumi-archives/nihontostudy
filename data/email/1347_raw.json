The construction of a copper core sandwiched between thin gold layers and finished with a fukurin is not that unusual.  It&#39;s seen in Momoyama period Ko-Kinko work for example, often with wave and floating mon motifs.  Most of these are not as high relief as yours and are usually not so crisply carved.  The shape of the hitsu-ana and the general workmanship of this one seem more in line with the Edo period.  Of course the hitsu-ana could have been enlarged later and relined with gold.\n\nThe Genroku period was the next point in time when this kind of display was in style.  My guess is that your guard is from that time  It doesn&#39;t look very late to me.  It could possibly be earlier than Genroku.  Hard to say more without seeing it.  \n\nJim\n\n\n\n  http://tinyurl.com/3cmud\n\n  Gorby und I have been digging through all the tsuba books we \n  have......... nothing  like this turns up in any book.\n\n\n  So.....  this could be a tourist Yokohama special not worthy of \n  illustration ? something so rare that few collections has an example ?\n\n  By the way, it&#39;s not gold paint.........it&#39;s very thin gold foil \n  cover.\n\n  Cary ? Jim ?  Herr professor Robson ?   any thoughts ??\n  anyone ?  please??\n\n  milt\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
