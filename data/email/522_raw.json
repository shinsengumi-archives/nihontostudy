However, the uniformity of the production suggests that there was a &quot;group&quot; making these guards.  Maybe we can know the name of the group.\n\nI called Bob Haynes to ask about the Mito Shoami designation.  He said that he thinks that he is the originator of the term, however he also said that he doesn&#39;t have any concrete proof to tie these guards to Shoami working in Mito.  \n\nI have seen tsuba signed only &quot;Shoami&quot; that appear to be better quality precursors of the so-called Mito Shoami shiiremono style.  Those in turn are similar to some (better yet) Shonai work, and we have already touched on signed and attributed Aizu Shoami work, which Bob also mentioned today.  There seems to be some regional similarity of style, and some association with the Shoami.  However this does not add up to proof of the authorship of these guards or of the existance of a Mito Shoami.\n\nYour original point is valid.  I am going to continue to look into the subject.  Now we have hundreds if not thousands of nameless &quot;anonymous shiiremono&quot; tsuba out there.  Scary...\n\nJim   \n\n\nI&#39;m relieved in a way that your empirical\nobservations coincide with mine.\nI was wondering if indeed Hagihara sensei\nhad in fact papered some tsuba to &quot;Mito Shoami&quot;.\nI would have very much liked to see an example of\nwhat he considered worthy of papering as such.\nAs you know, I have great respect for his opinions.\n\n\n&gt; I assume you can picture the type of tsuba that we have been calling \n&gt; Mito Shoami.  There are many of them in the US and the type is quite \n&gt; uniform.  Who do you think made all of those tsuba?  Serious question.\n&gt; \nIndeed I do.\nSerious answer - Anonymous (no shame in that).\nMuseums often use that term in other fields in cases in which\na work is simply non-attributable to a specific artist or school.\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
