If not Ainu, I am very curious \nwhat the origin of a koshirae like this would be. Perhaps someone \nsimply cobbled this together from the fragments of other koshirae? \nOr, maybe this piece originated outside of Japan.

The little loop fitting \nmakes me think of a late toppei koshirae (the type made for wear with \nWestern dress).  The saya decoration is very unusual, as is the \nkashira shape.  The tsuba and kojiri seem to be fillers.  It&#39;s a \nkoshirae that I&#39;d like to look into more.\n&gt; \n&gt; Let me know if you have more questions, since this is pretty mixed \nup.\n&gt; Jim\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   Jim, the Ezo koshirae is very interesting to me too. Can you give \n&gt;   some background on group? I had been under the misimpression that \n&gt;   these pieces were Ainu...\n&gt; \n&gt;   http://www.christies.com/LotFinder/search/alt_images.asp?\n&gt;   lObjectID=4179742\n&gt; \n&gt;   Thanks,\n&gt;   Ray\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
