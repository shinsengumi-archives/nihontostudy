Fairly classic design and at 81mm x 80mm x 5.5mm it \nis a nice size. One of the traits here that I find most interesting is \nthe mimi, and the obvious fold line that appears in it (it covers about \n30% of the mimi). it is almost like the tsuba was made from a two plate \nconstruction, though I am not suggesting that at all. I assume the \noriginal plate was forged, then folded and forged again before shaping.\n\nI cannot nay that I have seen this so clearly before in an Owari guard \nbefore ( I will also note that I got it to jump out a bit with some \nclever lighting etc) and wondered if it was a normal trait in Owari works.\n\nI really love the iron on this guard, its been well forged and is in \nreally good condition.\n\nhttp://farm7.static.flickr.com/6144/5934784209_807a0a2719_b.jpg\n\nhttp://farm7.static.flickr.com/6132/5934784543_7aa87f9b4a_b.jpg\n\nhttp://farm7.static.flickr.com/6144/5935345246_1aa21c6a64_b.jpg\n\nCheers\n\nRich\n\n\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
