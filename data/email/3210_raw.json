This is a totally  &quot; in your face \ngaudy &quot; tsuba which , in my opinion, is not what wabi-sabi stands for.\n\n\nquestion..........\n1. are those marks on the seppa dai &quot; secret marks &quot; to identify the \nmaker/school ?\n2. Professor Fox Fellman raise the point of a &quot; daimyo tsuba &quot;, is \nthere such a category as Daimyo tsuba ? Personally I think this is \nmore like a presentation tsuba to some &quot; higher level &quot; samurai ( or \non a bad day, some freakingly rich merchants&#39; play thing ).\n\n Thoughts, anyone ?\n\n\nmilt\n\n\n\n\n"
