Once a vibrant and educational medium for \nmany \n&gt;   people sharing our interest, it is now a shadow of its former \nself.  \n&gt;   Messages are posted far less frequently, and often remain \nunanswered.  \n&gt;   Those that are answered seem to produce a rash of self-indulgent \n&gt;   repartee between a few, select members which the remainder of us \nfind \n&gt;   unamusing and tedious.\n&gt; \n&gt;   Is there any hope of a change of direction in order to restore \nthis \n&gt;   message board to its early promise?\n&gt; \n&gt;   JPL.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n"
