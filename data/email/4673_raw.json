Ford regarding fire damaged blades=\r\n and\nretempering.  After reading this article and others, I can say with a\n=\r\nreasonable amount of confidence , Hamon loss due to fire and retempering\nis=\r\n not the case with this blade.\n\nThe blade is obviously not in top condition=\r\n and I also adjusted the\nphoto scene balance in order to hopefully enhance =\r\nthe grain pattern. \nThe pictures do look as though the sword at some time h=\r\nad been recovered\nfrom a fire. Particularly the Hada 2 and 3, but the sword=\r\n really doesn&#39;t\nappear that brown or scaly.\n\nDue to the rough condition of =\r\nthe sword the  Hamon is there, but not\nthat visible.  I really feel as thou=\r\ngh the sword has not had polish\nsince the original. ( There doesn&#39;t seem to=\r\n be any reduction from Nakago\nto blade).  I can also say the sword would lo=\r\nok absolutely stunning with\na fresh polish.   Future decision....\n\nThanks,\n=\r\n\nDave\n--- In nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com, &quot;dwmac2000&quot; &lt;dwmac2000@...&gt; wrot=\r\ne:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Hello Franco,\n&gt;\n&gt; Thank you, Fire damage is something I had not co=\r\nnsidered. I&#39;ve seen a\n&gt; few articles concerning the characteristics of swor=\r\nds subjected to\n&gt; intense heat. I will definitely reread them and pay more =\r\nattention as\nI\n&gt; do!!\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks again,\n&gt;\n&gt; Dave\n&gt; --- In nihontostudy@yaho=\r\nogroups.com, &quot;peonies_waves&quot; peonies_waves@\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hello Dave,\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Based on the images, it needs to be determined whether this sword\nhas=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; been exposed to serious heat. The scaly-dry appearance of the steel\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; is an indication that it might have been. Fires were a problem\n&gt; &gt; throug=\r\nhout Japan&#39;s history that affected many swords. There are\n&gt; &gt; articles writ=\r\nten that describe to some degree what characteristics\nto\n&gt; &gt; look for.\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nIn general, this is one lesson many beginners unfortunately\n&gt; &gt; experience =\r\nat one time or another.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; regards,\n&gt; &gt; Franco\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- In =\r\nnihontostudy@yahoogroups.com, &quot;dwmac2000&quot; dwmac2000@\n&gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hello Again,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;ve managed to post a few photos in my alb=\r\num titled &quot; Interesting\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sword.&quot; The pictures are mediocre at best, bu=\r\nt will hopefully show\n&gt; &gt; &gt; some of its charactoristics. The grain lines in=\r\n the hada 2 photo\n&gt; &gt; &gt; actually shine brightly as opposed to what is seen =\r\nin the picture.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; There is a bit of the hamon which can be seen in the =\r\nupper section\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of the hamon 1 photo. The sword is in obvious need of p=\r\nolish. It\n&gt; &gt; &gt; laid on the battlefield at Okinawa during WWll for several =\r\ndays\n&gt; &gt; &gt; before being discovered by a young Marine. It was stored away wi=\r\nth\n&gt; &gt; &gt; little or no attention since. Oddly, the sword seemed to have\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nfound\n&gt; &gt; &gt; me as opposed to the other way around.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;m trying t=\r\no research the sword and have a little knowledge from\n&gt; &gt; &gt; research I did =\r\non swords my Father brought home from WWll as a\n11th\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Airborne Paratro=\r\noper. I didn&#39;t realize what I was getting into!\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;ve had some m=\r\nuch appreciated input from Ron and Ricky. I still\n&gt; &gt; &gt; think judging from =\r\nthe Nakago condition the sword is most likely a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Bakumatsu era Ko-to c=\r\nopy. If anyone should happen to have opinion\n&gt; &gt; &gt; as to time period or oth=\r\nerwise based on the photos it would be\n&gt; &gt; again\n&gt; &gt; &gt; greatly appreciated!=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Dave\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n"
