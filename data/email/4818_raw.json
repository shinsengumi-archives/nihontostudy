It has been &#39;my&#39; experi=\r\nence that if you are papering for \nauthentication with insight into details=\r\n then the NTHK might be more \nappropriate as they rate by point and give de=\r\nscription sheets with \npertinent information (I believe this is only at the=\r\nir US shinsa and \ndoes not apply to the ones held in Japan).  The NBTHK is =\r\nthe larger \norganization and perhaps has the advantage of greater popular \n=\r\nrecognition/charisma but their papers do not have the worksheets to \nsupply=\r\n information and that listed on their origami (paper) can be \nlimited. It i=\r\ns also a consideration that the NBTHK papers tend to be \nmore expensive to =\r\nobtain.  I have both and have submitted for both -- \nboth organizations are=\r\n worthy of our support.  \n\nAs far as submission (assuming you live outside =\r\nof Japan) for the \nNBTHK you will need an agent to submit and would be best=\r\n served going \nthrough one of the dealer/agents you can find on-line and/or=\r\n by \nrecommendation.  The NTHK has shinsa here in the USA and it would be \n=\r\nwell worth your while to go to the shinsa/show (in Chicago this \nSpring) an=\r\nd be part of the process.  They will have a question/answer \nsession after =\r\nthe close of the day&#39;s session which is very \ninformative.  You also have a=\r\n show to attend in the meantime which \nwill give you great contacts and man=\r\ny ways to spend your savings! \n(LOL)  If you simply can&#39;t go then there are=\r\n again dealer agents who \ncan assist you. \n\nI would strongly suggest that a=\r\nnyone who has the ability to attend \nthe Chicago Show/Shinsa do so.  This i=\r\ns a &#39;hands-on&#39; field and you \nneed all the first hand experience you can ge=\r\nt.  Books are a far \nsecond to what you can learn in person.  Be patient as=\r\n it takes some \ntime to become known and make contacts.  In the long run th=\r\ne faces \nwill become familiar (for better or worse - LOL) and you will find=\r\n \nyour &#39;niche&#39;.  I guarantee it can be time well spent.  Bottom line is \nge=\r\nt full immersion in the field by hands on experience \nwhenever/wherever pos=\r\nsible, keep an open mind, respect your elders, \nwash behind your ears and l=\r\neave the fine tuning for later.\n\n\n"
