One reason, perhaps, David couldn&#39;t find any \n  info without the specific kanji.\n        As it happens I spoke to Sasama Yoshihiko Sensei the other \n  day and he also had not heard of any such connections between this \n  design and the aforementioned persons. However another friend said \n  that the association is connected to another design with similar \n  elements. I haven&#39;t an example I can point to but I was told that \n  when you see a single kaede leaf in opposition to a single horn \n  presented equal in size, the theme is still Kasuga. However there is \n  the added association with Takeda Shingen and Uesugi Kenshin because \n  the two elements in the design like the two famous generals were \n  equal neither able to defeat the other. He couldn&#39;t cite any sources \n  and it was just something he had heard. I hope to ask other \n  knowledgeable people in the next couple of days just to see, if they \n  too have heard something similar...\n  -t\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
