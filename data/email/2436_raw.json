A friend of mine has a Naotane\nwakizashi with a kokuin that reads in katakana &quot;KOROMO&quot;, the town where\nNaotane made the sword.  This stamp has been struck slightly off true.  I&#39;m\nnot in metallurgy either, but I would speculate that when a hardened stamp\nis placed against a tang resting on a very heavy anvil then struck very hard\nwith a 10 kilo hammer, that the softer tang metal truly flows like caramel\nfudge - somewhat like the phenomenon of explosive plastic deformation.  I\nremember reading of a swordsmith in Japan who (in an interview) said that\nmetal can be pushed around from place to place.  So all in all, considering\nwhat little I do know of metallurgy I think it is done as I have outlined.\n\nThe Gassan with the stamp is more likely to be by Sadakazu 1st than\nSadakatsu.  I have a monograph written by Benjamin Hazard of a Gassan I\ntanto in the MMA that has a kokuin (from a failing memory...).\n\nRegards,\n\nBarry Thomas.\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: Richard Turner &lt;ikkanshi@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Wednesday, December 01, 2004 9:29 AM\nSubject: Re: [nihontostudy] kokuin (stamped seals)\n\n\n\nNot being involved in metallurgy at all, could not the stamp be white\nhot and pressed into the nakago ?, keeping the &#39;hot area&#39; to a minimum ?.\n\nRich\n\nRon Hartmann wrote:\n\n&gt; Matt, Rich, all -\n&gt;\n&gt; Yes, the Gassan did this thing, too. The few times I&#39;ve looked at\n&gt; these stamps they really didn&#39;t look like they were &quot;cold stamped.&quot;\n&gt; They don&#39;t appear &quot;sharply&quot; cut nor do they appear &quot;pushed out&quot; around\n&gt; their edges (so to speak). But I can&#39;t understand how you could &quot;hot\n&gt; stamp&quot; a nakago. It would seem the nakago would have to be at a &quot;red&quot;\n&gt; temperature for hot stamping, and that would seem to need to be done\n&gt; before the hamon treatment is done. These stamps seem to be nicely\n&gt; done and in keeping with the rest of a &quot;finished&quot; nakago, not done way\n&gt; ahead of finishing the nakago. Honestly, I have no knowledge of how\n&gt; this is done, other than what has been passed on over the decades. It\n&gt; would be interesting to hear from somebody (swordsmith?) who has\n&gt; first-hand experience on this. Let&#39;s see what others can offer...\n&gt;\n&gt; Ron\n&gt; STL\n\n\n\n"
