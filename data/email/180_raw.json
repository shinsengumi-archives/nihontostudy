Can&#39;t tell much about the menuki or the\ntsuba, which appears to be iron. Kozuka is also difficult to tell much\nabout. Unfortunately, when my daughter was home the last time with her\nboyfriend, they switched my internet connnection to Opera, which only reads\nEnglish, so I can&#39;t read the Japanese text.\nOn a slightly different note getting back to the use of Ko-Tosho and\nKo-Katchushi tsuba, I had mentioned Sasano&#39;s ideas about this. This morning\nI took another look at his book Tosogu no Kigen or Origins of Sword Fittings\n(actually, Katana Fittings). One of the illustrations he cites is the Ban\nDaiagon scroll, which shows an elderly foot solider with an uchigatana that\nhas a tsuba. This scroll dates to the late Heian period. There are other\nwarriors with shorter blades -- koshigatana? -- that are without tsuba.\nThere is also a plain round iron tsuba that would be called a Ko-Tosho that\nwas mounted on a nagamaki. We know this because the seppa were rusted to the\ntsuba and they are large and round of the type that would be for a nagamaki\nhandle. The tsuba is very large at 9.3 cent. across. Anyway, just thought I\nwould share this.\n\nGordon\n----------\nFrom: &quot;Richard Turner&quot; &lt;ikkanshi@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSubject: [nihontostudy] Great Koshirae\nDate: Sun, 4 May 2003 20:27:19 +0800\n\n\nHi all, this site was bought to my attention and I found this Wak. Lovely\nlittle piece but I was particularly struck by the koshirae. I am guessing\nGoto,  I was discussing this with Barry Thomas and his guess was Mino Goto.\nMaybe Jim G could shed some light on it.\n\nI was also curious about the papers, would they be Seikeido&#39;s own kantei\npapers ?.\n\nhttp://www.seikeido.com/seikeido/1kanezumi.htm\n&lt;http://www.seikeido.com/seikeido/1kanezumi.htm&gt; \n&lt;http://www.seikeido.com/seikeido/1kanezumi.htm\n&lt;http://www.seikeido.com/seikeido/1kanezumi.htm&gt; &gt; \n\nThe have some excellent tsuba and some wonderful swords. Bob R, have you\nbeen here ?, I would guess so.\n\nRich T\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\nYahoo!
