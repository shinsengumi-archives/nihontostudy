There is no tell tale sign of design, it is for the most part even \non both sides. There is no soft metal so the picture is not dominated on \neither side. There are no large Tagane on either side so it is hard to \ntell which side was mounted as face out.\n\nAny clues in the design ?, as to which side is which ?.\n\nI think it is the image on the right, by the\nbalance of the images design.\n\nRich\n\nhttp://www.nihontomessageboard.com/tsuba_collection/shoami-bamboo.jpg\n\n"
