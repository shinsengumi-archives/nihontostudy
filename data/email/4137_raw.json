In the case of the \nJingo tsuba, the light wash of gold over the iron I think is the \nunderlying beauty. The bird probably has little to do with it in \nessence. I mean by that, it could be anything other than a bird. It is \nthe iron first, then the shape and the mimi, then the layout of the \nseppa dai and hitsu ana and the design. Then step back and look at the \nthing as a whole. It is why kinko mono is held in low esteem. Take away \naverage or poor work on the top, and there is nothing underneath.\n\nI remember a young collector Richard being educated by this bloke Milt \nwho spent days talking to him about Wabi-Sabi , it took him a while but \nRichard finally sort of got it. The lesson was the aesthetic, the \nunderlying beauty, not what one thinks one sees on the surface. Sound \nfamiliar ?.\n\nRich\n\n\n\nbungotakadasword wrote:\n&gt; all of you diss the hawk tsuba as some sort of &quot; mono &quot;........ base on \n&gt; the ugly execution of the bird.\n&gt; Now tell me........ you find the eagle/hawk as portrait in Jingo tsuba \n&gt; ugly ? Life-like as those by Ishiguro school ?\n&gt; So.......... why is it so highly treasured ?  Because the birds are \n&gt; ugly ?  Or because they say it is &quot; good &quot; and so it is....... ?( sort \n&gt; of like there&#39;s WMD because i said there  is ?  =)   )\n&gt;\n&gt; p.s.  the hawk is gold ( not paint ), not copper/brass based as it \n&gt; doesn&#39;t stain with &quot; magic solution &quot; that stain copper/brass, yes, i \n&gt; tried.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; milt\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt; Yahoo!
