Luckily, wasn&#39;t\nthat painful. Sold the tsuba &#39;as is&#39; for about 2/3\nwhat I paid. Didn&#39;t like it enough to spend the time\non it.\n\nThe only problem with starting a folder of &#39;doctored&#39;\ntsuba is that photography mutes a lot. A friend has\nshown me tsuba from one dealer who&#39;s photos look\nhonest, huge, and scanned in. Then he shows me several\ntsuba from that dealer, in hand: much smaller, and\nsome are &#39;ugly&#39;. I assume doctored, because the I&#39;ve\nseen one before/after that the dealer bought when I\nrestrained knowing the very nice tsuba would require 1\nyear of generally accepted Tender Loving Care.\n\nYou would think smaller scale would mute what is shown\nhuge and 3D.\n\nBut there are lot of tsuba where I can&#39;t tell if they\nhave been doctored. My last lines of defense are\nmaginification glass / loupes and that I&#39;ve got a\nstrong sense of smell and a biochem background. So it\ncomes down to some nice noonday sunlight, a magnifier,\nand a few cautious sniffs (hey, it works. Just don&#39;t\nsneeze.).\n\nCurran\n\n\n--- David Zincavage &lt;jdz@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; Well, when I look at tsuba priced in the high three\n&gt; figues and above on the usual dealer websites, and\n&gt; they resemble $200 Ebay tsubas in form and basic\n&gt; aesthetic quality, but seem somehow peculiarly more\n&gt; beautiful, more magnificent, downright wrapped in\n&gt; glory, like the advantageously lit men&#39;s clothing in\n&gt; the windows of J. Press,  I figure those dealers\n&gt; know something I don&#39;t know about how to gussy a\n&gt; tsuba up.  Just like the guy who photographed his\n&gt; rusty Akasaka tsuba on an orange background, and\n&gt; then sold it to me.  There are special skills and\n&gt; tricks of the trade. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt;   From: steven \n&gt;   To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n&gt;   Sent: Friday, September 24, 2004 1:34 PM\n&gt;   Subject: [nihontostudy] Re: Primped/doctored tsuba\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   Hi Bob,\n&gt; \n&gt;   Yes, this is a great site... :o).  I have spent\n&gt; quite a bit of time here, \n&gt;   and it&#39;s a wealth of information, no doubt.  I\n&gt; think what I&#39;m looking \n&gt;   for, though, is to actually see some good close-up\n&gt; photos of a \n&gt;   waxed, lacquered, or otherwise primped tsuba. \n&gt; Sometimes it&#39;s \n&gt;   easier to understand when a piece is doctored via\n&gt; visuals than  \n&gt;   by desciption only...  Thanks much for the\n&gt; response, Bob.\n&gt; \n&gt;   Steve\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   --- In nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Robert\n&gt; Patterson&quot; &lt;\n&gt;   b_patt@t...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;   &gt; http://home.earthlink.net/~jggilbert/tsuba.htm\n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt;   here is a links that gives step by step on\n&gt; cleaning tsuba and \n&gt;   loads of \n&gt;   &gt; other info  hope it helps     look in the\n&gt; articles section\n&gt;   &gt;                                                 \n&gt;    Bob\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;         Yahoo!
