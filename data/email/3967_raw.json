I \nhave &quot;lurked&quot; here for some time, and finally decided it was time I =\r\n\njoined you all in your excellent discussions.  As a &quot;tsuba man,&quot; I \nhave e=\r\nspecially appreciated the recent activity on this site.  You \nare all so kn=\r\nowledgeable and generous with your thoughts and \ncomments---it certainly he=\r\nlps someone like me who is relatively new \nto tsuba.  \n\nI have very much en=\r\njoyed the Kantei of recent days, and the \nexcellent photographs of tekkotsu=\r\n that Jim has provided.  It really \nhelps to have such images for reference=\r\n.  \n\nFascinating thoughts, too, on the matter of aesthetic valuation of \nts=\r\nuba in pre-Edo times.  Jim&#39;s refereces to the tea ware of the day \nare intr=\r\niguing as well.  \n\nAnyway, I just wanted to introduce myself and express my=\r\n \nappreciation for the great activity on the board.  I will look \nforward t=\r\no seeing more, and to contributing a few words here and \nthere.  Best to al=\r\nl...\n\nSteven\n\n\n\n\n"
