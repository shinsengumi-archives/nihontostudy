Yes, it has been a bit quiet. Jim is still \ncounting chickens, no Hawks ( Sorry Jim :-) and I think will be back on \ntrack in the new year. I am now officially an assistant moderator here \nso if anyone need any help with memberships or spammer or whatever, I am \nhappy to help out, though don&#39;t expect me to answer questions aimed at \nJim LOL.\n\nGreat tsuba Curran, nice work and in good condition overall I think. I \nam about to head out for the afternoon so I will have a better look when \nI get a chance in the next few days.\n\nIt made me look into my folder to see what was there and it was old so I \nupdated it. If anyone is interested.\n\n*http://tinyurl.com/eyntq\n\n*Merry Xmas all\n\nRich*\n*\nCurran Campbell wrote:\n\n&gt;List & sleeping Peter K.,\n&gt;\n&gt;Yes it has been dead quiet. I haven&#39;t had much to ask,\n&gt;nor much that I could help with. I have not heard from\n&gt;Jim G in a while. Is he okay? Just super busy?\n&gt;\n&gt;~~I do have a Higo tsuba question! I recently became\n&gt;the caretaker of a decent Higo tsuba. Currently it\n&gt;would be the only Higo tsuba I own and, alas, I have\n&gt;no Higo Kinko Taikan! It has been the one of the few\n&gt;book I&#39;ve resisted (price) or missed getting for quite\n&gt;some time. \n&gt;\n&gt;Photos are in the CURRAN folder of the group.\n&gt;Link:    http://tinyurl.com/9uucc\n&gt;\n&gt;Size is largish:   8.3cm x 7.65cm x .4 cm at its\n&gt;thickest.\n&gt;Gold and Silver, with extensive silver inlay.\n&gt;Iron condition- very nice. Dense.\n&gt;   It is like the nice Nakane Andy has listed at:\n&gt;http://www.nihonto.us/nakane%20tsuba.htm\n&gt;but the silver chain block work is more involved, and\n&gt;the mimi is raised around the plate, rather than being\n&gt;part of the plate as in the Nakane. Goldwork and Mon\n&gt;in both Gold and Silver. Iron seems a slight bit\n&gt;different too.\n&gt;\n&gt;(1)  How this one would be attributed within Higo?\n&gt;(2)  Approx Age?\n&gt;(3)  Fair Value?  &lt;*least important, but I don&#39;t have\n&gt;a clue on this one, other than Andy&#39;s Nakane as a\n&gt;ref.&gt;.\n&gt;\n&gt;Thanks in advance to all replys. Hope everyone has a\n&gt;good holiday.\n&gt;\n&gt;Curran\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\n*Richard Turner - Nihonto Message Board*\n/for the discussion of all things Nihonto./\nwww.nihontomessageboard.com &lt;http://www.nihontomessageboard.com/nmb/&gt;\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
