It is signed: oite Naniwa Gassan Unryushi Sadakazu Seitan, and is dated Meiji 5 (1872), August.Condition of the blade is what I would call 70% with some rusted areas and scuffing, covering up what we wish to see. My first thoughts were that the mei looked good, but there are questions now that I&#39;ve had time to sit with it. I do not see any ayasugi hada showing but I did find some rather unique hamon characteristics comparable to book examples, so that is encouraging. \n\nThe sword has the so-called &quot;hot stamp&quot; of Sadakazu which seems particularly deeply made. In all illustrated examples I can find, the center portion of the stamp seems to appear on the oshigata, leading me to think that this center portion--design--could be captured by making a rubbing, that it would be at about the same level as the surface of the nakago. This one is not like that. The design is there, but it is set quite deep and one would need to &quot;rub&quot; the bottom of the stamp in order to capture that inner portion. I&#39;m hoping that somebody out there might own a Sadakasu of this period when he used this stamp. If so, how does my description compare with what your &quot;sword-in-hand&quot; has? (I&#39;ve never owned a Sadakazu so I have no experience in judging this feature.) \n\nAs for the mei, I still think it looks darn close to what it should look like. One thing that bothers me is that in Koza (shinshin-to volume) it mentions the &quot;fluidity&quot; of his mei. If I were to pick on anything regarding the mei it would be a little lack of &quot;flowing&quot; in some kanji. &quot;Shoulders&quot; of some kanji seem (very subtly) too square, not gently rounded as I see in the books. Perhaps I should post the mei for opinions but for now, I&#39;ll start this off with the question regarding the hot stamp&#39;s depth of stamping. Interesting sword which I&#39;d love to see okay, but we all know the problems we face with such mei. \n\nRon\nSTL\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
