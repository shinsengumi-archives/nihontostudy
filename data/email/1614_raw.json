I \n&gt;was told that they are dated somewhere around the third century? My \n&gt;question is where do I go to get an honest apraised value on these items. I \n&gt;am not a collector of this type so have no earthly idea where to seek \n&gt;information. Any help would be greatly appreciated.\n&gt;Thanks,\n&gt;Mike\n&gt;\n&gt;-----Original Message-----\n&gt;From: yamaimojg [mailto:jggilbert@...]\n&gt;Sent: Thursday, February 12, 2004 10:32 PM\n&gt;To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;Subject: [nihontostudy] Re: shinsa question\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Rick,\n&gt;Just saw your question.  As described it sounds like it&#39;s a koshirae\n&gt;that should pass shinsa.  The point to submitting it would be do get\n&gt;written certification of its age, completeness, quality, etc.\n&gt;Whether that is worth doing is up to you.  There should be an NTHK\n&gt;shinsa coming to a coast near you in the next couple or few years.\n&gt;\n&gt;Jim\n&gt;\n&gt;--- In nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com, &quot;nihontochicken&quot; &lt;rick@s...&gt;\n&gt;wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Hi, guys &#39;n&#39; gals, thought I&#39;d drop in momentarily.  Re the thread\n&gt;on\n&gt; &gt; papering koshirae, can I solicit some advice on one of my\n&gt;few &quot;attic\n&gt; &gt; finds&quot;?  The blade has already been papered (sent back to Japan,\n&gt; &gt; papered hozon, nice old polish Eisho era unokubi zukuri, but\n&gt;tired).\n&gt; &gt; The koshirae (not sent) has been assessed by One Who Should Know as\n&gt; &gt; original and correct pre-Meiji, absolutely NSW (Not Screwed With).\n&gt; &gt; Mostly in excellent condition, no wear or soil to the tsuka ito,\n&gt; &gt; even.  I would guess that papering the koshirae would be a slam\n&gt;dunk,\n&gt; &gt; except\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; 1. The saya is dinged up.  Not terribly badly, but far from\n&gt; &gt; pristine.  It would be a bastard to repair, because in strong\n&gt;light,\n&gt; &gt; the &quot;black&quot; lacquer is seen to be black with translucent brown\n&gt; &gt; streaks running through it.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; 2. The kashira is for correct court wear, i.e., it is black horn,\n&gt;not\n&gt; &gt; a kinko match for the fuchi (which is signed, though the apparently\n&gt; &gt; matching tsuba isn&#39;t).\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; 3.  Though the tsuba has the hitsu, there are no accessories, and\n&gt;no\n&gt; &gt; provisions for any in the saya.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Sooooooo, would there be any real point to submitting this to\n&gt; &gt; shinsa?  It is pre-Meiji original, but no &quot;knock your socks off&quot;.\n&gt; &gt; Just wondering, in case a shinsa shows up again on the US west\n&gt;coast\n&gt; &gt; in my lifetime!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; NC  ;o)\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   _____\n&gt;\n&gt;Yahoo!
