More important though, would be to jump at any opportunity to actually &quot;see&quot; first-hand, truly first class iron tsuba and to let your mind absorb (even subconsciously) what you are seeing. The Higo display and Jim Gilbert&#39;s sukashi display (which I missed) in Chicago was super! These days, each show has similar displays for us to enjoy. I believe Bill Miller did one on Satsuma tsuba last Tampa show. Check out those &quot;high dollar&quot; tsuba on dealers&#39; tables. San Francisco had a fair number of Juyo tsuba (and other kodogu) out for sale. Evenually, exposing yourself to this real &quot;art&quot; quality--what&#39;s really fine art--will (hopefully) develop into a better appreciation of iron tsuba, and you will find yourself passing over the hundreds of average works and homing in on that one tsuba that has that &quot;something extra&quot; which your mind is drawing you to. Buy that one! \n\nLong winded yes, but you see what I&#39;m getting at. Personally, I continue to admire lots of different tsuba but when that special one comes along, hopefully, I&#39;ll grab it.\n\nRon\nSTL\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: Curran Campbell \n  To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Friday, September 24, 2004 4:20 PM\n  Subject: Re: [nihontostudy] Re: Primped/doctored tsuba\n\n\n  Hee hee...\n    I fell for that trick too, ... once. Luckily, wasn&#39;t\n  that painful. Sold the tsuba &#39;as is&#39; for about 2/3\n  what I paid. Didn&#39;t like it enough to spend the time\n  on it.\n\n  The only problem with starting a folder of &#39;doctored&#39;\n  tsuba is that photography mutes a lot. A friend has\n  shown me tsuba from one dealer who&#39;s photos look\n  honest, huge, and scanned in. Then he shows me several\n  tsuba from that dealer, in hand: much smaller, and\n  some are &#39;ugly&#39;. I assume doctored, because the I&#39;ve\n  seen one before/after that the dealer bought when I\n  restrained knowing the very nice tsuba would require 1\n  year of generally accepted Tender Loving Care.\n\n  You would think smaller scale would mute what is shown\n  huge and 3D.\n\n  But there are lot of tsuba where I can&#39;t tell if they\n  have been doctored. My last lines of defense are\n  maginification glass / loupes and that I&#39;ve got a\n  strong sense of smell and a biochem background. So it\n  comes down to some nice noonday sunlight, a magnifier,\n  and a few cautious sniffs (hey, it works. Just don&#39;t\n  sneeze.).\n\n  Curran\n\n\n  --- David Zincavage &lt;jdz@...&gt; wrote:\n\n  &gt; Well, when I look at tsuba priced in the high three\n  &gt; figues and above on the usual dealer websites, and\n  &gt; they resemble $200 Ebay tsubas in form and basic\n  &gt; aesthetic quality, but seem somehow peculiarly more\n  &gt; beautiful, more magnificent, downright wrapped in\n  &gt; glory, like the advantageously lit men&#39;s clothing in\n  &gt; the windows of J. Press,  I figure those dealers\n  &gt; know something I don&#39;t know about how to gussy a\n  &gt; tsuba up.  Just like the guy who photographed his\n  &gt; rusty Akasaka tsuba on an orange background, and\n  &gt; then sold it to me.  There are special skills and\n  &gt; tricks of the trade. \n  &gt; \n  &gt; \n  &gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n  &gt;   From: steven \n  &gt;   To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n  &gt;   Sent: Friday, September 24, 2004 1:34 PM\n  &gt;   Subject: [nihontostudy] Re: Primped/doctored tsuba\n  &gt; \n  &gt; \n  &gt;   Hi Bob,\n  &gt; \n  &gt;   Yes, this is a great site... :o).  I have spent\n  &gt; quite a bit of time here, \n  &gt;   and it&#39;s a wealth of information, no doubt.  I\n  &gt; think what I&#39;m looking \n  &gt;   for, though, is to actually see some good close-up\n  &gt; photos of a \n  &gt;   waxed, lacquered, or otherwise primped tsuba. \n  &gt; Sometimes it&#39;s \n  &gt;   easier to understand when a piece is doctored via\n  &gt; visuals than  \n  &gt;   by desciption only...  Thanks much for the\n  &gt; response, Bob.\n  &gt; \n  &gt;   Steve\n  &gt; \n  &gt; \n  &gt;   --- In nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Robert\n  &gt; Patterson&quot; &lt;\n  &gt;   b_patt@t...&gt; wrote:\n  &gt;   &gt; http://home.earthlink.net/~jggilbert/tsuba.htm\n  &gt;   &gt; \n  &gt;   &gt; \n  &gt;   &gt; \n  &gt;   &gt;   here is a links that gives step by step on\n  &gt; cleaning tsuba and \n  &gt;   loads of \n  &gt;   &gt; other info  hope it helps     look in the\n  &gt; articles section\n  &gt;   &gt;                                                 \n  &gt;    Bob\n  &gt; \n  &gt; \n  &gt;         Yahoo!
