I had always thought that these were made of at least 3 to 5 layers of sandwiched leather.  \n\nInteresting to see 2 layers.\n\nJohn\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: Jim Gilbert \n  To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Friday, May 30, 2003 10:38 AM\n  Subject: [nihontostudy] Nerikawa Nagamaki Tsuba FYI\n\n\n  A friend of mine just sent some photos of a leather nagamaki tsuba from his collection.  I put them up at:\n\n  http://tinyurl.com/d2ee\n\n  His description:\n\n  &quot;Attached are the pix of that leather nagamaki tsuba I was telling you about.  It is 3.5  inches in diameter and .25 inches thick.  It is made from two pieces of leather and it appears that there may be a fabric covering under the lacquer..you can see a weave looking design on the edges where the lacquer is cracked away.  This particular tsuba fit on the pole about a foot behind the blade.  There is a four pointed iron guard device that goes in front of it.  I don&#39;t have the whole pole, but I do have all the forward parts.&quot;\n\n  Jim\n\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n        Yahoo!
