Everyone who has joined my tours in the past has\nthoroughly enjoyed having the opportunity to go treasure hunting at\nflea markets, sword stores, cutlery stores, antique shops, etc.  You\nwill go to places where very few Japanese sword enthusiasts in the USA\nhave ever been to!  At the annual Japan Custom Knife Makers Show,\nyou will meet skilled knifemakers as well as Japanese bladesmiths who\nalways attend the event.\n\nNow is the ideal time to make your plans for 2007 to travel to\nJapan where you will see and learn so much to enhance your\nknowledge of Japanese swordcraft, weaponry and history.\n\nEmail me with any questions.  Thanks and happy new year!\n\nFred\nSwordSmith Secrets\nP.O.
