In the intro to the missing kokuho section list in the YNL, Yamanaka mentions contributing to a magazine article on the subject by Alan Schwartz.  He doesn&#39;t mention the name of the magazine the article was published in... for reasons that are now obvious assuming that this is the same article.  The date would be a rough match.\n\nJim\n\n\n\n\n  Gordon,\n  Jim has given you the best lists to pass on, but if you wish to point Mom\n  and kid in the direction of a bit of romance, you should give them the\n  reference to the 1965+/- men&#39;s magazine that had a very lurid article\n  supposedly by Albert Yamanaka with swords from Bumpei Usui&#39;s collection.\n  That piece as a list of lost treasures together with information on when\n  and here they were turned in and went missing. It includes kana spelling of\n  the names of various GI&#39;s who supposed accepted the swords. It is much more\n  fun than a simple list -- but probably  less accurate. The kid would also\n  probably like look at the dirty pictures in the mag and by today&#39;s\n  standard, Mom probably wouldn&#39;t mind. I have a copy, but I can&#39;t remember\n  the name.\n  Peter\n\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
