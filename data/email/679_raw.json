I don&#39;t see why o-suriage would be more challenging to fit than a newly made sword.  But, I&#39;ve never made a habaki.\n\nI had a sword with an old-looking, somewhat crude two piece plain copper habaki.  It was on a sword that was shortened a few cm.  It served its purpose, but it was far from precision work.  \nJim\n\n\n\n  Jim,\n  If anything it would be easier to fit a habaki to an o-suriage blade than an\n  ubu one as the latter might have a nakago that is greatly thicker than the\n  blade itself.\n\n  I have a two piece habaki that is solid gold/silver covered with sheet gold,\n  it looks very old and is of crude manufacture compared with similar good\n  quality late Edo habaki which fit together almost like clockwork. I think it\n  was probably made by a country maker, any thoughts on this would be welcome.\n  Alan\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
