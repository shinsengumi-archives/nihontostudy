But they were not stamped with the\nShowa cherry bloss=\r\nom.  A Showa stamp, also the nearly as common Seki\nstamp, indicates the bla=\r\nde is not completely traditionally made.  In\nsome better examples that look=\r\n very traditional, displaying both hada\nand water tempered hamon, the stamp=\r\n indicates it was made with western\nstyle steel instead of the traditional =\r\ntamahagane.\n\nNC\n\n--- In nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com, &quot;mark sala&quot; &lt;franzkaf=\r\nka19@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Yes this is true. Old mounts removed and new military =\r\nmounts as\nreplacements. Reason for this is to make the sword SHOWA. I have\n=\r\nseveral, well more than several.
