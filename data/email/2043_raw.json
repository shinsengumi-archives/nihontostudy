Will try soon.\n\nThe tsuba image was definitely much more batlike WITH\nhorns. Without looking too far, I found a similar one\nin Hawley&#39;s Tsuba of Southern California book (page\n116, tsuba 569). This one is much more clearly the Nue\nof the Yorimasa story.\n\nI felt the friend&#39;s tsuba was more likely the Chinese\nGod of Archery, but am now unsure. I have not found\nany comparable images of the Chinese God of Archery on\nthe web, and need to see his tsuba again to be sure\nmemory has the right mental snapshot of the tsuba.\n\n\nCurran\n \n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nNew and Improved Yahoo!
