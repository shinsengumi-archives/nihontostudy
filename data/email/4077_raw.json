While reading up on Yagyu tsuba in \n&gt; the &#39;=\r\nSelected Fine Japanese Swords from European NBTHK Collections&#39; \nI \n&gt; ran ac=\r\nross an interesting reference to Yagyu Yoshikane Renya (1625-\n&gt; 94) who is =\r\nthe founder of the Yagyu style of sword guards.  \n&gt; Apparently after retiri=\r\nng from being the fourth master of the \nschool \n&gt; he set about the design o=\r\nf tsuba, having them crafted by many \nleading \n&gt; Owari tsubako of the day. =\r\n His workshop was located in the village \nof \n&gt; Kobayashi, south of Nagoya =\r\nCastle, and he took the priest name of \n&gt; Kobayashi Osho.  Now anyone who i=\r\ns into Star Trek knows of the \nfamous \n&gt; Kobayashi Maru Scenerio, which is =\r\na test of an officer candidates \n&gt; character in the face of certain defeat/=\r\ndeath.  &#39;No killing, no \ngain, \n&gt; no win, no lose -- the sword of Shinkage =\r\nRyu is not the sword style \n&gt; of outside but the style of inside -- no form=\r\nal style is our \nstyle&#39;;  \n&gt; Yagyu Jubei Mitsuyoshi from his &quot;Tsuki no sho&quot;=\r\n.  \n&gt; &#39;Admiral Kirk, who had been monitoring the situation from the \ncontro=\r\nl \n&gt; room decides to stop the simulation. The main viewscreen slides \naside=\r\n \n&gt; as he walks into the room. Saavik asks for suggestions, to which \nKirk =\r\n\n&gt; replies that she should pray as the Klingons don&#39;t take prisoners. \n&gt; Al=\r\nl the &quot;deceased&quot; officers begin to rise, the blowers begin \nblowing \n&gt; the =\r\nsmoke in the simulator room clear, and the trainees are ordered \n&gt; to repor=\r\nt for debriefing. Saavik remains and protests that the test \n&gt; was unfair a=\r\ns there was no way to win. Kirk tells her that how a \n&gt; person faced death =\r\nwas as important as how they faced life&#39;;  from:\n&gt; \n&gt; Star Trek II -- The W=\r\nrath of Khan \n&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobayashi_Maru\n&gt; \n&gt; LOL -- I w=\r\nonder if Gene Rodenberry was into Nihonto?\n&gt;\n If my memory doesn&#39;t fail me.=\r\n........ Kirk cheated in the scenerio.\n\nMilt\n\n\n\n\n"
