I do have a (silly) question though, I\nthought that the Dragon was King of all animals, like in China where it\nsymbolizes the Emperor among other things. If this is not the case in\nJapan, could someone please explain the meaning of the Dragon in\nJapanese art ? \n \nAlso in China there are a number of myth. beasts that are &quot;children of\nthe dragon&quot;, is this the case in Japan also ?\n \n- Matt\n\n-----Oorspronkelijk bericht-----\nVan: Mike M. Yamaguchi [mailto:mmyamaguchi@...] \nVerzonden: donderdag 3 juli 2003 17:23\nAan: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com\nOnderwerp: Re: [nihontostudy] Botan and shishi\n\n\n\n&gt;I have seen the botan (peony) paired many times with a shishi on \n&gt;tsuba and fuchi/kashira.\n&gt;\n&gt;I was wondering, what is the connection between the two/what is the \n&gt;theme?\n\n\nThe shishi is considered the king of all animals, and the botan is\nconsidered the king (if not the queen) of all flowers.  The pair\nsymbolizes\nthe best/strongest.  The pairing of lion and peony is a Chinese concept,\nand the design is still seen today among Chinese works of art/craft.\nThe\npeony was brought to Japan from Tang China as medicine, and the flower\nbecame popular among Heian court nobles.  Stylized botan flower became\npopular design motif, including the &quot;mon&quot; crest, by the Kamakura period.\nA\nbranch of the Genji clan in Settsu Province used a &quot;mon&quot; showing shishi\nand\nbotan around that period (ca. 1300), so the pairing has been in Japan\nfor\nsome time.  \n\nThe botan/shishi pair was (still is?) also a popular irezumi (tattoo)\nmotif\namong the yakuza (gangsters).\n\n\nBest,\n\nMike Yamaguchi\n\n\nYahoo!
