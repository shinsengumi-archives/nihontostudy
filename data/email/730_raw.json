The fuchi--all that remained of the tsuka fittings--was of plain shakudo with the motif of (I&#39;m guessing) a &quot;Noh character&quot; and a &quot;closed fan in a holder.&quot; Oddly, this decoration was &quot;pinned&quot; to the fuchi rather than soldered on. Never saw that before! Actually, it was a bit loose and seemed like a careless way of attaching this to the base metal, but it was quite old and done originally and not post-war by some GI. Anyone else ever seen this method used?\n\nRon\nSTL\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
