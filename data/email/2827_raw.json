Since we were talking Akasaka, many of the later Akasaka guards (made in Edo) were lifted directly from work originating in Higo (Kyushu).  Of course there are also general motifs that persist across long spans of time and space.  That&#39;s culture.\n\nThere are extant pattern books for later iroe shiiremono tsuba.  I don&#39;t think that I&#39;ve seen one for sukashi guards, but they might have existed.  But, think about our own culture... there are many common and persistent motifs that aren&#39;t set forth in a pattern book.\n\nThe doubled elements at 12:00 and 6:00 are myoga - ginger shoots.  At 3:00 and 9:00 are of course tea whisks.  On the diagonals are folding fans and linking them all are birds.  The inside of the rim is a very loose kiri.  The groups of three dots that you mention as problematic are a standard part of the depiction of myoga in that period.\n\nJim\n\n\n  It seems odd to me though to think that such explicit copies of so very specific a design, in this case of what seems like less than obvious precise significance (tea whisk + curlew + quadrafoil ?mon? =  ???),  would be produced by more than one, gegraphically-separated school.  Are pattern books of sukashi tsuba known to have existed? \n\n  &gt; The edges of the sukashi show some rounding and beveling, where Akasaka is usually quite sharp and vertical.  The\n  &gt; texture of the iron looks a bit softer and grainier than Akasaka.  The shape of the design elements is also softer \n  &gt; and looser than typical for Akasaka, compare the details with the signed example in the Sano catalog.  Note also that \n  &gt; the seppa dai is wider than that one. \n\n  I&#39;d certainly love to read more of this sort of exercise in connoisseurship.  \n\n  BTW, peering at the two, while appreciating Jim Gilbert&#39;s analysis, and looking at Ron Hartmann&#39;s kakushi-tagane some more, I noticed that both tsubas have a triangular pattern of three dots stamped on the 12 and 6 o&#39;clock dividers around the negative quadrifoil, introducing yet another problematic design element. \n\n  David Zincavage\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
