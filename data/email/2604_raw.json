The origami still attests that the piece is a genuine tsuba, and documents the motif, material, etc.  Agreed that it&#39;s not a very satisfying outcome, but for some pieces there isn&#39;t anything more to tell.  The alternative would be to just reject the item.\n\nYour guard is more interesting than those generic sukashi tsuba.  Saotome seems possible, but the shinsa team must have seen (or not seen) something that stopped them from giving that attribution.  Maybe they didn&#39;t like the tomoe.  If not Saotome it&#39;d probably get a Shoami attribution today.  \n\nI don&#39;t think I&#39;ve seen any recent origami with no attribution.  Has anyone?\n\nJim\n\n\n\n  General dumb question about origami. This tsuba\n  has an old (1969) NBTHK Kichi origami. I know that\n  is the lowest; however it says nothing about school,\n  maker or period. So what&#39;s the point of the origami?\n  Even this great unwashed gaigin geezer would have\n  eventually figured out it was a tsuba :-) What is\n  the point of issuing origami that say nothing???\n\n  Rich S\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
