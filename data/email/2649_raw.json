They are of \na tsuba that I recently acquired in trade. It is in Sasano&#39;s &#39;Early \nJapanese Sword Guards&#39; as tsuba #208. Sasano has attributed his \ntsuba to the 3rd generation Kanshiro.\n\nI do not know much about distinguishing between the different \ngenerations of Kanshiro work, and would like to invite open \ndiscussion of this tsuba. I am curious whether it is an earlier or a \nlater work and would like to pin it down to within 2 generations.\n\nThe tsuba is large with a slight acorn shape to it, meaning that it \nis slightly asymetric with the widest point being at the hips.\nWidth there is about 81mm and height is 85 mm.\n   The shakudo inserts are long, nice shakudo, and asymetrically set \nwith the right hand one set a few mm higher.\n\nThickness is about 3.75 mm at the mimi to about 4mm at the seppa-dai.\nThe tsuba is very precise and finished.\n    Thank you in advance,\n\nCurran\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
