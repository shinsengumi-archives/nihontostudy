It is sometimes a frustrating interest; so often \nthe=\r\nre are no final answers to our questions.\n\nRegards, John L.\n\n\n--- In nihont=\r\nostudy@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Jim Gilbert&quot; &lt;jggilbert@E...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; John,\n&gt; As=\r\n others have said, today it would probably be attributed to \nKatchushi.  Wh=\r\nen I first glanced at the shumei I picked up on the \nsecond character as th=\r\ne &quot;a&quot; =E9=98=BF in Shoami and then on the next \ncharacter as the middle kan=\r\nji =E4=B9=99 from Saotome.  Of course the rest \ndoes not fit either case, a=\r\nlthough Saotome and Ko-Shoami would be \nsomewhat defensible attributions.  =\r\nThe first kanji looks like \nichi/kazu =E4=B8=80 and the last ko =E5=B0=8F. =\r\n I can&#39;t make sense of it, but \nfeel like I must be missing something obvio=\r\nus.  The other character \nat the left appears to be a kao, although I do no=\r\nt know who it \nbelongs to.\n&gt; \n&gt;  I also spent time on your gold seal when y=\r\nou posted it, but \nstruck out on that one too.  I don&#39;t have a tensho dicti=\r\nonary so I \nasked my shodo teacher to look it up, but couldn&#39;t conclude on =\r\nany \nknown tsubako.\n&gt; \n&gt; They&#39;re both bugging me, so if I turn anything up =\r\nI will post it.  \nMeanwhile, hopefully someone else will take a look and se=\r\nttle it.\n&gt; \n&gt; Sorry,\n&gt; Jim\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   A colleage, and collector, has r=\r\necently purchased the sukashi \ntsuba \n&gt;   illustrated in my Photo Album JPL=\r\n and has asked for my advice \n&gt;   regarding its possible attribution and fo=\r\nr a translation of the \nred \n&gt;   lacquer inscription  The figure on the bot=\r\ntom left appears to be \na \n&gt;   kao, but I am otherwise at a complete loss. =\r\n Any \nhelp/suggestions re \n&gt;   either of these requests would be much appre=\r\nciated.\n&gt; \n&gt;   While you are in my Photo Album, I am still seeking some \nin=\r\nformation \n&gt;   on the gold, hira-zogan seal.  There has been a complete abs=\r\nence \nof \n&gt;   replies to my earlier request regarding this.\n&gt; \n&gt;   Grateful=\r\n thanks and regards, JPL.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message hav=\r\ne been removed]\n\n\n\n\n"
