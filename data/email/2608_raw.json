Given the type of &quot;true inlay&quot; on your guard it would probably be attributed to Heianjo.  Your description of a silvery sheen made me think of fire scale, but the close up photos show a heavy layer of wax on the surface.  If it still looks metallic in person, it may be scale.\n\nThere is no sahari there, despite the auction description.  I see only brass.\n\nThere are some types of guard that are found as iron sukashi only, along with other versions of the same sukashi ground decorated with Shoami-style nunome zogan and yet other examples of the same type of plate decorated with Heianjo-style hira zogan.  I suspect that these were not the products of separate &quot;schools&quot; but rather different levels of trim that could be ordered according to taste and budget.  The decoration might have been done &quot;in house&quot; or subcontracted out to specialists.\n\nJim\n\n\n\n\n  For your convenience..........\n\n  http://tinyurl.com/2voxv\n\n  Iron tsuba , katana size  with brass/copper inlay outlining the \n  flower and leaves. There also appears to have a thin layer of &quot; \n  blackish &quot; color metallic material covering the whole tsuba flat \n  surface ( into which the slots are cut into the iron to fit the brass \n  wire inlay ), this gives a &quot; reflective silvery sheen &quot; to the whole \n  tsuba when tilt and view at an angle.
