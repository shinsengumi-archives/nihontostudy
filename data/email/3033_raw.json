You&#39;ve also made the patina uniform - how did\nyou do that??  I have a restoration experience too that is now 30 years old.  I\ngrit my teeth every time I look at it.  I&#39;m happy to put these forward as (a)\nwhat not to do and to tell my story and (b) make a comment about restoring iron\ntsuba.  Dirk, if I send you some images can you put them up on the same\nwebsite???\n\nThe story.  I had a daisho tsuba (now elsewhere) that had &quot;crusty rust&quot; on the\niron surface.  I had read Captain E Johns account (name?? - a very early article\nin English) about cleaning and &quot;had a go&quot;.  I used a scalpel very carefully (I\nthought) to shave the rust off.  I also &#39;picked&#39; rust out of the pits left.  An\nAmerican collector visiting Australia suggested it would have been better to\nclean the rust off by, rather than dig rust out of the pits, to LEAVE THE\nSURFACE OF THE RUST LEVEL WITH THE SURFACE OF THE UNRUSTED IRON SURFACE.  I now\nrealise how important this is artistically when looking at rusty tsuba.  They\nare already compromised in condition, price and quality by the rust.  Now,\nDirk&#39;s restoration has restored an already wrecked piece to something with a\nvery credible appearance, thereby preserving the marvellous zogan work.  It sure\nlooks a treat, but is it kosher to suggest that this tsuba is less valuable than\na similar one in perfect (I mean PERFECT) condition???  I know money isn&#39;t the\nissue, I mean this from an artistic perspective, but in the end it all boils\ndown to monetary value (apart from the fact that in 5 billion years we will all\nbe cosmic dust!!!).\n\nDirk, I have seen this tsuba before and have an image stored from recent weeks.\nEbay???  Po-edo???  I guess it is the same one as I remember looking at the\ncrusty, red rust and gritting my teeth.  It is a joy to see it in your restored\ncondition and I thank you for putting it forward.\n\nBest regards,\n\nBarry Thomas\n(aka Batman)\n\n\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &quot;dirk marshall&quot; &lt;dirkmarshall@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Thursday, June 16, 2005 9:35 AM\nSubject: [nihontostudy] cleaned tsuba\n\n\nCleaned the tsuba I bought b4 and after pictures, I use piano keys.\n\nb4\nhttp://img2.imagebarrel.com/img/05/166/00/rust.jpg\n\nafter\nhttp://img2.imagebarrel.com/img/05/166/00/AEAU8098copy.jpg\n\n\n"
