After careful study a=\r\nnd input from \nyourself, Moses, and others, I realized that I purchased thi=\r\ns sword \nas a piece to study. It has served it&#39;s purpose and I personally \n=\r\nlove this sword. It is in excellant polish, the Koshirae is better \nthan av=\r\nerage and I will put it up on my web site as soon as I am \nable to take goo=\r\nd pictures of it. My write up will include something \nabout the missing Bos=\r\nhi. During the Sengoku Wars, if a tip was \nbroken off for whatever reason, =\r\nrepair the tip (make a new Kissaki)\nand send the Samurai back to fight anot=\r\nher day.\n\nAll is well............Thanks again,\n\nElliott\n\n--- In nihontostud=\r\ny@yahoogroups.com, Richard Turner &lt;ikkanshi@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi Elliot, no =\r\noffence, but do not try to confuse your sword with a \nJuyo \n&gt; or higher swo=\r\nrd unless yours is of the same level. The hamon \nrunning off \n&gt; the kissaki=\r\n IS a fatal flaw, make no bones about that. Swords with \nfatal \n&gt; flaws tha=\r\nt make Tokubetsu Hozon, Juyo or Yashu saku are swords of \n&gt; extraordinary w=\r\north, and a flaw that is fatal can not take away \nit&#39;s \n&gt; history. These sw=\r\nords are typically famous because they are rare, \nor \n&gt; were carried by som=\r\neone important or famous. General swords, made \nby the \n&gt; not so famous swo=\r\nrd smiths, no matter how nice will most likely \nfail all \n&gt; attempts at kan=\r\nteisho if theirs is a fatal flaw like the hamon \nrunning \n&gt; off the Ha or K=\r\nissaki, a Hagiri and the likes.\n&gt; \n&gt; We all learn hard lessons and we never=\r\n like being told that our \nhard \n&gt; earned and well spent money if for naugh=\r\nt, but this is a mugs \ngame, it \n&gt; takes nerves of steel and a firm resolve=\r\n. All I can suggest is to \nget \n&gt; over it and move on. I mean that in the n=\r\nicest possible way. I am \nnot \n&gt; trying to be smart, just realistic.\n&gt; \n&gt; G=\r\nood luck\n&gt; \n&gt; Richard Turner\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Elliott wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I was compla=\r\nining about learning nothing from shinsa (NY 2006)\nother\n&gt; &gt; than a falling=\r\n off temperline in the tip is (maybe) a fatal flaw.\n&gt; &gt; Since I am definitl=\r\ny a &#39;newbee&#39; and I study, study, study, I \nfound\n&gt; &gt; something called YAKIO=\r\nTOSHI. I also studyied the JUYO BIJUTSU \nHIN and\n&gt; &gt; TOKUBETSU JUYO blades =\r\nthat have this wonderful feature. \nYakiotoshi is\n&gt; &gt; of no concern, infact =\r\nan attribute to old, Koto swords.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I am happier to find this out mys=\r\nelf from studying than to have\n&gt; &gt; nothing told to me after a shinsa. What =\r\nthey could have \nsaid, &quot;This is\n&gt; &gt; a Koto blade possibly made by Sukesada =\r\nbut we won&#39;t paper it due \nto\n&gt; &gt; the temperline running off in the tip&quot;. E=\r\nven without paper, thats\n&gt; &gt; money well spent.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Elliott\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n"
