I&#39;ve yet to look through that book for your tsuba but will make a point to do so tomorrow (or later tonight). \n\nI&#39;m not &quot;married&quot; this book but I&#39;ve just recently purchased a Namban book (Japanese) so honestly, I don&#39;t need another. My book came from a Japanese dealer but I can look and see what I paid for it and let you know, in case you&#39;re interested. I&#39;ll check and let you know, okay?\n\nSkipping SF this August -- (sigh) -- since I&#39;m going to Japan in October. It will feel good to stay home for 2-1/2 months after a short (fishing) trip south of St. Louis next week. Will be in touch...\n\nRon\n\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: Curran Campbell \n  To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Tuesday, July 11, 2006 10:49 PM\n  Subject: Re: [nihontostudy] Norisuke / Ron H.\n\n\n  Ron,\n\n  I was not aware there was a Norisuke book.

I&#39;m in the middle of\n  &gt; photographing stuff in prep for our stein club\n  &gt; meeting which I&#39;m hosting this weekend. )Yes, too\n  &gt; many &quot;interests!&quot;) Anyway, I&#39;ll have a look in the\n  &gt; book. No english but photos are pretty good. Once\n  &gt; owned a mumei tsuba which was probably Norisuke\n  &gt; work; Alan Harvie ended up with it. \n  &gt; \n  &gt; Ron\n  &gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n  &gt; From: Curran Campbell \n  &gt; To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n  &gt; Sent: Tuesday, July 11, 2006 10:58 AM\n  &gt; Subject: Re: [nihontostudy] Followup on Owari\n  &gt; Kinko Tsuba and Norisuke\n  &gt; \n  &gt; \n  &gt; Alan,\n  &gt; \n  &gt; The tsuba is very thick and rich shakudo. It is\n  &gt; very\n  &gt; heavy. The gold wire used is also very heavy\n  &gt; guage,\n  &gt; set extremely deep into channels. It has retained\n  &gt; about 99.9% of the inlay, but there is a small\n  &gt; spot on\n  &gt; the mimi where I can see how deep the channels run\n  &gt; and\n  &gt; the gold wire extends all the way into it.\n  &gt; \n  &gt; According to Haynes and one or two other sources,\n  &gt; the\n  &gt; Norisuke line did work in Kinko sometimes.\n  &gt; \n  &gt; I am not saying with 100% certainty that this is a\n  &gt; Norisuke, but there is a similar tsuba out there\n  &gt; by\n  &gt; Norisuke and the more that I look at other tsuba\n  &gt; by\n  &gt; the Norisuke family, the more I see the same\n  &gt; design\n  &gt; elements over and over again. Leaf shape. Flower\n  &gt; petal\n  &gt; engraving. Flower engraving. General composition.\n  &gt; Very\n  &gt; much like a painting, the great number of details\n  &gt; evident in a soft metal heavily carved piece like\n  &gt; this\n  &gt; seem to me a signature. There is some variation,\n  &gt; like\n  &gt; there is a very similar 1st gen Norisuke example\n  &gt; with\n  &gt; near identical leaves, but the main vein of the\n  &gt; leaf\n  &gt; is done in a single track of gold vs the double\n  &gt; vein I\n  &gt; have on this leaf.\n  &gt; I like to figure things out before I submit them\n  &gt; to\n  &gt; shinsa, and sometimes if I am happy enough with an\n  &gt; answer and intend to keep a piece- I don&#39;t submit\n  &gt; to\n  &gt; shinsa. I&#39;d be surprised if I actually got a\n  &gt; &#39;Norisuke&#39; call on this, but as a\n  &gt; newbie-intermediate\n  &gt; having something like this seem to click into\n  &gt; place\n  &gt; has been very satisfying. Yet I may be absolutely\n  &gt; wrong! So if I can stand on someone&#39;s shoulder and\n  &gt; see\n  &gt; further into this.... I welcome the view.\n  &gt; \n  &gt; If you want to take a crack at the other tsuba\n  &gt; that\n  &gt; has been a challenge for me, I will dig that photo\n  &gt; out\n  &gt; too and post it. This &#39;Norisuke&#39; has been the more\n  &gt; interesting piece and horribly difficult to\n  &gt; photograph\n  &gt; given the highly reflective shakudo and gold.\n  &gt; Photography is not a strong skill for me, yet the\n  &gt; devil of a good identification is also in the\n  &gt; detail\n  &gt; of the other one.\n  &gt; \n  &gt; Curran\n  &gt; \n  &gt; --- Alan Bale &lt;abale@...&gt; wrote:\n  &gt; \n  &gt; &gt; Is the tsuba iron or shakudo?
