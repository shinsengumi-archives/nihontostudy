It was popular in the Muromachi and Momoyama periods and then died out rather abruptly.  The problem with uttori is that once the foil is worn through in a spot there is nothing to stop the edges from being peeled back and the foil pulled away from wear.  \n\nThe uttori technique was replaced by various iroe technologies where the metal foils were attached to the base by soldering or other &quot;glue&quot; techniques.  It wears better, but it isn&#39;t quite as beautiful as uttori to those of us who like the old stuff.  Most iroe gold isn&#39;t as thick as uttori, perhaps because it doesn&#39;t have to be so strong to withstand the forming and crimping (and thick is expensive).  Still, some iroe can be rather thick, so the distinction in the technique is in how the foil is attached rather than the thickness.\n\nThere is a series to be found in Goto, Waki Goto, Kyo Kinko and Kyo Kanagushi.  Uttori would point toward Ko-Goto (pre Edo Goto).  The quality of the base metal is one key in differentiating the levels -- true black shakudo at one end grading into a brown alloy at the other. The quality of the carving is of course very important as is that of the inlay.  It is all case by case as many people at different levels copied and modified classic Goto motifs.\n\nJim\n\n\nInteresting to read more about these terms. Going back again to the very minute-sized shakudo dragon menuki that received &quot;Kyo-kanagushi&quot; in Chicago. What had me thinking they might be, shall I say...higher quality (?)...was the use of gold utori on the (male&#39;s) tail and the wiskers. It surprised me to think they (Kyo-kanagushi/late Edo anybody) did utori work. Utori overlay always makes me think Momoyama. Anything worth expanding on here? Just curious.  \n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
