I am sendin=\r\ng this message in the hopes that kenshi and sword\n&gt; collectors who frequent=\r\n pawn shops and sword shows may be able to  \n&gt; help.\n&gt;\n&gt; The sword at the t=\r\nime it was stolen (mid September 2008) was in an\n&gt; unfinished wood colored =\r\nresting scabbard (aka oil scabbard, shirasaya,\n&gt; etc).  It had no tsuba and=\r\n the handle did not close flush with the  \n&gt; scabbard\n&gt; (there was a small =\r\ngap).  The sword felt short, for someone who  \n&gt; normally\n&gt; uses a 2.45 sha=\r\nku blade and it was farely straight.  The signature  \n&gt; on the\n&gt; tang is &quot;K=\r\nashi Fijihara Yukimitsu&quot;.  It is thought to be about 300  \n&gt; years\n&gt; old.  =\r\nThe sword was stollen in Eugene Oregon, though I believe that  \n&gt; it may\n&gt; =\r\nshow up anywhere along the west coast (especially Portland,  \n&gt; Seattle, LA=\r\n, or\n&gt; the bay area) or further.\n&gt;\n&gt; A rubbing of the blade&#39;s tang has been=\r\n attached.\n&gt;\n&gt; If any one finds my sword please contact me at (206)-226-056=\r\n1 or at\n&gt; chris.takahashi@....  If you find it for sale please tell t=\r\nhe  \n&gt; seller\n&gt; you know someone who is interested and you will forward the=\r\nir contact\n&gt; information to me.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thank you for your help.\n&gt;\n&gt; Chris Taka=\r\nhashi\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Looking for simple solutions to your real-life financial  \n&gt; =\r\nchallenges?
