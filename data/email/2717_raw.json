Looking in Toko Taikan I see that Nobuhide is &quot;valued&quot;\n&gt; over 11% higher than Naotane (and Tsuda Sukenao, another example\n&gt; checked). This surprised me that he (jojo saku) would be valued higher\n&gt; than Naotane (saijo saku) or Sukenao (jojo saku). Thoughts on this,\n&gt; anyone?\n\nHi Ron,\n\nAnswer #1 is that different people doing the rating = different\nopinions on importance.\n\nAnswer #2 is that popularity is not always in line with Fujishiro\nratings (or Toko Taikan values), and popularity determines value. \n\nAnswer #3 is that the Fujishiro ratings are in context of\nschool. Nobuhide is a student of Kiyomaro who some thing is the best in\nthe Shinshinto period. So when he gets a Jo-jo it is in comparison to\nKiyomaro... so kind of by definition he can&#39;t get Sai-jo if he&#39;s not as\ngood as his teacher, but his Jo-jo is going to be more important than\nsomeone else&#39;s Sai-jo. \n\nI think between the three it covers the answer.\n\n&gt; Mei was niji mei which bothered me (missing &quot;Taira&quot; in it) but I found\n&gt; out today that Nobuhide did apparently sign niji mei. Oh well, if\n&gt; &quot;right&quot; then somebody got a good deal at that price!!\n\nLucky guy!\n\n- darcy\n\n\n"
