I&#39;m presently\ntaking a College level Japanese course. I swear to god\nthey make absolutely beautiful blades and fittings but\nSHIT they need to stick to one method of numbering and\ngrammar rules. And to truely learn Japanese you have\nto learn Romanji, Hirigana, Katagana, and Kanji so\nthat&#39;s four different languages in one. Oh yea and\nthings that are flat are counted differently than\nthose that are round. What the Hell is up with that?!?\nBest advice get a tutor.\n\nBob R\n\n--- Jinsoo Kim &lt;jinsoo.kim@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Richard,\n&gt; \n&gt; Find the private tutor. That will be the best for\n&gt; you. As Japanese \n&gt; grammar is completely different from English, it\n&gt; will blow out your \n&gt; head. Nice tutor will guide you much better and can\n&gt; amplify your \n&gt; interest about this field.\n&gt; \n&gt; Jinsoo\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n=====\nCheck out &quot;Cowboy&quot; Bob&#39;s Books & Things at:\nhttp://asia.geocities.com/gentleman9/index.html\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nThe New Yahoo!
