This normally does not change the color but removes the grease and grime that collects on tsuba over time.  \n\nI personally prefer to use a soft soap and a toothbrush with warm/hot water to clean the plate.\n\nUnless you over cook it and give the plate a dry look and feel, either is quite an acceptable treatment and cleaning method for iron tsuba.\n\nThe &quot;home grown family secrets&quot; of various compounds and tea solutions is a deferent kettle of fish however.  Most tsuba collectors have their own methods for this treatment.\n\nCleaning the active red rust by &quot;boning&quot; the plate and then oiling and carrying in your pocket or rubbing with a soft cloth is also an old accepted method of rejuvenating and healing the iron plate that has been neglected to restore the patina to the plate, and repair the color of the plate.\n\nI have seen a number of over cleaned iron tsuba however.  Over cleaning can removed the patina and leave a &quot;shiny&quot; surface to the plate that takes a long time to repatinate unless chemical solutions are used to age the plate.  These chemically treated tsuba, that seem to go from a shoe polish black to a brown in color to my eyes never look as good as the original patina that develops with age and use.\n\nThese methods are NOT to be tried on kinko or soft metal tsuba, it will destroy the finish of the soft metal plate.\n\nJohn\n\n\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: Peter A Bleed \n  To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Monday, March 22, 2004 9:51 AM\n  Subject: Re: [nihontostudy] The joy of tosho tsuba\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Hi Pete -\n\n  &gt;...it was also entirely bright.

You showing me yours and I&#39;ll.. .   .\n  Actually, I was hoping that by being a bit coy on this point, we could get\n  some discussion going. There are purists and experts on this list,\n  afterall. I am sure that somebody will object to almost any treatment, so I\n  hesitate to set them off by describing &quot;my&quot; method.\n  In simple terms, tho, there are two options, right? There is either 1)\n  heat at some level OR 2) some &#39;elixir.&#39;\n  What DOES the world think of those options?\n  Pete\n\n\n        Yahoo!
