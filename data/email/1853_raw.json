A collector in Japan has suggested it is \nMITSUTOSHI, KIKUOKA school. I was looking through the Mitsu&#39;s in \nMurtha&#39;s book seeing if there was anything in there and I noticed \nseveral Mitsu&#39;s written in a similar way, even though they are his \ninterpretation in writing, I though they were vaguely similar.\n\nCheers\n\nRich\n\nJim Gilbert wrote:\n\n&gt; Rich,\n&gt; It doesn&#39;t look like mitsu.  The bottom part of the first character is \n&gt; the same as in the bottom part of the gyosho style writing of sada \n&gt; (Self/Hirose 384) and kore (S/H 782), but the upper part of those \n&gt; kanji in gyosho or sosho style are different.  I can&#39;t find any kanji \n&gt; that fit reasonably with a gyosho writing of the whole with that lower \n&gt; part.\n&gt;\n&gt; Looking through the gyosho/sosho section at the end of the Daijiten I \n&gt; find a very similar rendering of AI / chika.  The kaisho style writing \n&gt; of AI is much more complex, but here are two &quot;script&quot; versions of that \n&gt; character in the Daijiten:\n&gt;\n&gt; http://tinyurl.com/37z8y\n&gt;\n&gt; I don&#39;t find any makers listed with the name Airi or Chikatoshi, or \n&gt; under any variations I could come up with, including other possible \n&gt; but less likely kanji.  The tsuba is interesting only because the \n&gt; workmanship is very similar to the many unsigned shiiremono variations \n&gt; taken from Kaneie and Nara styles.  The taganemei also look like the \n&gt; ones on those shiiremono.  Unfortunately there isn&#39;t a place or group \n&gt; name inscribed here.  Given the workmanship I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if \n&gt; the maker has not been recorded, but I hope that someone can do better \n&gt; than me with the reading and research on this one.  It&#39;d be good to \n&gt; pin these things down.\n&gt;\n&gt; Jim\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   Hi Gordon, Rich Stein has suggested, and cleverly so I think, that it\n&gt;   may be Mitsu (robinson 48) in a stylistic form.\n&gt;\n&gt;   Rich\n&gt;\n&gt;   Gordon Robson wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;   &gt; Even in May, this mei is difficult. The second character, as I am sure\n&gt;   &gt; everyone knows is Toshi. No idea on the first one though.\n&gt;   &gt;\n&gt;   &gt;\n&gt;   &gt;\n&gt;   &gt; Gordon\n&gt;   &gt;\n&gt;   &gt;&gt;\n&gt;   &gt;\n&gt;   &gt; All, how are we. I am after some help on this mei please, I believe it\n&gt;   &gt; is ????? toshi, any thoughts ?.\n&gt;   &gt;\n&gt;   &gt; http://members.westnet.com.au/whiz/richard/pics/tsuba-mei.jpg\n&gt;   &gt;\n&gt;   &gt; cheers all\n&gt;   &gt;\n&gt;   &gt; Rich Turner\n&gt;   &gt;\n&gt;   &gt;\n&gt;   &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Yahoo!
