This is a Naval dagger, a dress dagger \nthat was worn by Japanese Naval Officers. They sometime came with \ngenuine tanto in them, perhaps a family heirloom the office wanted to \ncarry into battle, but mostly they came with a mass produce blade which \nwas for the most part practical as a weapon, but not genuine Nihonto \n(traditionally made Japanese sword).\n\nTell the group where you are (state/city) and perhaps someone close by \ncan have a look for you ?\n\nA quick look here will give you a little more info\nhttp://home.earthlink.net/~steinrl/dirks.htm \n&lt;http://home.earthlink.net/%7Esteinrl/dirks.htm&gt;\n\nHope that helps just a little\n\ncheers\n\nRichard\n\nsueb262 wrote:\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt; Hi, all!\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;ve been a &quot;lurker&quot; here for quite a while, just so I could learn a \n&gt; little from listening to the conversations (which I have, thanks!), \n&gt; but now I have a question of my own.\n&gt;\n&gt; When my uncle was billeted with a Japanese family during the \n&gt; occupation, they gave him a tanto. My uncle is now gone, but I have \n&gt; come into possession of that tanto. However, I don&#39;t know anything \n&gt; about it, although I&#39;m trying to find someone to whom I could take it \n&gt; who would know how to identify/analyze it (no luck yet).\n&gt;\n&gt; I wonder if any of you could take the time to look at the pictures I \n&gt; have of it and tell me what you can about it? I&#39;d appreciate any \n&gt; info/ideas about how old it is, what &quot;school&quot; it might be from (if \n&gt; any), or anything else.\n&gt;\n&gt; Here&#39;s the link to my flickr account:\n&gt;\n&gt; http://www.flickr.com/photos/73941163@N00/?saved=1 \n&gt; &lt;http://www.flickr.com/photos/73941163@N00/?saved=1&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;d appreciate any thoughts. Thanks!\n&gt;\n&gt; Sue\n&gt;\n&gt; \n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
