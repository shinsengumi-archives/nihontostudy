Last year I passed up the Shinto \n  volume which had a sword that went with it (it was the one in the \n  Zuikan). Neither the sword nor the book were cheap; both were, \n  however, excellent values. Wish I had bought both.\n\n  Best regards,\n  Ron P.\n\n  --- In nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Gordon Robson&quot; &lt;robsongo@s...&gt; \n  wrote:\n  &gt; Hi all,\n  &gt; \n  &gt; Sorry I was a little slow in checking this out. The Minoto Taikan \n  had a\n  &gt; small sized oshigata and that compared very well. Even better was \n  Nihonto\n  &gt; Zuikan -- yes, if you do not have this set of books, you will \n  never know\n  &gt; what you have. There were two, first gen. oshigata here and they \n  both\n  &gt; matched very well, particularly the katana oshigata. So, my call --\n  genuine\n  &gt; signature of 1st. gen. Shinano no Kami Daido, circa Kanei.\n  &gt; \n  &gt; Gordon\n  &gt;   -----Original Message-----\n  &gt;   From: Ron Polansky [mailto:yamabrp@i...]\n  &gt;   Sent: Monday, May 05, 2003 11:34 PM\n  &gt;   To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com\n  &gt;   Subject: [nihontostudy] Mino Daido\n  &gt; \n  &gt; \n  &gt;   All:\n  &gt; \n  &gt;   I was wondering if someone had a Mino Taikon that had a matching \n  mei:\n  &gt;   Shinano (no) Kami Fujiwara Daido\n  &gt;   http://www.nihontophile.com/Daido1.jpg (nakago rubbing)\n  &gt;   http://www.nihontophile.com/Daido2.jpg (picture of blade)\n  &gt;   (hada is tighter than most Mino I have seen)\n  &gt; \n  &gt;   I was wondering which generation?\n  &gt;   (judging by the sori, etc., I was guessing 1st generation...blade\n  &gt;   looks early Shinto)\n  &gt; \n  &gt;   Thanks for the help!\n  &gt;   Ron\n  &gt; \n  &gt; \n  &gt; \n  &gt;         Yahoo!
