I had a copy for a number of years, but finally sold it. I found the diagrams to be fairly poor and there is a very limited number of smiths listed in the book, so completeness is an issue. Also the descriptions of the works were sparce. In general, I didn&#39;t find the book very useful and I seem to remember that the book isn&#39;t cheap.  A better investment, in my opinion, is some of the larger Zaikans such as the one by Imura, which list a large number of smiths sorted by eras (Koto, Shinto, Shinshinto) and the oshigatas clearly show the hamon, boshi, nakago and signature (and hada in some cases, but it&#39;s hard to do). These can be costly, but they really allow you to verify whether the blade you have is by that smith.   \n  ____________________________________________\n  Doug Blain, Manager, Information Technology Security\n  Computing & Communications Services,\n  University of Guelph\n  Phone: (519) 824-4120 ext. 56475\n  Fax: (519) 767-1620\n\n    ----- Original Message ----- \n    From: David Zincavage \n    To: token_kenkyu_kai@... \n    Cc: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com ; mastersword53777@yahoogroups.com \n    Sent: Wednesday, September 01, 2004 3:23 PM\n    Subject: [nihontostudy] Re: looking for a book\n\n\n    I&#39;m in the market for a copy of the Teirio Yoji.
