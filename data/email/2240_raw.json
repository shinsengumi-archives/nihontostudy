I doubt they could had said much about it because of its condition. Ted headed for the east coast after Chicago (and got stranded with car trouble) and I brought his sword back with me, so I have it here. I&#39;ll sit with it for awhile and try to see what you are explaining here, and will pass it on to Ted when he gets home. Interesting to see both blades together. Your sword was more than I expected. Nice!\n\nRon\nSTL\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: bungotakadasword \n  To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Wednesday, September 29, 2004 10:43 AM\n  Subject: [nihontostudy] Re: more shinsa question for Jim\n\n\n  Ron,\n  I looked at your friend&#39;s &quot; boy sword &quot;..........I am not sure if \n  it&#39;s signed Kishinmaru.\n\n  More like KiOimaru to me ( my other friend that&#39;s very well versed in \n  kanji agreed with me )........not sure about the spelling but it \n  literally means Ghost King Maru  ( while mine  means Ghost god Maru ).\n\n  Did it pass  shinsa ?\n\n\n  milt\n\n\n        Yahoo!
