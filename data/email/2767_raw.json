I&#39;ve always like this &quot;long \nnosed tengu&quot; and have a mask on the wall of my sword room. Story has it that \nif you become a &quot;know it all&quot; and kind of an &quot;instant expert&quot; with your \nswords (not wanting to study or listen to your peers) your nose will grow \nlike the &quot;long nose tengu.&quot; Neat, eh? Of course I have to explain that story \nwhen a new female visitor is around, least she get the wrong impression and \nthink I&#39;m a dirty old man.\n\nMenuki look pretty &quot;late&quot; but interesting.\n\nRon\nSTL\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;Fredrik Persson&quot; &lt;fredmans@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Thursday, April 07, 2005 4:08 PM\nSubject: Re: [nihontostudy] Help Kantei a set of fittings\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Ron and readers,\n&gt;\n&gt; It seems like your impression has its followers. Someone on Rich Turners\n&gt; message board agreed on Mino Goto, and they are probably made from the\n&gt; same hand. However he also said the set had been cleaned and should be\n&gt; repatinated by an expert. I donï¿½t see the damage but what do I know.:)\n&gt; I decided to take photos of the menukis as well. However they do not\n&gt; seem to match the rest of the fittings. What is your opinion on them?\n&gt;\n&gt; Here is the menukis.\n&gt; http://hem.bredband.net/odrike/Menuki2.htm\n&gt;\n&gt; Here is the rest of the fittings again.\n&gt; http://hem.bredband.net/odrike/Tosogu1.htm\n&gt;\n&gt; Fredrik\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Ron Hartmann wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Fredrik -\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Not having the pictures in front of me at this moment, my impression \n&gt;&gt;earlier was that they were the work of Mino Goto, same period.

There are some made much lower quality and \n&gt;&gt; then some that are a step above these. Notice the rounded punchings \n&gt;&gt; around the nakago-ana; your tsuba has three at top and seven at the \n&gt;&gt; bottom. Most of these kind have these punchings but I seem to recall most \n&gt;&gt; have five at the bottom, not seven. I&#39;m not so sure if anyone has ever \n&gt;&gt; come up with a reliable answer as to the meaning of these punchings but \n&gt;&gt; certainly, these Mino-Goto works do carry them. Age? I think these are \n&gt;&gt; still considered middle Edo works, but correct me if I&#39;m wrong. Your \n&gt;&gt; fittings do look very nice.\n&gt;&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;&gt;  &gt;Ron\n&gt;&gt;  &gt;STL\n&gt;&gt;  &gt;  ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt;&gt;  &gt;  From: Fredrik Persson\n&gt;&gt;  &gt;  To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;&gt;  &gt;  Sent: Wednesday, April 06, 2005 2:55 AM\n&gt;&gt;  &gt;  Subject: [nihontostudy] Help Kantei a set of fittings\n&gt;&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;&gt;  &gt;  Hi,\n&gt;&gt;  &gt;  I would like to have some help with this set of fittings.
