The manner in which the tsuba is &quot;dished out&quot; with the plate \nnarrower at the center and then gradually thickening towards the rim is \nthe first strong identification feature. Next, the obvious hammer work, \ngiving the tsuba both a wonderful texture and great strength is another \nstrong feature, along with the beaten over rim. The deep purple, black \ncolor and the shallow carvings are also very strong features of this \nartist&#39;s work. The soft rounding of the work in the surface is also \nclassic for this man. The mokko shape is also typical of this worker. \nThe combination of small and large filled hitsu indicate a fairly early \nguard -- late Muromachi to Momoyama period. The particularly small \nkogai hitsu would go well with Ko-Mino kogai, some of which are \nextremely narrow. Given these attributes and the early date, there is \nonly one possible maker and that is Nobuie. I suspect it has a juyo \nrating as well. A wonderful piece.\n\nGordon\n\nOn 2006/03/17, at 13:58, steven wrote:\n\n&gt; Nobuiye is my vote...\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Jim Gilbert&quot; &lt;jggilbert@...&gt; \n&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; The photos for kantei problem number three can be viewed here:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; http://ph.groups.yahoo.com/group/nihontostudy/photos/browse/3108\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Jim\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
