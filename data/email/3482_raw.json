I know little\nabout Buddhism, am not much into comparative religion,\nor religious symbology, etc. This is all very much\narmchair commentary, so everyone feel free to correct\nme....\n\nYour clockwise swastika:        Nazi symbol\nYour counter-clockwise symbol:  Occurs both in\nBuddhism and \n                               Southwest American\nIndian symbol\n\nYou will see it on the neck of some Budda statues ,\nright in the little divet between the collar bones.\nMeaning? I am not sure. Memory says to me something\nabout the 10,000 lives or 10,000 incarnations of\nBudda? Someone with a copy of Joly want to help?\n     Memory also says it showed up in Southwest\nAmerican items. I can&#39;t name the tribes or give you\nmuch more than that. I also believe it was adopted by\nour US Military from the Indians and used by troops\nuntil it became associated with the Nazi party and was\n&#39;discontinued&#39; by the US. This last bit may be\n(hystorical myth). I believe most of this is from a\ndocumentary or TV show about Southwest Indian culture\n(cliff/cave dwelling?) I saw about 15 years ago. Some\nof those historical shows stretch the truth a good\nbit.\n\nAs for examples, there are many.\n\nSee tsuba G0016\nhttp://www.nona.dti.ne.jp/~sword/tsuba.htm\n\nAnother off the top of my head is the complete black\nand silver Daisho koshirae in the back of the Hahn Bin\nSiong book. Lovely koshirae. Swastikas galore over\neverything on them.\n\nIn short, it is a buddhist thing as far as I have\nbothered learning to date. If someone has a copy of\nJoly or is more familiar with Buddhist imagery than\nme, please add.\n\nCurran\n\n\n\n--- pac0datac0 &lt;Pac0daTac0@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; Thanks for the info. I still haven&#39;t been able to\n&gt; find any tsubas with \n&gt; swastikas on them. Anyone know of any links to sites\n&gt; that might \n&gt; discuss the symbolism of swastikas on the katana\n&gt; tsuba?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________ \nYahoo!
