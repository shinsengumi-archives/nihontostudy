The only feature that may be considered c=\r\nommon to \n&gt; them both is some evidence of a Chinese influence.  However, wh=\r\nile \n&gt; with Namban tsuba this resulted in a completely novel metalworking \n=\r\n&gt; technique, Soten tsuba use conventional, Japanese techniques to \n&gt; illust=\r\nrate historical sujects which may be of Chinese derivation.  \n&gt; But there a=\r\n lots of differences:-\n&gt; \n&gt; Soten tsuba came initially from a recognised &#39;s=\r\nchool&#39; of makers, \n&gt; although they were later mass produced outside this.  =\r\nThere was \nnever \n&gt; a recognised Namban &#39;school&#39;, the namban influence bein=\r\ng ubiquitous.\n&gt; \n&gt; Namban tsuba had their origin in China, were imported in=\r\nto Japan at \n&gt; the end of the C16, and reached the peak of their popularity=\r\n in the \n&gt; late C18.  Soten tsuba date from the early C18 and continued to =\r\nbe \n&gt; made, as poor quality shiiremono, into the late Edo period.  \n&gt; (Alth=\r\nough I have no evidence for this, I suspect that many of the \n&gt; latter may =\r\nalso have been produced using the &#39;lost wax&#39; method of \n&gt; casting.)\n&gt; \n&gt; Tr=\r\nue examples of the Namban group are characterised by extensive \n&gt; openwork =\r\nand undercutting, whereas with Soten tsuba, while they may \n&gt; demonstrate s=\r\nome degree of openwork, this is not a constant feature \n&gt; and never include=\r\ns undercutting.\n&gt; \n&gt; Namban tsuba commonly have profuse gold decoration, ei=\r\nther as \nnunome-\n&gt; zogan or fire gilding.  Soten tsuba are characterised by=\r\n selective \n&gt; and delicate inlays of gold, silver, copper and shakudo.\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n Soten tsuba do not demonstrate the decorartive mimi, seppa-dai and \n&gt; ryo-=\r\nhitsu which characterise Namban tsuba.  Signatures, although \n&gt; admittedly =\r\nusually gimei, feature frequently on Soten tsuba and \n&gt; almost never in the=\r\n Namban group.\n&gt; \n&gt; The design on Soten tsuba is themed, being is represent=\r\native of \n&gt; specific characters or incidents, while that on Namban tsuba is=\r\n \n&gt; purely decorative. \n&gt; \n&gt; No, I personally know of no relationship betwe=\r\nen the two groups.\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards, John L.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nihontostudy@yahoog=\r\nroups.com, &quot;Elliott&quot; &lt;elliott@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; First, I appreciate all the =\r\ncomments that were made in reference \nto \n&gt; my \n&gt; &gt; question about &#39;cast&#39; t=\r\nsuba.
