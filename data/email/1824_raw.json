It comes up every so often, but there\ndoes not seem to be enough material - either documentary or material - to\nput it to rest.\n      The book that Ron mentioned is called simply &quot;Sawasa&quot; ISBN 90 400\n9279 6. It was published by the Rijkmuseum in Amsterdam. In addition to a\nbunch of other stuff, it shows about a half dozen Japanese mounted western\nswords. These are either smallswords or hangers and they are NEAT! I would\nlove to have one. Indeed, I have kept my eye open for one of these for\nseveral years, but have not be able to snag one.  I attended a sale at\nChristies in London some years back and watched a beauty sell so I know\nthat they are out there ...  and that i can&#39;t afford them. Most studies of\nEuropean small swords include mention of these swords, but I have never\nseen them treated in Japanese literature, As you point out, Matt, they are\nclearly made with Japanese style, iconography, and techniques. I agree that\nthey seem &quot;Mino&quot; but that scould be simply because of the fine shakudo\nwork.\nI urge you to keep you eye open for these in the Dutch market. Often they\nare called either &quot;Tonkinese&quot; or &quot;Chinese&quot; but I think there can be no\nquestion that they were made in Japan. Obviously, if you find any of these\nthat you do NOT wish to own, I hope you will contact me first!\n      I love finding evidence that Japanese swords havelong been part of\nthe larger world and this seems to be one of those times. These swords show\nthat the world of the17th and 18th century knew that the Japanese were\nmaking some beautiful swords.\nPeter\n\nPeter Bleed\nAssociate Dean\nCollege of Arts and Sciences\n1223 Oldfather Hall\nUniversity of Nebraska\nLincoln, NE 68588-0312\n(402) 472-2891\n\n\n"
