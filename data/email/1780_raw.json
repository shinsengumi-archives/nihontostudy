These were a group of women who\n&gt; during the season were engaged in the planting of rice,\n&gt; but who during the off season made tsuba as a means\n&gt; of enhancing their incomes. These women tsuba makers\n&gt; were excellent metal workers making well wrought tsuba\n&gt; plates that they sold either as finished products or to\n&gt; other schools of tsuba makers to embellish in that\n&gt; schools particular style. This is perhaps the only\n&gt; known instance where women composed a major\n&gt; school of tsuba makers.\n\n&gt; Thanks to Jim and others for their research in\n&gt; bringing this important information to light.\n\n&gt; Rich S\n&gt; April 1, 2004 :-)\n\n\n\n\n \n&gt; Yahoo!
