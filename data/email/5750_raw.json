Light machine oil is fi=\r\nne. Choji oil isn&#39;t pure oil of cloves...it is light machine oil with a few=\r\n drops of clove oil for scent. Don&#39;t use pure clove oil.\nIf you are getting=\r\n too much of a sheen, you are using too much. A few drops on the appropriat=\r\ne tissue, wipe over lightly a few times, and store. You shouldn&#39;t be coatin=\r\ng the blade.\n\nBrian\n\n--- In nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com, Matt Stevens &lt;Mat=\r\nt@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I received this week my polished & mounted in a shirasaya=\r\n, Kogatana from \n&gt; Takano san in Tokyo, made with him in a very enjoyable d=\r\nay working with \n&gt; his forge & filing (a lot of filing!).\n&gt; \n&gt; Showing it t=\r\no family & friends, twice I forgot to say &quot;don&#39;t touch the \n&gt; steel&quot; both t=\r\nimes I cringed as fingers grabbed it. I can tell you it&#39;s \n&gt; cured me of sh=\r\nowing a Japanese blade (albeit a small one) to people whom \n&gt; don&#39;t underst=\r\nand what there is to appreciate.\n&gt; \n&gt; My question relates to protective oil=\r\n. Obviously I felt a little urgency \n&gt; to clean & protect! In NZ we don&#39;t h=\r\nave ready access to choji oil. \n&gt; Looking on the web I found several refere=\r\nnces to using mineral oil (not \n&gt; stocked in NZ pharmacies) or gun oil.\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; After a visit to the local gun ship, I walked out with Remington &quot;Rem \n&gt; =\r\nOil Wipes&quot;. But I&#39;m not happy with the results, possibly caused by the \n&gt; a=\r\ndditives in the wipes like teflon & who knows what else.\n&gt; \n&gt; The polished =\r\nsurface of blade, whilst not exactly dulled, no longer \n&gt; shows Takano san&#39;=\r\ns hada as well as it did. Additionally I now have that \n&gt; multicoloured oil=\r\ny sheen over the surface, but that may be normal?\n&gt; \n&gt; Mineral Oil. Referen=\r\nces I&#39;ve read refer to it as a laxative and finding \n&gt; it in your local pha=\r\nrmacy. Obviously we do things different here in \n&gt; little ol&#39; New Zealand! =\r\nBut I&#39;m reluctant to purchase anything from the \n&gt; hardware store until I k=\r\nnow better what it is I&#39;m getting.\n&gt; \n&gt; Can someone suggest product names o=\r\nr precise details on what mineral oil \n&gt; is in the US, so I can find a NZ m=\r\natch.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks for the help.\n&gt; Matt\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"
