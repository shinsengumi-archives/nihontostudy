Fairly classic design and at 81mm x 80mm x 5.5mm it \n  is a nice size. One of the traits here that I find most interesting is \n  the mimi, and the obvious fold line that appears in it (it covers about \n  30% of the mimi). it is almost like the tsuba was made from a two plate \n  construction, though I am not suggesting that at all. I assume the \n  original plate was forged, then folded and forged again before shaping.\n\n  I cannot nay that I have seen this so clearly before in an Owari guard \n  before ( I will also note that I got it to jump out a bit with some \n  clever lighting etc) and wondered if it was a normal trait in Owari works.\n\n  I really love the iron on this guard, its been well forged and is in \n  really good condition.\n\n  http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6144/5934784209_807a0a2719_b.jpg\n\n  http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6132/5934784543_7aa87f9b4a_b.jpg\n\n  http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6144/5935345246_1aa21c6a64_b.jpg\n\n  Cheers\n\n  Rich\n\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n  \n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
