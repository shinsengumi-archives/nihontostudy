They \nare mos=\r\ntly reserved to attributions by Torigoye as to first, second, \nsome referen=\r\nces to which collection the piece came from, and a few \nfake, etc.  I belie=\r\nve he transcribed them from his own copy for \nLundgren and were notes he to=\r\nok from Torigoye.  That book will be \navailable after I&#39;m gone which is usu=\r\nally being arranged by several \nfolks at any given time so you probably won=\r\n&#39;t have to wait long(LOL)!\n\nPS:  No.\n\n\n--- In nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com,=\r\n &quot;David Zincavage&quot; &lt;jdz@u...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Are you referring to part of the =\r\ntranslation of \n&gt; Torigoe Kazutar=F4: Tsuba Geijutsu K=F4, 2 vol, 144p+111P=\r\n, Nihon \nBunky=F4, Okayama, 1960. published by the NCJSC as Tsuba:An Aesthe=\r\ntic \nStudy? or to other notes?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; David Zincavage\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------=\r\n--------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; This is the original, first edition Japanes=\r\ne printing of \nthe &#39;Nakamura Kakudaifu Nobuie Tsuba Shu&#39; by Akiyama, Kyusak=\r\nu, 1926, \nTokyo, or, &#39;Collection of Rubbings of the Nobuie Sword Guards \nbe=\r\nlonging to Nakamura&#39;.  This is printed in the Japanese acordion \nfolded sew=\r\nn binding style and is practically flawless with age \nrelated soiling to th=\r\ne cover (see pic) with both cover fasteners \nintact.  The interior book is =\r\n&#39;Fine&#39;.  I have only seen two copies \navailable in the last four years and =\r\nthis is one.  The text is of \ncourse in Japanese but the rubbings are the p=\r\nrimary source for study \nof the Shodai and Nidai Nobuie tsuba, not the late=\r\nr reproductions.  I \nwill be happy to include a transcription of the Haynes=\r\n notes from his \nstudy with Dr. Torigoye as to the generation/etc. for each=\r\n page where \nnoted in the Lundgren copy.  144 pgs.
