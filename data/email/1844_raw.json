His website is in Japanese only,\n  but he reads/speaks English and will answer inquiries about\n  books, etc. on his site. Also reasonable prices and shipping IMHO&gt;\n\n  http://www.tokensibata.co.jp/\n\n  Rich S\n\n\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  Yahoo!
