I don&#39;t know whether cutting test inscriptions were initially filed flush with the surface of the nakago or not.  If the inlay was raised at all there won&#39;t be a reference point.  Also, an old but false cutting test or attribution would presumably have the same &quot;depth&quot; as a correct one of the same age.  I wouldn&#39;t take it as a certain test of the validity of an inlaid inscription.  \n\nI heard another tidbit about Umetada habaki once that I haven&#39;t been able to verify.  Their habaki are certainly of very high quality and the construction and finish are distinctive, but I was told that the Umetada were exceptionally good at fitting habaki to o-suriage swords.  I&#39;m not sure what to make of that... anyone have any ideas?  I&#39;ve certainly seen Umetada habaki on ubu tanto, so their type is not strictly developed for the nakago of shortened blades.\n\nJim\n\n\n\n  Wow Jim, these are exactly the pearls I like to hear. Incredible ! When\n  you think about it, it makes complete sense, but I doubt anyone would\n  ever take the trouble to figure something like that out over here. \n\n  Now, we can tell the fake cutting tests from the genuine ones with a\n  simple swoop. Very much appreciated, this info is, thanks Jim !\n\n  - Matt \n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
