That now makes three that I\n  have seen. There is also the dai-sho pair on Hideyoshi&#39;s dai-sho that are\n  go-san kiri-mono sukashi pieces. As Jim notes, the majority were melted\n  down, particularly when money got tight.\n\n\n\n  Gordon\n\n\n\n  ---\n  Outgoing mail is certified Virus Free.\n  Checked by AVG anti-virus system (http://www.grisoft.com).\n  Version: 6.0.538 / Virus Database: 333 - Release Date: 10/11/2003\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
