This advice is based on the assumption that\nyou are going to use a digital camera.\n- Use the highest resolution your camera is capable of.\n- Study the User Manual for a CLOSEUP option use if your camera has the\nfunction.\n- Get AS MUCH of the object you want in the image (LCDscreen or viewfinder)\nbefore taking the pic.  This gives you more pixels on what you want people to\nsee.\n- Take as many pics as you can from different angles and distances.  It is no\njoy to get home and find all your images (or the otherwise best ones) are out of\nfocus or have reflections off a glass case (the camera always sees what the eye\ndoes not!!).\n- Find out how to increase the exposure of your camera if it has the function.\nTake extra images at +0.5, +1.0 or even +1.5 if the lighting is not bright\nenough.\n- Unload and carefully view all images with an image view application.  I use a\nrather simple program called Microsoft PhotoEditor.  It is basic but allows\nviewing at up to 400x but I hardly use any more than 150x - if your image is\nbeginning to pixellate at 125x then it doesn&#39;t have enough resolution.\n- PhotoEditor allows one to rotate and crop images for best presentation and\nviewing so people can concentrate on what you want them to see.\n- Preserve the original images by renaming any image you manipulate with a\nmeaningful name. Resave at the highest resolution possible - the jpeg save\noption in PhotoEditor, for example, should be at 100% to preserve image quality.\n- I&#39;m a rank amatuer, but if you&#39;re a professional photographer I apologise for\nthe imposition...\n\nFinally, don&#39;t post large file sizes to the list.  Put them on a hosting site\nsomewhere.\n\nReply off-line if I can be of further assistance.\n\nBest regards,\n\nBarry Thomas.\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &quot;Kim Ghobrial&quot; &lt;imports@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Saturday, July 09, 2005 11:53 AM\nSubject: Re: [nihontostudy] RE: Question....\n\n\nHi Barry,\nThank you, I&#39;ll take some photos tomorrow and post them for everyone to see.\n\nKim\n\n\n"
