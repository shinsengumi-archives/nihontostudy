From what I can tell \nit was ma=\r\nde around 1943ish by Asano Kanasane I have attached a picture of what \nI ha=\r\nve found on reference. The Mei is to me an exact match of example &quot;C&quot;. \n\nTh=\r\nere is a small chip on the Ho, that is almost not viewable but it is \n&quot;feel=\r\nable&quot; as well as several parry marks on the Mune. The very end of the Kissa=\r\nki \n(approx 1/16&quot;) is broken off.\n\nFrom the sources I have found this blade=\r\n was very probably a showato sword \nmade for the Japanese Army. There are n=\r\no other mounts or anything.\n\nNow I know this isn&#39;t a &quot;real collectable&quot; but=\r\n for the &quot;investment&quot; I made I \nfeel that it would be worth a decent polish=\r\n as I can see a great deal of \nactivity along the Hamon even through the ve=\r\nry light oxidation on the blade..\n\nI will send some photos once I get them =\r\ntaken (my photographic skills are \nmarginal at best) if there is any intere=\r\nst. My skills lay more in the \nmetalworking end of things...\n\nSO if anyone =\r\non the list is interested in helping out an old hammerhead I \nwould appreci=\r\nate it..\n\nJPH \n\nDr JP Hrisoulas, COL NANG (Ret)\nBladesmith.\nAuthor: The Com=\r\nplete Bladesmith\nThe Master Bladesmith\nThe Pattern Welded Blade\nhttp: _www.=\r\natar.com_ (http://www.atar. com/) \n\n************ **A Good Credit Score is 7=\r\n00 or Above.
