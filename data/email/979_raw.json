It includes kana spelling of\nthe names of various GI&#39;s who supposed accepted the swords. It is much more\nfun than a simple list -- but probably  less accurate. The kid would also\nprobably like look at the dirty pictures in the mag and by today&#39;s\nstandard, Mom probably wouldn&#39;t mind. I have a copy, but I can&#39;t remember\nthe name.\nPeter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYahoo!
