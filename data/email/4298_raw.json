From my understanding, there is a relationship in \nthe pre Edo work between Tosho, Katchushi and Myochin that crosses over \nand can blur the lines of separation for these 3 groups. There is a \ntheory that the Myochin family was the creator of Katchushi but in \nreading Torigoye/Haynes they state there is no real evidence for this. \nThe iron is also stated to be better quality in the Katchushi/Myochin \ntsuba than in Tosho so maybe here is something in there that the NBTHK \nsaw that we cannot see in the photo&#39;s ?\n\nThe similarities that this guard has with Tosho though are too close for \nme the fathom the reason it is called Myochin. I think Jim is away in \nthe swamp again so he may not answer. Perhaps Gordon is here and can \nshed some light maybe ?. mate ???.\n\ngood question.\n\nRich\n\n\n\n\n\n\nklepet33319 wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; http://page.auctions.yahoo.co.jp/jp/auction/90318701 \n&gt; &lt;http://page.auctions.yahoo.co.jp/jp/auction/90318701&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; I am curious why this is papered to Myochin as opposed to Katchushi (or\n&gt; Tosho for that matter). I would suppose it has to do with the metal\n&gt; which of course will make it difficult to tell from scans. Any help\n&gt; appreciated.\n&gt; Pete\n&gt;\n&gt; _\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n\n-- \n*Richard Turner - Nihonto Message Board*\n/for the discussion of all things Nihonto./\nwww.nihontomessageboard.com &lt;http://www.nihontomessageboard.com/nmb/&gt;\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
