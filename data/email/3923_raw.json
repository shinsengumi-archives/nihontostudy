They charge that 15%. The ones that\ncharge 10% seem to have higher &#39;other charges&#39; so it\nfeels like I am paying them 13 or 14%. If an item is\nworth less than $300, I almost don&#39;t bother bidding on\nit, becuase the fees will eat me up.\n\nThat said, I&#39;ve never tried buying a sword from Japan.\nBut occassionally a deal or a rare item can be found,\neven with all the fees. I missed out on a nice papered\nYagyu tsuba earlier this year. Even with fees, it\nwould have been about 65% to 70% of what a dealer\nwould charge.\n\nCurran\n\n\n\n--- excelsiorilluminati &lt;excelsiorilluminati@...&gt;\nwrote:\n\n&gt; Hi Rich, I really find fees on top of fees vexing.\n&gt; The $10000 sword \n&gt; was an example only. For me to get something from\n&gt; Japan, I already \n&gt; have 6 or 7% duty plus 7% GST now if I went through\n&gt; a middleman \n&gt; another 8% plus. This would seem innocuous on small\n&gt; purchases but it \n&gt; adds up. If I could get 8% on purchases dealing in\n&gt; millions per year \n&gt; (potentially) and on top of that internal shipping\n&gt; is paid and \n&gt; external shipping is added plus the handling fee of\n&gt; $10 to pay my \n&gt; staff, the 8% is gravy and I would be rich for doing\n&gt; nothing. The \n&gt; 15% you say some charge is just usurious. Maybe I&#39;m\n&gt; cheap but that \n&gt; is a good gaff.

The 1000JY fee\n&gt; is for internal \n&gt; &gt; shipping with in Japan. The issue is, many sellers\n&gt; in Japan won&#39;t \n&gt; ship \n&gt; &gt; internationally. They don&#39;t want the bother, and\n&gt; they don&#39;t pack \n&gt; items \n&gt; &gt; to ship out of the country. The intermediate buyer\n&gt; should handle \n&gt; all \n&gt; &gt; that very well. Mine does.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Of course everything is a risk and dropping 10K on\n&gt; a sword in an \n&gt; online \n&gt; &gt; auction is pretty risky anyway unless you really\n&gt; know what you are \n&gt; &gt; doing. There&#39;s a lot to be said for holding\n&gt; something in the hand.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Rich\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; excelsiorilluminati wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  Hello Nichido, 8% on top of all the other fees\n&gt; does not seem \n&gt; cheap \n&gt; &gt; &gt; to me. If I was to buy a $10000 sword you get\n&gt; $800 dollars just \n&gt; to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; redirect it to me from a seller who could send\n&gt; it direct. Plus  \n&gt; 1000 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; yen to have it delivered to you and the 1000 yen\n&gt; for who knows \n&gt; what. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; What would be the benefit?
