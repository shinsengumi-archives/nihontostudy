The shaft/point is for arranging hair and the hook at the other end (mimikaki) is for cleaning ears.  The same sort of implement exists for women, but often made out of tortoise shell or other materials.  I happened to see an extensive display of them at the Tokyo National Museum a couple of years ago.  You can still buy bags of little wooden mimikaki in Japan -- kind of like Q-tips, but hard and pointy.\n\nThe umabari or bashin was apparently used for acupuncture and perhaps minor surgery on horses.  I was skeptical of the acupuncture idea, but apparently it was done.  Tom Helm had more information on this the last time the topic came up here, so it&#39;d be worth checking the list archives to dig it up.\n\nI&#39;ve heard several alternative stories on the use of the kogai, but none of them were entirely convincing.  If anyone has good sources, evidence or arguments supporting other versions I&#39;d like to hear it.  Multiple uses are possible.\nJim\n\n\n\n  interesting tools in the saya, but what were they really used for.  \n  igotten several different thoughts on this and would like to hear \n  from more voices.\n  doug e.\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
