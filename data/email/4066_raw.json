There is a tsuba \n  on Tokugawa (tsuba =\r\npage one bottom) which has that same look and goes \n  by that description. =\r\n I had not heard that term before.\n  Hope all is well.\n  Pete Klein\n  http:=\r\n//www.sanmei.com/shop_e/enter.html\n\n\n\n  --- In nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com=\r\n, &quot;Alan Bale&quot; &lt;abale@...&gt; wrote:\n  &gt;\n  &gt; I think the first tsuba may be Owa=\r\nri kinko, it has a feeling of \n  early Nagoya work when the quality was hig=\r\nh. The second might also be \n  Owari kinko of the type called &#39;Kozenji&#39;, I =\r\nam not sure what this \n  means as it seems to be a catchall term, is the pl=\r\nate nanako struck \n  over the gold lightning pattern?

My hesitation is that the general\n  &gt; =\r\n  work is very good but not Goto grade. How else might\n  &gt;   this one be at=\r\ntributed?\n  &gt; \n  &gt;   The second tsuba is solid shakudo of excellent color\n =\r\n &gt;   and very heavy. The carving is lush and extremely\n  &gt;   detailed. Desp=\r\nite the thickness of the piece and the\n  &gt;   carving, everything has a smoo=\r\nth roundedness to it so\n  &gt;   that there are no obtruding edges.\n  &gt; \n  &gt;  =\r\n Any help appreciated.
