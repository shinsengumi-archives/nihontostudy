I&#39;ve been trying to do \n    research on it and I&#39;m a little puzzled. The Tsuba has 4 or 5 \n    swastikas (can&#39;t remember how many exactly) carved into the Tsuba. I \n    found out that swastikas are buddhist symbols as well as what Hitler \n    used them for. There are designs of painted fish on the scabbard as \n    well as the handle. Which are also buddhist symbols. Has anyone else \n    ever seen Katanas decorated with swastikas? I was just wondering if \n    someone might have any background info. Any help would be great. \n    Please e-mail me back with any info.\n\n\n\n\n\n    SPONSORED LINKS Buy fine art  Japanese translation  Japanese incense  \n          Fine art inkjet paper  Fine art printing  Fine art appraisal  \n\n\n  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    YAHOO!
