He couldn&#39;t provide a\nphoto, so we couldn&#39;t confirm- though evidence pointed\ntowards it. Several of us had seen this design used in\nbrass hong kongers recently.\n\nJust revisiting the topic openly, -becuase I can&#39;t\nfind the newbie&#39;s email-, here are 2 things that\npopped up and seem to me quite legit.\n\nTsuba from Benson (dead ringer for the design newbie\ndrew)\nhttp://www.bushidojapaneseswords.com/4montsuba.htm\n\nIt has happened that modern kodogu slips through\nBenson (I speak from personal experience, I doubt Bob\nknew and the items were very good. They are the only\nmoderns I own.). This tsuba looks legit to me, and\nmost of what he sells is very good to excellent.\nAnyone care to deconstruct this tsuba as not legit?\n\nThen this popped up on Aoi today:\n(&quot;Jyuyo&quot; tachi koshirae under the Sale section)\n-swashtika- mon on the kojiri.\n\nBoth are good examples of this. Its a belated\nfollow-up. Newbie-gent, you still out there and have a\nphoto of your tsuba to compare to Benson&#39;s?\n\nCurran\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n__________________________________ \nYahoo! for Good - Make a difference this year. \nhttp://brand.yahoo.com/cybergivingweek2005/\n\n"
