We see a lot of Swords that have been shortend during the second world war to fit Gunto koshirae and many of these swords turn out to be high quality items. It is of course dependant on the original swords size as to whether it became Suriage or O&#39;suriage but my question is this. \nWhat is the opinion of Suriage/O&#39;suriage in Japan. \n\nI would assume it is the same as ours and maybe things have changed a bit in the time since WW2 but If I had a family sword that was know to be of quality and by a well known smith, be him Koto or Shinto, I am unsure if I would want to cut the mei off or shorten the nakago by any length to fit into fitting&#39;s to take on the battle field. \n\nWas it not possible to have a tsuka made to fit the sword ? I know there are many Juyo Suriage blade in museums in Japan but they are of course very special and for the most part, very old. Was it more important to the officer that he carried his family sword into battle, regarless of what that required, be it shortening or whatever. \n\ncheers \n\nRich T\n\n\n---\nOutgoing mail is certified Virus Free.\nChecked by AVG anti-virus system (http://www.grisoft.com).\nVersion: 6.0.471 / Virus Database: 269 - Release Date: 10/04/2003\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
