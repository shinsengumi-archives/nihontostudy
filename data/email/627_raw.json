If eBay doesn&#39;t respond I can outbid you all near the end\n&gt; of the sale and either: 1. Retract my bid explaining the fraud causing\n&gt; the house of cards to come tumbling down.  2. &quot;Win&quot; the auction, get\n&gt; wire funds transfer from the &quot;seller&quot;, and report him to the\n&gt; authorities.\n\n&gt; Ideas?\n\nRemember that a fraudulent seller if on the way out has no problem at\nall and nothing to lose with dinging you a negative.\n\nEven if it is not legit, most people do not look deep enough for it to\nregister. \n\nI have three negatives on my account, two from people who tried to scam\nme on the buying side, and one because I left a neutral on a seller who\noverclaimed the item he was selling. I got negatived for my honesty.\n\nAnyway, the point is that it is not worth it to put yourself into a\nposition to have someone put a negative comment on your feedback.\n\nWhomever wins should act sincerely. Petitioning ebay to get a bad\nfeedback item removed is a pain in the rear.\n\nThe auction will be promptly taken down if reported via the link I\nsent. I have had someone take pictures of a ring I made and put it up on\nebay for $13,000.00 and it was taken down after 24 hours.\n\n- darcy\n\n\n\n"
