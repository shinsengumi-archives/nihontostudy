If so--and I have a copy myself but have yet to really &quot;get into it&quot;--it is pricey and (I believe) out-of-print. The only book on Goto I had prior to this large work was the one titled: The 17 Generations of Goto (Japanese text). I have this in both hard cover and soft cover, I believe both being the same inside the covers. It seems very good but as always, so much is missed unless you can read Japanese. \n\nHopefully those who attended this year&#39;s San Francisco show saw the small but significant display of Goto fittings put on by Rick Mantigani and Dan Burns. Absolutely awesome kodogu! Unbelievable crisp and &quot;minty&quot; items of high, high quality makers! This display has been shown the last few years but I really wonder how many people stop to study the treasures displayed. \n\nSome of these Goto fittings--and others--have been included as special inserts (high quality photos and printing) in the Northern California group&#39;s newsletter from time to time. \n\nRon\nSTL\n\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: JapaneseSwords@... \n  To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Sunday, September 21, 2003 4:12 PM\n  Subject: Re: [nihontostudy] goto kodogu study\n\n\n  Lucien,\n\n  The best Goto book out there is Goto Book from NBTHK By: Fukushi Sensei\n  Another good book is SWORD FITTINGS BY THE FAMILY OF GOTO  1440 - 1879 1994.  \n  Sano Art Museum, Nezu Institute of Fine Arts, Tokugawa Art Museum.\n\n  I&#39;m sure that there are other books on Goto fittings, but these two come to \n  mind first.\n\n  Lou\n\n\n\n\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n        Yahoo!
