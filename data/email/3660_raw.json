I have seen many other\n  so-called Japanese swords with serial numbers on the blade, and these\n  were almost all Chinese fakes. For some reason, they think this\n  increases the value or legitimacy.\n  After the war, most of the civilian swords (bar a few identified as\n  art objects) were confiscated, not registered.\n  There is very little chance of tracking down the original owners or\n  history of 99% of these swords.\n\n  Regards,\n  Brian\n\n  &gt;\n  &gt; Hello David -\n  &gt;\n  &gt; Welcome and Happy 2006 to you too.\n  &gt;\n  &gt; If you have a sword with a serial number stamped on it (on the\n  blade) then you have a mass produced so-called &quot;factory made&quot; sword.\n  Sometimes you will find some numbers stamped on the nakago (tang) of a\n  sword, usually two or three digits, which in that case might relate to\n  &quot;assembly&quot; numbers; these same numbers are often repeated on seppa,\n  tsuba, etc. Swords were &quot;registered&quot; after the war and continue to be\n  so today, but the Japanese government never required anything\n  (registration numbers) to be stamped on swords.\n  &gt;\n  &gt; Ron\n  &gt; STL\n  &gt;   ----- Original Message -----\n  &gt;   From: dpoll64\n  &gt;   To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com\n  &gt;   Sent: Wednesday, January 04, 2006 3:12 PM\n  &gt;   Subject: [nihontostudy] SERIAL NUMBERS ON JAPANESE SWORDS\n  &gt;\n  &gt;\n  &gt;   Firstly, happy  new  year and nice  to meeet  you  all.
