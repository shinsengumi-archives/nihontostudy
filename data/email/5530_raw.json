Is this\nas I hope the or=\r\niginal edge? \n* could the saya be an old one since it&#39;s lacquered?\n* since =\r\nthe grip still has the sharkskin, safe to assume it&#39;s late but not VERY lat=\r\ne war\n(when fishskin was abandoned)?\n* the field cover seems to have shrunk=\r\n over the saya. I&#39;d like to see the scabbard in its \nglory. but -  best lea=\r\nve alone?\n* are the stamps in the saya cover more likely inspectors&#39; or own=\r\ner&#39;s?\n\nmany thanks for the patience and help with these queries!\n\nI&#39;ll try =\r\nto load a few pix....\n\n\n"
