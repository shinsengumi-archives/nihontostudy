Please take a look at the three photos of a very nice tsuba owned by a friend of mine. It has a Kaneiye signature which I realize, is a long-shot, but the work is so &quot;flowing&quot; and the treatment, even with the plugged hitsu-ana with nanako, all looks so nice. I told my friend I&#39;d ask for comments on this for him so here it is:\n\n  http://tinyurl.com/u4tx \n\n  Thanks!\n\n  Ron\n  STL\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
