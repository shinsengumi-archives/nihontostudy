Amazing, but true.  Here&#39;s a quote from \nPhysical Metallurgy For Engineers (Clark & Varney, 1962), p.198:\n\n&quot;Sometimes stiffness of a part is an important consideration.  For \nthis requirement, aloy steels do not offer any advantages over the \nplain carbon steels.  Stiffness is determined by the modulus of \nelasticity or the relationship between the stress and the strain \nwithin the elastic limit.  An alloy steel may have a higher elastic \nlimit than a plain carbon steel, but the modulus of elasticity will \nbe the same, regardless of heat treatment.  The solution to stiffness \nproblems (ed. - no dirty cracks from Das Klub!), when steel is \ndemanded, is one of design and not metallurgy.&quot;\n\nSo as far as limiting &quot;flexibility&quot;, the soft core does nothing.  I&#39;m \nguessing it&#39;s mostly a cost consideration (at least in the old days, \njust a carried over tradition nowadays).  Of course, there might be \nother considerations.  Perhaps a low carbon steel core (pearlite in a \nferritic matrix) as compared to an unhardened medium carbon steel \ncore (mostly pearlite) exhibits greater resistance to crack \npropagation and resultant brittle fracture.  I kinda doubt it, but \nit&#39;s a possibility.  Given the very clean traditional tamahagane, I \nimagine the Reference Transformation Temperature (temp below which \nthe steel behaves brittly) is below zero degrees F for unhardened \nhagane and kawagane (of course, hardened hagane is quite brittle at \nnormal room temp).  \n\nI have discussed this sword construction consideration with amateur \nUS smiths, some of whom skip the soft core insertion, and just fold \nforge the blade from the same medium carbon steel throughout, and \nmaintain the result is better than the traditional alternative, since \nusing hagane throughout will yield a sword more resistant to bending \ndue the the higher yield strength of an unhardened medium carbon \nsteel core as compared to an unhardened low carbon steel core.\n\nSo the comments of the Japanese abroad that western swords are &quot;too \nflexible&quot; ring hollow.  If such were indeed the case, it was due to \ngeometry (as ratio of length to cross sectional thickness), not due \nto the difference in the steels.  Class closed, test tomorrow!\n\nNC\n\n--- In nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com, Arnold Frenzel &lt;afrenzel@w...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; Wow!! It is more than sobering to learn what I don&#39;t know about the\n&gt; metallurgical end of things. I have read it twice and if I \nunderstand you\n&gt; correctly you are saying that for a given cross-sectional profile \nand for\n&gt; two blades of the same length and curvature, that the application \nof the\n&gt; same stress, say from a force perpendicular to the axis of the \nblades,\n&gt; and within the confines of their elastic limit, the &quot;performance&quot; \nof a\n&gt; blade made entirely of shingane would be the same as a blade made \nentirely\n&gt; from kawagane. Is that correct?  You are getting no argument from \nme; I\n&gt; just want to see if I understand.\n&gt; To go on for a bit, if the elastic limit of core steel is reached \nsooner -\n&gt; for a given stress - then I suppose shingane performs no function \nother\n&gt; than to reduce production cost, and were it not for that reason a \nblade\n&gt; would be made entirely of kawagane in that its elastic limit is \nreached\n&gt; later and it is, of course, more capable of holding an edge - or is \nthat\n&gt; an incorrect inference?\n&gt;  Just curious.\n&gt; Arnold Frenzel\n&gt; afrenzel@w...\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; On Sun, 4 May 2003, nihontochicken wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Arnold (and Folk) -\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; It&#39;s so good to hear from you, Arnold.  I appreciate your delving \n&gt; &gt; through the massive week&#39;s input to nihonto ramblings and picking \nthe \n&gt; &gt; wheat from the chaff.  I hope I don&#39;t pop a bubble here, but \n&gt; &gt; re &quot;flexibility&quot;, the thickness of the kawagane vs. the shingane \n&gt; &gt; doesn&#39;t make any difference from a metallurgical viewpoint.  It \nis \n&gt; &gt; perhaps surprising that all iron and steels have the same Young&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; modulus (ratio of strain to stress in the elastic region).  This \nis \n&gt; &gt; perhaps amazing, in that, say, low carbon steel (as in shingane) \nis \n&gt; &gt; mostly pearlite embedded in body centered cubic iron matrix, \nwhereas \n&gt; &gt; quench hardened kawagane and hagane is mostly acicular needles of \n&gt; &gt; martensite, body centered tetragonal unit cell.  And yet (to me, \n&gt; &gt; counterintuitively), the Youngs moduli are the same.  For the \nsame \n&gt; &gt; elastic stress, the same elastic strain (bending) results.  Now, \nthis \n&gt; &gt; applies only up to the elastic limit in the gross sense.  That \nis, at \n&gt; &gt; a certain point, soft steel will permanently bend at a lower \napplied \n&gt; &gt; stress than a hard steel.  But as long as neither&#39;s elastic limit \nis \n&gt; &gt; exceeded, the &quot;flexibility&quot; is identical.  As a personal note, I \nhave \n&gt; &gt; read supposed old Japanese comments that western swords are &quot;too \n&gt; &gt; flexible&quot;.  Again, this makes no sense below the elastic limit.  \nAll \n&gt; &gt; iron and steel acts the same below the elastic limit.  The \ndifference \n&gt; &gt; is that, at a certain stress, Japanese blades will permanently \nbend, \n&gt; &gt; whereas the overall harder European blades will not.  Then again, \nthe \n&gt; &gt; European blades may be more prone to brittle fracture.  But this \nvery \n&gt; &gt; much depends on the quality of the individual Japanese and \nEuropean \n&gt; &gt; blades being compared.  But, in general, European swords are no \n&gt; &gt; more &quot;flexible&quot; than Japanese blades, and no Japanese swords are \n&gt; &gt; more &quot;flexible&quot; than any others; it only depends (roughly) on the \n&gt; &gt; cross-section vs. length, up to the point the blades are \npermanently \n&gt; &gt; bent.  And, generally, Japanese blades (hard edge, soft core) \nwill \n&gt; &gt; permanently bend before European swords (spring steel throughout) \n&gt; &gt; will (but, then again, maybe not fracture).\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; NC\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; &gt; nihontostudy-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Your use of Yahoo!
