He was a very pleasant man who had been collecting 3 years and had 25 swords.  They were all Chinese repros.  Every last Mother of all Fakes one of them.  Not a real Japanese blade there.  Having said that, there were a very few that were worthy of the generic name &quot;sword&quot; as they actually looked good.  They had hamon and hada and a passable sugata.  But they were not Nihonto.\n\nJim, I&#39;ll still bet on the basis of your one photo that your cheap estate pickup is a recent Chinese crapper.  It is a hard call without the blade in hand, but here&#39;s looking forward to being found wrong...\n\nBestests,\nBaZZa.\naka Barry Thomas.\n\n\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: atarbaktar@... \n  To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Wednesday, August 08, 2012 2:58 PM\n  Subject: Re: [nihontostudy] Hello: Blade ID Mei att..\n\n\n    \n  I dunno about Chinese repro...shows a decent Hamon...could be a old \n  forgery?\n\n\n  In a message dated 8/7/2012 9:07:45 P.M.
