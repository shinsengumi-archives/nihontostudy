I&#39;m\nnot a fittings guy at all, but wanted a nice pair for a future\nmounting project, and as an example for study.\nThey were described as Goto or at least waki-goto. I doubt they are \nGoto...but am wondering if anyone has any thoughts on the quality,\nschool etc? Are there any identifying marks on menuki that might lead\ntowards a certain school?\nWas really attracted to them because of the fine carving work, and\ndetail. The colour is a nice dark brownish-black shakudo, not like the\nlighting in the photo shows.\nThey are actually nicer than in the pics..with some very fine carving,\nand detail on the toes, ribs, tail etc. Some odd marks on the\nlegs..which are 2 ovals with a small dot in the middle.\nMiddle to late edo I assume? Condition is very good. Any comments from\n&quot;menuki guys&quot; appreciated.\n\nPic is at\nhttp://www.image-hosting.net/images/messageboard/retalt/Menuki.jpg\n\nThanks,\nBrian \n\n\n\n"
