I have seen many swords with Muromachi/Momoyama style koshira=\r\ne over the years, but 99.9% have been 19th c. swords in retro style. Two ex=\r\nceptions come to mind: Victor Harris and I catalogued the blades in the Mus=\r\neum of Japanese Sword Fittings in Tokyo for Christie=92s in =9105. In that =\r\ncollection was a Momoyama tachi koshirae that was later sold in NY, the oth=\r\ner was an itomaki tachi made for an Ikeda Daimyo in Christie=92s London. Vi=\r\nctor has seen this nagamaki and agrees that it is 16th c.  \n\nI think this w=\r\neapon is the first of a number of identical contract pieces for an armoury,=\r\n as it is numbered =911&#39; as are one seppa, the fuchi and the tsuka in ink u=\r\nnder the fuchi, it is utilitarian, with thin yamagane mounts and low qualit=\r\ny lacquer, the nakago-ana are not well made. The long ububa can be accounte=\r\nd for by its lack of use, it may have been polished only once or twice then=\r\n stored for a very long time, this would account for its fairly good condit=\r\nion apart from the leather tsuka binding shrinking and being attacked by in=\r\nsects.\n\nIt may look like a sword but it has the thick saya of a polearm, no=\r\n kurikata and the tsuka is 21.5&quot; long. \n\nAs I stated in my earlier post it =\r\nweighs around 6lbs, this is not something one would want as a personal weap=\r\non, it is too heavy and awkward to carry and I think would only be useful i=\r\nn battle.\n\n\n\n--\nI am using the free version of SPAMfighter.\nWe are a commun=\r\nity of 7 million users fighting spam.\nSPAMfighter has removed 9 of my spam =\r\nemails to date.\nGet the free SPAMfighter here: http://www.spamfighter.com/l=\r\nen\n\nThe Professional version does not have this message\n\n\n[Non-text portion=\r\ns of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
