Fred was leading and Jeff Miller was at \nthe end and I was in the middle.\n\nFirst Fred picked up a sword looked at it and bought it.It was a great \nkoto 28+ inch sword with some rust problems.He felt that he would be \nable to double his money, and did on Sunday.A little bit later, Jeff \nMiller picked up a blade that I had just set down - He did ask if I was \ndone -looked at it, bought it and then walked across the room and sold \nit for a large profit.By this time I was wondering what was going on so \nI stepped around Fred and was leading the group.This time I was going to \nfind the treasure!!!You are right. Very shortly, on swords I had passed \nby, both Fred and Jeff bought blades.After I whined a little bit, they \ndid help me find a blade to add to my collection.\n\nAt another show I remember Fred buying a sword. That evening he took the \nblade to his room and by the next day had cleaned up the blade and \nmountings so that he was able to sell at a profit.\n\nOne show we decided to make the drive together. Coming home was great.We \nboth had bought swords and when we were not driving, we were cleaning, \nor working on researching the smiths, talking about what made up the \nsword and why it was an example of that school.The trips will be much \nlonger now.\n\nHe will be missed.\n\nLater\n\ndavid\n\n-- \n-- \nDavid McDonald            Collector of Japanese Swords and Old Iron\nPO Box 265                      WEB page - http://www.montanairon.com\nSidney MT  59270                email - jswords@...\n406-482-3243  evenings     I do tsukamaki (wrapping of sword hilts)\n\nOwner of White IH Cub&  Super A Farmall, IH 100&  130, 140, AC G\nMcD type M, Monitor, Frost King and other stationary engines.\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
