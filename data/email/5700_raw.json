I&#39;ve come to admire &quot;his&quot; persistence, although he&#39;s probably a b=\r\noiler room somewhere rather than an individual.\n\nI&#39;m afraid that Gordon may=\r\n be waving his cane and yelling at the kids to stay off his lawn before lon=\r\ng...\n\nI had a chance to look at a very interesting tsuba recently.  It&#39;s a =\r\ntypical bird in the plum tree Higo guard, but what&#39;s interesting is that it=\r\n wasn&#39;t completed.  The design is scribed into the plate and all of the rou=\r\nghing out was done with a chisel.  Even the outline of the rim is chiseled =\r\nin with multiple cuts from both sides. It looks like a slight gouge was use=\r\nd while cutting the rim and most of the sukashi was cut with a straight chi=\r\nsel.\n\nA couple of sections of sukashi have some file work done, but the res=\r\nt is still rough.  It looks like one of the thin branches was chiseled down=\r\n too thin to be finished properly and the piece was abandoned.  The color o=\r\nf the guard isn&#39;t bad (even though I doubt any patina was applied) and the =\r\nbuild up on the interior sukashi walls looks about like you&#39;d expect for an=\r\n Edo piece.\n\nI recently spent two weeks shooting in Baja Sur, Mexico.  A gr=\r\neat place, other than the developed Cabo area on the southern tip. \n\nA few =\r\nwildlife photos from both the Pacific and Gulf sides:\n\nhttp://www.flickr.co=\r\nm/photos/jggilbert/sets/72157623839030000/\n\nJim\n\nwww.jimgilbertphoto.com\n\n\n=\r\n--- In nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com, Richard Turner &lt;ikkanshi@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; and I think julius_lopez82@... asked a legit question on Ichimonji ?\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; I had a quick check and Jim&#39;s deleted someone named nicemaletrust who \n&gt; =\r\nkeeps coming back bit thats all I see.\n&gt; \n&gt; cheers\n&gt; \n&gt; Rich\n&gt; \n\n\n"
