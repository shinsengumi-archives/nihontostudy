I don&#39;t know about that seller so I can&#39;t comment about his stuff.  If this is a cast iron copy it probably is modern.  A lot of the modern Chinese fakes do get the proportions all wrong, so it&#39;s a matter of learning about early sword mountings.\n\nMany early &quot;katana-type&quot; mountings had saya and tsuka that were much thinner than what became the convention during and after the Edo period.  Hence the seppa dai (sized to match the saya and tsuka) are small.  The early kozuka and kogai were often very thin, so the ana made to match them are narrow.  They were sometimes mounted at angles slightly off from the later 9:00, 3:00 standard.  Also at times it was the fashion to mount rather small guards on large blades, leaving behind nakago-ana that look disproportionately large.  \n\nOf course guards from these early mountings are pretty rare, so chances are that some misshapen thing on ebay is just a modern fake.  \n\nJim\n\n\n\n  Ron that second tsuba reminds me of some of the stuff being sold on ebay by\n  the guy who used to call himself &#39;mrvtjun&#39;, I think he changed his handle to\n  &#39;po-edo&#39; now or something.\n  I always thought that quite a few of his tsuba looked funky with strangely\n  proportioned nakago and hitsu ana. Alot of them do not have a proper seppa\n  dai either. Anyway judging from that dudes feedback alot of them are cheap\n  modern fakes. He gets LOTS of negatives :-) The rest are low quality 20th\n  century renditions with some original and papered pieces mixed in.\n\n  Could this be such a modern piece also?\n\n\n  Matt\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
