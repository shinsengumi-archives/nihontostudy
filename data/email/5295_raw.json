It=\r\n is often applied to work that is in Goto style \nbut is not Goto main or si=\r\ndeline work.  Edo-kinko used to be used \nsimilarly for work in the style of=\r\n Edo region machibori kinko \nschools, but lately this is generally lumped a=\r\ns &quot;Kyo-kinko&quot; as well.  \nSo it truly is a grab bag, but the problem (especi=\r\nally with menuki) \nis that there is so much Edo period kinko work with no u=\r\nnique \ncharacter to it that makes it possible to give a more specific \nattr=\r\nibution.\n&gt; \n&gt; BTW, generic Edo period kinko work of lower quality than Kyo-=\r\nkinko \nis attributed to Kyo-kanagushi.\n&gt; \n&gt; Jim\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   ----- Original Me=\r\nssage ----- \n&gt;   From: ROBSON Gordon \n&gt;   To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com =\r\n\n&gt;   Sent: Wednesday, February 27, 2008 4:23 PM\n&gt;   Subject: Re: [nihontost=\r\nudy] Kyo-kinko\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   Hi Ron,\n&gt; \n&gt;   My understanding is that Kyo-Kinko =\r\nis the new name for Waki-Goto. \nThis would \n&gt;   make them a grab bag like K=\r\no-Kinko or even Shoami.
