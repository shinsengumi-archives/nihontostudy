It is very\nheavy. The gold wire used is also very heavy guage,\nset extremely deep into channels. It has retained\nabout 99.9% of the inlay, but there is a small spot on\nthe mimi where I can see how deep the channels run and\nthe gold wire extends all the way into it.\n\nAccording to Haynes and one or two other sources, the\nNorisuke line did work in Kinko sometimes.\n\nI am not saying with 100% certainty that this is a\nNorisuke, but there is a similar tsuba out there by\nNorisuke and the more that I look at other tsuba by\nthe Norisuke family, the more I see the same design\nelements over and over again. Leaf shape. Flower petal\nengraving. Flower engraving. General composition. Very\nmuch like a painting, the great number of details\nevident in a soft metal heavily carved piece like this\nseem to me a signature. There is some variation, like\nthere is a very similar 1st gen Norisuke example with\nnear identical leaves, but the main vein of the leaf\nis done in a single track of gold vs the double vein I\nhave on this leaf.\n   I like to figure things out before I submit them to\nshinsa, and sometimes if I am happy enough with an\nanswer and intend to keep a piece- I don&#39;t submit to\nshinsa. I&#39;d be surprised if I actually got a\n&#39;Norisuke&#39; call on this, but as a newbie-intermediate\nhaving something like this seem to click into place\nhas been very satisfying. Yet I may be absolutely\nwrong! So if I can stand on someone&#39;s shoulder and see\nfurther into this.... I welcome the view.\n\nIf you want to take a crack at the other tsuba that\nhas been a challenge for me, I will dig that photo out\ntoo and post it. This &#39;Norisuke&#39; has been the more\ninteresting piece and horribly difficult to photograph\ngiven the highly reflective shakudo and gold.\nPhotography is not a strong skill for me, yet the\ndevil of a good identification is also in the detail\nof the other one.\n\nCurran\n\n\n--- Alan Bale &lt;abale@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; Is the tsuba iron or shakudo?

Big Blue Owari Den tsuba book.\n&gt; \n&gt;   Reading through it as much as possible and\n&gt; consulting\n&gt;   other texts, I feel the tsuba is an unsigned Owari\n&gt;   kinko tsuba by Norisuke or someone close.\n&gt; \n&gt;   Anyone familiar with the Norisuke kinko work able\n&gt; to\n&gt;   comment?
