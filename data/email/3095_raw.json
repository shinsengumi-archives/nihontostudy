Nevertheless certain schools demanded higher standards, among them Yagyu; the Hayashi and Shimizu groups in Higo; and Nobuie, Hoan and Yamakichibei of Owari; while the Katchushi group such as Myochin used traditional forging methods.\n\n  &quot;Forging to produce the jitetsu and that for tekkotsu should be carried out separately.  Each tsuba-ko decides the proportion of tekkotsu metal to use, for example 1-5% of that for of jitetsu.  This is cut into one centimeter pieces, 4-5 mm thick, which are mixed with the jitetsu during forging.  If the forging is not good enough, it can open up later when heated in the process of tekusarakashi, which results in cracks or so called forging mistakes.  Interestingly enough most of the highly valued futoji-mei Nobuie tsuba show those cracks.\n\nThe bibliography cites an article &quot;A Brief Summary of Tekkotsu&quot; in Token Bijutsu #522, July 2000, 9-11 by a tsubako named Kazunari Naruki.  I&#39;m guessing that this is the source for the above comments.\n\nJim\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
