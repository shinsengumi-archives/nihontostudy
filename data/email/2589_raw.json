Clearly you have major issues with\n&gt; the courier you are using and the police should be involved\n&gt; immediately upon any suspicious activity, but please do not besmirch\n&gt; the efforts of the Japanese Canadian Cultural Centre as it attempts to\n&gt; educate people on the samurai sword. Senior members of the JSS/US are\n&gt; active participants in this group and I am sure they are not going to\n&gt; be a party to any activity that does not promote a complete respect\n&gt; for the sword and its history. Sorry to vent, but this was not an\n&gt; appropriate conclusion on your part.\n&gt; ____________________________________________ Doug Blain, Manager,\n&gt; Information Technology Security Computing & Communications Services,\n&gt; University of Guelph Phone: (519) 824-4120 ext. 56475 Fax: (519)\n&gt; 767-1620\n\n&gt;   ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt;   From: samurai@... \n&gt;   To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n&gt;   Sent: Friday, January 21, 2005 11:12 AM\n&gt;   Subject: [nihontostudy] stolen sword alert\n\n\n\n&gt;   A Tokubetsu Juyo Yukimitsu was stolen in transit from me to Japan. \n\n&gt;   Last year a Juyo Token Niji Kunitoshi was taken in the same manner, it\n&gt;   was scanned by someone as being sent to Canada Customs, then it\n&gt;   vanished. There was a several week period in both cases of me having to\n&gt;   fight people who&#39;s computer screens told them something that wasn&#39;t\n&gt;   true, then finally they admitted the package vanished into thin air.\n\n&gt;   Last year they searched the warehouse several times without it turning\n&gt;   up, and when I said I was sending the police over, 15 minutes later the\n&gt;   sword appeared in some office where someone had &quot;mistakenly left it&quot;\n&gt;   after scanning that it was sent to customs.\n\n&gt;   My hope is that the same scam is being played again.\n\n&gt;   Obviously with the cost of a blade like this, it is not a trivial matter\n&gt;   and I feel kind of sick. Insurance says they will not cover it. \n\n&gt;   Pictures of the blade are on my site as I have the paperwork.\n\n&gt;   It has gone missing or been stolen in the Toronto area. Lately there\n&gt;   has been a new study group formed in Toronto with a lot of attendees. It\n&gt;   is possible with the new dissemination of information there that there\n&gt;   is more knowledge about the value of these swords and so we&#39;re going to\n&gt;   start seeing more thefts. \n\n&gt;   Here&#39;s the link to my site:\n\n&gt;   http://www.nihonto.ca/yukimitsu-2/\n\n&gt;   Please, everyone be on the lookout for someone who is asking questions\n&gt;   about an antique sword that they have found, and are trying to get the\n&gt;   value of that matches the pictures and description on my site. If\n&gt;   someone presents it to you in person, please take it and call the police\n&gt;   immediately.\n\n&gt;   - darcy\n\n\n\n\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;   Yahoo!
