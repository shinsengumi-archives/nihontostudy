I got thrown by the use of the different names in the \nsa=\r\nme Sotheby catalog.  One listing would be for Ko Kogai, another for \nFuruko=\r\ngai, etc.  Possibly they had different people doing the \nattributions there=\r\nfore creating an apparent inconsistency.  \nI wish it was as easy to find a =\r\ncopy of the damn book as it was to find \nthe answer!
