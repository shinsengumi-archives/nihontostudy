The Umetada did some kinzogan-mei for the Honami.  I seem to recall another specific group that worked for the Honami but I don&#39;t remember who it was.  I&#39;m sure that a variety of kinko inlaid kinzogan-mei and cutting tests.  Maybe someone else on the list knows more.\n\nIf I understood correctly, during one of his lectures at the Tampa show this year Tanobe-san mentioned that original Honami kinzogan-mei should be slightly lower than the surface of the nakago.  He explained that as the nakago rusts over the years the volume of the resulting iron oxide is greater than that of the iron it developed from.  So the gold inlay stays at the level of the original filed surface, but the surrounding iron &quot;grows thicker&quot; as it rusts.  I haven&#39;t checked it out for myself, though.  Anyone have a good Honami kinzogan-mei handy to check?\n\nJim\n\n\n\n  Gang, I was looking at a sword with a cutting test inscription inlayed\n  in gold today. Part of it had fallen out. \n\n  Now I understand the the inscriptions were done (composed) by the Honami\n  family, but who actually inlayed the inscription in gold and how was\n  this done ? \n\n  Did a smith do this, or a kinko artist perhaps ? Or did they do it\n  themselves ?\n\n  - Matt \n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
