Anyone who has been talking about making books \navailable on line should check it out for the navigation experience.  \nOf course the content is classic, too.  Be aware that every page is \nscanned, even blank ones, so it takes a bit of clicking to get to the \nbeginning of the text... about 19 pages in.\n&gt; \n&gt; Jim\n&gt;\n\n\nJim und all,\nOnce in a while, you can find Cpt. Brinkley&#39;s volumes  in e-bay.\nI got my set there, different editions but the text/illustrations are \nthe same .\nIt is easier to leaf through the actual books than to click, scroll, \nclick, scroll again und again.........\njust my personal experience, of course.\n\n\nMilt\n\n\n"
