I studdied for about 3 years before my back and\nknees go the better of me, I was always taught to be careful fitting new\ntsuba to my sword as the slightest change in the swords balance can effect\nthe cut. I also think that an unbalaced sword would be hard on the arms\nafter say 100 or more cuts. A Katana is fairly hard work with one hand and I\nwould think the lighter the better.\n&gt;\n&gt; Does anyone know if Big Tom is on board or knows about this list ?\n&gt;\n&gt; cheers all\n&gt;\n&gt; Rich\n&gt;   ----- Original Message -----\n&gt;   From: Jim Gilbert\n&gt;   To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;   Sent: Thursday, April 24, 2003 3:33 AM\n&gt;   Subject: Re: [nihontostudy] tsuba balance\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   Rich,\n&gt;   It sounds plausible.  I&#39;m not a sword user and I&#39;m not sure who here is\nor\n&gt;   isn&#39;t, but I wonder how much influence the weight of a tsuba right next\nto\n&gt;   the hand has on the feel or balance of the sword.  Does anyone have\n&gt;   practical experience with how varying the weight of the guard affects\nthe\n&gt;   feel or function of a given sword?\n&gt;   Jim\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"
