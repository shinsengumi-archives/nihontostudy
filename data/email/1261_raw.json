These are as you said, much better quality and they do not have the &quot;full face&quot; pose represented but instead, side views with the primary menuki &quot;toad&quot; looking away, so you get a nice back and back-of-head view. A much more pleasant pair than this site pair in my opinion. Love them! Thanks...made me think of our mutual friend, Bill.\n\nRon\nSTL\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: Jim Gilbert \n  To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Wednesday, December 17, 2003 5:57 PM\n  Subject: Re: [nihontostudy] Unusual Frog / Toad Menuki\n\n\n  Curran,\n  For what it&#39;s worth I used to have a pair of menuki in exactly that &quot;pose&quot; that were signed on the edge Yoshioka Inabanosuke.  They were better quality than these appear to be, and were not what I&#39;d think of as typical Yoshioka group work.  It can be tough to attribute a lot of the unsigned later menuki to a specific group.\n\n  Jim\n\n\n\n\n    Groups-\n\n    Came across these unusual menuki. Figured it might\n    interest some others.\n\n    http://www.l-wise.co.jp/sword/sdata24/clk259b.htm\n\n    Any chance anyone can attribute this ugly duo to any\n    specific school? I&#39;m assuming they are late late Edo\n    or Meiji.\n\n    Curran\n\n\n\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n  To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n  nihontostudy-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n\n\n\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  Yahoo!
