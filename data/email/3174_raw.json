A field described both as Nihonto and Nipponto can&#39;t expect very specific spellings.\n\nDo you know which are the Japanese terms for the &quot;rustic quality&quot; and &quot;quiet strength&quot; so many tsuba vendors claim every tsuba has got, btw?\n\nDavid\n\n\n\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: Barry Thomas \n  To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Friday, July 22, 2005 5:18 PM\n  Subject: Re: [nihontostudy] tsuba school - WABI SABI\n\n\n  David Zincavage wrote:\n\n  &gt; It&#39;s &quot;mud puddle&quot; surface manages to convey simultaneously\n  &gt;  a sense of rustic wabe sabe simplicity..\n\n  Surely you meant Kemo Sabe???\n\n  Ah, perhaps it was WABI SABI??\n\n  HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA...  I just couldn&#39;t help myself, especially after Fred Lohman&#39;s private joke in my inbox.  I asked my wife if she wanted to hear a good joke, as I was wiping tears from my eyes, and she said NO!! - so perhaps I shouldn&#39;t repeat it here for the gentler souls in our midst.  Crikey it was funny...\n\n  Now, on a serious note, I have over the years heard the terms WABI and SABI and WABI SABI coupled.  A mate of mine who has been to Japan some numbers of times says that the Japanese collectors and art scholars he has met do not know the term WABI SABI coupled as we tend to use it.\n\n  My Kenkyusha Pocket Dictionary defines the words as:\n\n  WABI - &quot;quiet taste&quot;.  Nelson (399) gives it as &quot;subdued taste&quot;, but in his listing of compounds does not give &quot;wabi sabi&quot;.  The compounds he does give convey a mood of loneliness, sadness, wretchedness etc etc.  For example, wabibito is given as &quot;lonesome person; unwanted person; poverty-stricken person&quot;.  How does &quot;quiet taste&quot; fit in with these meanings????  The only connection I can think of is in the Japanese theatre genre that there is a nobility in poverty and hard times, so the &quot;quiet taste&quot; is more an absence of ostentation implying beauty in simplicity??  Check the meanings below for SABI.\n\n  SABI - there are two kanji given in Kenkyusha:\n\n  SABI (1) -  &quot;rust; tarnish&quot;.  Nelson (4877) also gives it as &quot;rust, tarnish&quot;.  e.g., &quot;sabigatana&quot; - rusty sword.\n  SABI (2) - &quot;patina; an antique look&quot;  Nelson (1315) gives it as &quot;patina, antique look; elegant simplicity; trained reciter&#39;s voice&quot;\n\n  SABI - Nelson gives a third kanji that is not in Kenkyusha dictionary.  Nelson (4857) &quot;rust, tarnish&quot;, but does not note it as a variant of 4877.\n\n  So this is all about the quiet tonings of nature; the patina on tsuba; the restrained elegance of tea ceremony utensils; russetted iron in armour mempo, do etc etc; the patina on a sword tang...  This doesn&#39;t describe Goto tosogu, for example.\n\n  Now, there is this other word SHIBUI.  I&#39;ve always thought of it as meaning &quot;refined elegance&quot;, or &quot;restrained elegance&quot;, very much a descriptor for Goto tosogu.  Kenkyusha suggests meanings of &quot;quiet, sober, tasteful, refined&quot;.   Nelson (2600) gives - well, let me give the complete listing - &quot;shibu(ru)hesitate, be reluctant; have loose painful bowel movements. shibu puckery taste (of persimmons); sobriety, quietness.  shibu(i) puckery, astringent; sullen; quiet, sober; tasty (in dress).&quot;\n\n  So as we use to us an apparently simple term &quot;wabi sabi&quot;, when we look deeper into it there is a richness of language, and a parallel usage that seems to contradict the beauty and elegance we are trying to describe.  It seems to me then that these words applied to the appearance of iron and lacquer and the decoration thereon have deeper meanings for the Japanese that evoke imagery in their agrarian lifestyle in feudal times, as well as a richness of experience arising from personal relationships in the tight and close confines of Japanese towns and villages.  Bitter-sweet, beautiful-ugly, etc etc.\n\n  This mini-essay hasn&#39;t been a cheap shot at David&#39;s &quot;kemo sabe&quot; - I&#39;m laughing WITH you, David mate, not AT you.  Rather, it was a catalyst for trying to express some thoughts around the usage of these words that has puzzled me for many years.  I might conclude by suggesting that these terms should be applied to those items that have a &quot;high art&quot; recognition within their own culture, however elitist that may appear to some.  Clearly, machibori tsuba would not be described in these terms, but Yagyu tsuba would be along with Goto, Ishiguro, Natsuo etc etc.  Mino Goto would not be in there, nor would mukadezogan (?) - the &quot;toad-skin&quot; or &quot;rubbish&quot; zogan on iron tsuba.  However, very early iron tsuba with shinchu (we don&#39;t say brass!!) inlay would be there (?).\n\n  So, in short, this appears to me to be a swamp which could mire us for quite some time...  Any simple explanations?  Anyone?\n  Best regards,\n\n  Barry Thomas.\n  (Melbourne, Australia)\n\n\n\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  YAHOO!
