There was a several week period in both cases of me having to\n&gt; fight people who&#39;s computer screens told them something that wasn&#39;t\n&gt; true, then finally they admitted the package vanished into thin air.\n&gt; \n&gt; Last year they searched the warehouse several times without it turning\n&gt; up, and when I said I was sending the police over, 15 minutes later the\n&gt; sword appeared in some office where someone had &quot;mistakenly left it&quot;\n&gt; after scanning that it was sent to customs.\n&gt; \n&gt; My hope is that the same scam is being played again.\n&gt; \n&gt; Obviously with the cost of a blade like this, it is not a trivial matter\n&gt; and I feel kind of sick. Insurance says they will not cover it. \n&gt; \n&gt; Pictures of the blade are on my site as I have the paperwork.\n&gt; \n&gt; It has gone missing or been stolen in the Toronto area. Lately there\n&gt; has been a new study group formed in Toronto with a lot of attendees. It\n&gt; is possible with the new dissemination of information there that there\n&gt; is more knowledge about the value of these swords and so we&#39;re going to\n&gt; start seeing more thefts. \n&gt; \n&gt; Here&#39;s the link to my site:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://www.nihonto.ca/yukimitsu-2/\n&gt; \n&gt; Please, everyone be on the lookout for someone who is asking questions\n&gt; about an antique sword that they have found, and are trying to get the\n&gt; value of that matches the pictures and description on my site. If\n&gt; someone presents it to you in person, please take it and call the police\n&gt; immediately.\n&gt; \n&gt; - darcy\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo!
