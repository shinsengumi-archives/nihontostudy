I&#39;ll bring along a pair of ko-Mino menuki that have slight loss to the uttori that makes the way it was attached particularly clear.  Maybe Saturday afternoon before the NBTHK American branch meeting would be a good time.\n\nSpeaking of which, the American branch decided to add fittings study to their meeting agenda.  It&#39;ll be a good study opportunity for sword fittings students attending the Tampa, Chicago and/or SF shows.    I uploaded a membership form to the group file page at http://tinyurl.com/5xeyy for anyone interested.  The topic at Tampa will be Kanayama, Owari and Ko-Shoami tsuba.\n\nJim\n\n\n\n  Another topic which we discussed awhile ago was to understand and recognize the use of gold utori overlay on fittings, what is true &quot;utori&quot; and what is not. \n\n  Jim Gilbert mentioned recently that he plans to be at the Tampa show this year if all goes well. I don&#39;t recall just who all became involved in our on-line discussion of &quot;utori&quot; but I for one, plan on bringing along a few examples of what &quot;I&quot; call utori and also a few examples of what I have my doubts about being &quot;true&quot; utori technique. Keep this in mind and if we can gather a few of us together for a short while that weekend, maybe with Jim&#39;s leadership we could all learn something about &quot;utori&quot; work. I will have a table to sit down at or if not there, certainly a quiet corner can be found somewhere there. I for one look forward to some discussion on this topic!\n\n  Ron\n  STL\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
