If the fuchi kashira really were Goto, they&#39;d probably be worth more than the estimates, but lots of black and gold Goto-esque kodogu of many levels of quality were produced.  Ojime are netsuke/inro-related, not Nihonto-related.   \n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;  ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt;  From: Kim Ghobrial \n&gt;  To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n&gt;  Sent: Friday, July 08, 2005 6:11 PM\n&gt;  Subject: Re: [nihontostudy] RE: Question....\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  Hey all,\n&gt;  I&#39;m not sure what is going on, but every time I send something or reply \n&gt;  to someone, I don&#39;t get any response from anyone.  I kind of feel like I \n&gt;  and my posts are invisible to everyone.  The other lists that I&#39;m on, I \n&gt;  get some type of response from someone, and I don&#39;t feel like I&#39;m \n&gt;  ignored.  If someone doesn&#39;t know, I would like to know this, if I need \n&gt;  to get Photos let me know, but don&#39;t ignore the questions.  There are a \n&gt;  lot of folks on this list which has expertise in parts of swords or full \n&gt;  swords and then there are folks, like myself which are learning from \n&gt;  asking questions and listening to the answers.  I don&#39;t have tons of \n&gt;  money for expensive books, what books I do have, do not cover areas \n&gt;  which I&#39;m asking questions about.  So, please, if someone asks a \n&gt;  question, please acknowledge it, even if it is an answer like, &quot;I don&#39;t \n&gt;  know the answer.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;  In the case of the question below, would it help in getting a photo of \n&gt;  the pieces and putting it up on this list for all of you to see?\n&gt;\n&gt;  Sincerely,\n&gt;  Kim\n&gt;\n&gt;  Kim Ghobrial wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;  &gt;Hi Everyone,\n&gt;  &gt;Sorry to ask this, but I was looking at an Auction, which I&#39;m going to \n&gt;  &gt;see tomorrow and wanted to know if this is something for me to look at \n&gt;  &gt;or not.  Also, if it is okay, if the estimate of $120.00-180.00 is okay \n&gt;  &gt;for this piece.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;THREE JAPANESE COLLECTIBLES: two sword fittings, Fuchi-kashira \n&gt;  &gt;attributed to the Goto School having &quot;kiku&quot; and &quot;kiri&quot; motifs with gold \n&gt;  &gt;accents on black field, late Edo-early Meiji Period; together with \n&gt;  &gt;*ivory* carved ojime, inlaid, &quot;Fukuzuke&quot; (good luck) design, signed by \n&gt;  &gt;the carver, attributed to the Meiji Period.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;Kim\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; \n&gt;  &gt;Yahoo!
