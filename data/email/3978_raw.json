It makes no \nsense that separate steels =\r\nwould be used, so the tamahagane and old \nsteels being reused were the base=\r\n metals used in the tsuba \nmanufacture. this would cause the same character=\r\nistics found in the \nblades to appear in the tsuba. Inclusions, layers, and=\r\n \nnonhomogeneity in the steel itself. In the art sense this would be \nthe p=\r\nrimitivist stage where form came before function. The times \nwere constant =\r\nwarfare and all parts must be robust.\n   Now come the times of peace and fo=\r\nr the most part form supplants \nfunction. Soft iron is a good plate for car=\r\nving and inlay and soft \nmetals become more and more common. No more tekkot=\r\nsu for the most \npart except for the few schools that continue the traditio=\r\nn of \nworked steel.\n    Shinshinto times bring the revival of the old ways.=\r\n What \nappeared on old tsuba was now a favourable thing to copy including \n=\r\nusing steel again and emphasising attributes such as tekkotsu. \nAppreciatio=\r\nn of functional aspects were now artistically \nappreciated. What was functi=\r\nonal had now become raised to the \nhighest form. This happened in the Chano=\r\nyu, Kodo and was almost \ndecadent. I&#39;ll leave that argument for another day=\r\n.
