Hope all is well with you and your family.  I have to \nwonder if sometimes what we think is &#39;fire scale&#39; may actually be oil \nrust which is lifting the oxidized outer layer of the metal?  Also I \nhave to wonder if the effect might be explainable to analogize to \nthe &#39;glazing&#39; process of dental porcalain (I just had to get \ndentistry into this to bug you) which is when you subject the object \nto very high heat for short duration which only melts the surface as \nopposed to lower heat of longer duration (as in a fire) which more \nevenly heats the object.  Something for the metalurgists to ponder.---\n In nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com, &quot;bungotakadasword&quot; \n&lt;MuramasaIII@a...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;  &quot;  yakite shitate = a surface finish resembling the glaze on \npottery. \n&gt; Produced by\n&gt; putting the finished plate back into the furnace and allowing the \n&gt; surface to\n&gt; melt slightly. &quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; this brings to mind about the effect of &quot; fire damage &quot; we \nsometimes \n&gt; see in tsuba................\n&gt; How come some tsuba develop &quot; fire scales &quot; and some develop  &quot; a \n&gt; surface finish resembling the glaze on pottery &quot;  ?\n&gt; I used to have a tsuba with gold nunome AND &quot; fire scales &quot;......if \n&gt; that tsuba was under fire high enough to develop fire scales, then \nhow \n&gt; come the gold nunome did not melt ?\n&gt; Assuming fire scales develop under &quot; low heat &quot;, then can we repair \nthe \n&gt; fire damage  by subjecting the tsuba to high heat , at least we&#39;ll \nget \n&gt; a Hoan look ?\n&gt; \n&gt; milt\n\n\n\n\n"
