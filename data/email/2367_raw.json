I h=\r\nave a lot of books on\nJapanese Swords, but none of them have much on Tsubas=\r\n.  I have a whole list\nof Books that Jim had up on his website, which I&#39;m t=\r\nrying to find out how to\nget some of them.  What books are really good and =\r\nwhere can I get them?\n\nAlso, I purchased a set of Tsuba&#39;s from a Local Auct=\r\nion House in Portland,\nOregon and need to find info on them.  Can we send t=\r\nhe photos on this list,\nor do I need to put them up on my website and put a=\r\n hyperlink to them?\n\nThank you,\nKim\n\n\n\t\t\n_______________________________\nDo=\r\n you Yahoo!?\nExpress yourself with Y!
