Now I have thought it over some more I would\nhave\n: to agree with you and Jim. Would love to find out if they did indeed\nuse\n: an irregular hammer and anvil in the old days, I wonder if anyone else\n: could give us some more thoughts on this?\n:\n: I can highly recommend Graham Gemmell&#39;s book: Tosogu, treasure of the\n: samurai. It is infact a catalog of an exhibition/sale held in London\nin\n: &#39;91 at a big name Gallery.  Very beautiful book with great\nillustrations\n: and very interesting thoughts on the pieces that were on show. Also it\n: just occured to me that none of these pieces are papered, at least\nthere\n: is no mention of any papers whatsoever anywhere in the catalog.\n:\n: Talking about surface finishes, I was wondering about the &#39;cat\nscratch&#39;\n: finish we often see on the back of kozuka and kogai. What purpose does\n: this serve and when did this practice begin? Is it at all related to\n: &#39;cat scratch habaki&#39; that have that texture not only for the beauty of\n: it, but also because it secures the sword in the saya a tiny bit more?\n: Also we often see this motif in combination with a polished shakudo or\n: other ground, sometimes in the form of two triangles, sometimes simply\n: two rectangles next to each other. Is there any reason for this, a\n: kantei point perhaps?\n:\n: - Matt\n:\n:\n:\n:\n:     Z Recruiting Services\n:     &quot;Zurich Toren&quot; Muzenstraat 89\n:     2511 WB Den Haag\n:     T: +31 70 4262273\n:     F: +31 70 4262111\n:     W: zrecruiting.com\n:     E: info@...\n:     Kijk ook op monsterboard.nl, jobbingmall.nl en\n:     nationalevacaturebank.nl voor actuele vacatures!\n:\n:\n: -----Oorspronkelijk bericht-----\n: Van: Peter A Bleed [mailto:pbleed1@...]\n: Verzonden: maandag 12 januari 2004 15:57\n: Aan: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com\n: Onderwerp: RE: [nihontostudy] Ko-Katchushi tsuba.....\n:\n:\n:\n:\n:\n:\n: Matt,\n: You have engendered an interesting discussion and elicited Jim&#39;s\nusually\n: worthwhile insights. Thanks\n: In response to your comments, I took a look again and some of my\n: katchushi\n: guards last night (they used to be so common and cheap that I couldn&#39;t\n: avoid becoming a &#39;collector&#39;). I have always loved the finish of these\n: tsuba which looks old and natural but which is also obviously the\n: creation\n: of human intention. I am not familiar with Gemmell&#39;s book, but - like\n: Jim -\n: I am sceptical about the use of a pointed hammer to created tsuba\n: surfaces.\n: I can believe that a kinko might make and use a hammer with a network\nof\n: very fine points. As I think about it, use of irregular hammer and\nanvil\n: surfaces during the forging of the initial plate might be a means of\n: setting up the internal irregularities we call bones etc.\n: I agree with Jim, too, that whatever means was used to created a\nsurface\n: finish, it probably involved a chisel or punch rather than direct\n: pounding\n: with a hammer.\n: In that regard, let me recall a conversation with Hagawa-san, the\nSendai\n: kinko I have mentioned to the list before. He makes frequent use of\n: &quot;ishime&quot; which is a smooth but &#39;irregular&#39; surface of small dots that\n: looks\n: like a stone (ishi means stone). He told me that ishime is as hard to\ndo\n: as\n: nanako. It is done with specially crested punches (&#39;tagane&#39;) that are\n: struck with a hammer - one dot at a time. Hagawa-san said that once\n: started, an entire surface had to be done in one setting to assure a\n: uniform texture. If the work was interrupted, the piece will be\nruined.\n: Thus, before he starts an ishime surface, he tells his wife and family\n: that\n: they should not interrupt him til the tapping stopped. Maybe the point\n: here\n: is that even if special tools are used, it is still the craftsman&#39;s\n: skill\n: and intensity that matters.\n:\n: Peter Bleed\n:\n:\n:\n: Yahoo!
