Unfortunately, the \nphotographs don&#39;t show it very well. It is primitive, but bold. I \ndid a scan that captured its &quot;spirit&quot; much better:\nhttp://www.nihontophile.com/Sukashi3.jpg\nA big, heavy guard..\n\nThanks very much,\nRon P.\n\n--- In nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Jim Gilbert&quot; &lt;jggilbert@E...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; Ron,\n&gt; The first looks like a typical Kyo Shoami.  Ito guards are usually \nmore naturalistically carved with more detail and sharper edges, and \nthe iron is a bit smoother textured.  I find Bizen Shoami to be hard \nto pin down sometimes, but most examples seem to be more heavily \ndecorated with inlay.  Another possibility is Kinai.  They did \noccasionally do carving that looks a lot like Kyo Shoami and they \nsometimes added inlay metal like that.  Their metal usually has a \nblack finish and the seppa dai tend to be narrower.  They also \nsigned their work more frequently than did the Kyo Shoami.  Given \nthe alternatives, the design, carving, decoration and metal seem \nmost likely Kyo Shoami.\n&gt; \n&gt; The older guard almost looks Saotome, but it&#39;s at least in the \nKatchushi vein.  Given the raised rim and the position of the \nsukashi, I don&#39;t see any sign of it having been cut down.  Early \npieces sometimes have very eccentric hitsuana.  The unusually large \nopenings were probably used with o-kozuka or o-kogai.  There seem to \nbe more iron tsuba with large ana around today than there are the \nkozuka or kogai they were mounted with at one time.  \n&gt; \n&gt; I suspect that in this case the hitsuana, or at least that the \nlarge one, are original or at least the same age as the openwork \ndesign.  Look at how the sukashi pattern is pushed much closer to \nthe rim on the side with the large opening vs. the side with the \nsmall one.  If the original design had no hitsuana, why create that \nasymmetry in the sukashi pattern?  It would be unbalanced even with \na &quot;normal&quot; sized kozuka ana, but the sukashi pattern is designed \nwith just enough room for each ana while keeping the impression of a \nreasonably balanced design.  From what I can see in the photo, I&#39;d \nguess that it&#39;s late Muromachi or possibly a bit older.\n&gt; \n&gt; Other thoughts?\n&gt; Jim\n&gt;   ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   List:\n&gt; \n&gt;   I have a couple of tsuba I was wondering if the list would help \nme \n&gt;   with-\n&gt;   First one:\n&gt;   http://www.nihontophile.com/Sukashi1.jpg\n&gt;   http://www.nihontophile.com/Sukashi2.jpg\n&gt;   (nice heavy tsuba, 3 1/8&quot;)\n&gt;   I think Bizen Shoami or some school related to Bushu or Ito (I \nthink \n&gt;   late Edo).\n&gt;   Any other ideas?\n&gt; \n&gt;   Second one:\n&gt;   http://www.nihontophile.com/KoKat1.jpg\n&gt;   http://www.nihontophile.com/KoKat2.jpg\n&gt;   (very thin, slightly under 3&quot;. purplish iron with remnants of \nlacquer \n&gt;   on the plate)\n&gt;   I think Ko-Katchushi. pre-Edo to Momoyama.\n&gt;   Is the kozuka ana original? It is huge...\n&gt; \n&gt;   Thanks for looking,\n&gt;   Ron P.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
