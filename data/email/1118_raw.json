I&#39;ve had a \nfew contact me about auctions, etc., and I always refer them to the lists for \nmore information.  I&#39;m not sure if any of them ever join but it is worth the \nshot.\nThe real problem of this hobby is the expense.  You have to have a good \nincome and a good deal of time to learn.  Most young people don&#39;t have the money or \ncare to spend the time to learn (and I&#39;m not some old man bashing young \npeople, I&#39;m only 26).  Collecting is a sickness, and while many people are infected \nonly a limited number enjoy Japanese swords and fittings, etc.  Ebay is a \nworld wide community and there are people buying swords and tsuba everyday.  I&#39;m \nsure that 20% don&#39;t even know about this list (my guess comes from no data \nwhat so ever).  I think there is potential to recruit from the ranks of ebay.  My \n2 cents.\n\nLou\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
