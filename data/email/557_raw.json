The concensus to date is that this is earl=\r\ny Akasaka. While I am more than content with that attribution I was wonderi=\r\nng how common the thick round mimi was in Aakasaka work? Also there are a l=\r\not of bones in the mimi. I understand that early Akasaka work was influence=\r\nd by Owari tsuba, is this an example of this? or should I be looking in ano=\r\nther direction.\nAll comments greatly appreciated.\n\n\n\n----------------------=\r\n-----------\nWant to chat instantly with your online friends?=A0Get the FREE=\r\n Yahoo!Messenger\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
