Probably gourds at 3:00\nand 9:00.  The birds lack long necks, so they&#39;re probably not geese.  The\nthings at ~5:00 and 11:00 look like folding fans as David said.  Rather than\na koto bridge, I think that the curving elements are positive relief stems\nfor the negative relief gingko leaves formed next to the kiri/gourd.  It\nlooks like the middle of the stem is missing from the left side, but the end\nof the stem is there at the top.\n\nI don&#39;t know what the combined meaning is.  Both gourds and kiri were\nassociated with Hideyoshi.  Gingko is a samurai loyalty symbol and is\nassociated with shrines and temples.  They&#39;re also planted around the\nImperial palace grounds in Tokyo, although I don&#39;t know if they&#39;re old\nenough to have been there when it was Tokugawa property.  If the birds are\nswallows that would go with the moat.  I can&#39;t think of anything specific\nabout the fans.  Anyway, just thinking out loud, I don&#39;t know what it adds\nup to.  Maybe some particular shrine or scenic spot?  The gourds and fans\nfor an outdoor party held there?\n\nJim\n\n\n\nHi all, yes, I am as is Ron is on this, I see the geese and I also think\nKiri mon, though there appears to be Gourds or Eggplant at the ends of\nthese mon ?. Could that be a bridge, the shape with the supports ?.\n\nNice whatever it is, looks Bushï¿½ maybe.\n\ncheers\n\nRich Turner\n\n\n"
