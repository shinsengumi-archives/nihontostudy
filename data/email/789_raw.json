Died ca. 1800, which is actually a bit early for the group.  I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve seen any as early as the 1600&#39;s - Sasano dates them to the late Edo period.  They took many of their designs from the Akasaka and some from Higo groups (as the later Akasaka did themselves).  Some of them supposedly studied with later Akasaka makers.  Their work can be quite good.  Cary had a nice signed Tosa Myochin guard on his table in SF.  It looked so much like an Akasaka guard that one of our club members asked me which generation it was by.  \nJim\n\n  Hi all, I am wondering how long the tosa tsuba smiths worked as I have mention on them in my books but they all seem to around the early mid 1600&#39;s. I am curious as to a tsuba signed Toshu Ju Kuniyoshi Saku and am wondering if anyone knows of this smith ?? It looks very much like an Akasaka piece.\n\n  cheers all\n\n  Rich\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
