They give the impression of being made for imminent use rather than routine daily wear.  The Satsuma rebellion label seems plausible, but I don&#39;t know of any hard evidence supporting F&G&#39;s attribution.  For what it&#39;s worth, the book published last year on Satsuma koshirae does not include any illustrations of this type of mount.\n\nOn the subject of your photos, I&#39;ve seen a lot of references to George I. Quimby&#39;s 1985 paper &quot;Japanese Wrecks, Iron Tools, and Prehistoric Indians of the Northwest Coast&quot; published in Arctic Anthropology 22(2):7-15.  I haven&#39;t read it, but it might be of interest.\n\nHere is a link to an interesting on-line article from the Royal British Columbian Museum web site that disputes Quimby but does cite intentional and unintentional travel by pre-20th C Japanese to the western coast of the Americas:\n\nhttp://rbcm1.rbcm.gov.bc.ca/hhistory/japaneseshipwrecks/toc.html\n\nJim\n\n  Dear Friends,\n        Please let me ask a question about a style of koshirae, even if I\n  suspects that it  falls well below the standards of most those on this\n  list.\n        I am suddenly, and I hopefully briefly, interested in so-called\n  &quot;Satsuma rebellion&quot; fittings. I recall seeing these over the years, but\n  never had a term for them until Fuller and Gregory published a couple of\n  pages about them in their first volume on &quot;Imperial swords.&quot; In that book,\n  they say - without reference - that the samurai army raised  against the\n  newly formed Imperial Army  of the Meiji government  by Saigo Takamori was\n  equipped with swords that have a distinctive flat wrap and very ordinary\n  kodogu. Notably, they often have simple washer style menuki.\n        There is no question that these fittings are a &quot;type&quot; that does occur\n  in the real world. By that I mean that it is a fairly consistent style that\n  we do see it from time to time. It looks expedient and very\n  &quot;utility-grade.&quot; But is anyone really aware of evidence that they really\n  were associated with the Satsuma Rebellion? I&#39;m wondering if they might\n  simply be very low-end koshirae produced in terminal Edo/Meiji times for\n  any market there was for low-end swords. If any one has insights on this, I\n  would appreciate them. Thnak you\n        I might as well explain why I ask. I recently acquired some (about\n  140 in all ) 1910 vintage photos of North Pacific ethnographic objects that\n  were being sold by a dealer. A couple of these pictures show Japanese\n  swords and at least one of them certainly looks like a &quot;Rebellion sword.&quot; I\n  know the Rebellion failed, but I have a hard time believing that Saigo left\n  Kyushu for the Aleutians!\n  Peter\n\n\n\n  Peter Bleed\n  Associate Dean\n  College of Arts and Sciences\n  1223 Oldfather Hall\n  University of Nebraska\n  Lincoln, NE 68588-0312\n  (402) 472-2891\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
