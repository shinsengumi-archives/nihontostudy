Fred was leading and Jeff Miller was at \n  the end and I was in the middle.\n\n  First Fred picked up a sword looked at it and bought it.It was a great \n  koto 28+ inch sword with some rust problems.He felt that he would be \n  able to double his money, and did on Sunday.A little bit later, Jeff \n  Miller picked up a blade that I had just set down - He did ask if I was \n  done -looked at it, bought it and then walked across the room and sold \n  it for a large profit.By this time I was wondering what was going on so \n  I stepped around Fred and was leading the group.This time I was going to \n  find the treasure!!!You are right. Very shortly, on swords I had passed \n  by, both Fred and Jeff bought blades.After I whined a little bit, they \n  did help me find a blade to add to my collection.\n\n  At another show I remember Fred buying a sword. That evening he took the \n  blade to his room and by the next day had cleaned up the blade and \n  mountings so that he was able to sell at a profit.\n\n  One show we decided to make the drive together. Coming home was great.We \n  both had bought swords and when we were not driving, we were cleaning, \n  or working on researching the smiths, talking about what made up the \n  sword and why it was an example of that school.The trips will be much \n  longer now.\n\n  He will be missed.\n\n  Later\n\n  david\n\n  -- \n  -- \n  David McDonald Collector of Japanese Swords and Old Iron\n  PO Box 265 WEB page - http://www.montanairon.com\n  Sidney MT 59270 email - jswords@...\n  406-482-3243 evenings I do tsukamaki (wrapping of sword hilts)\n\n  Owner of White IH Cub& Super A Farmall, IH 100& 130, 140, AC G\n  McD type M, Monitor, Frost King and other stationary engines.\n\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n  \n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
