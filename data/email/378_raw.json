The school, as you note, is conservative, which is probably due to\ntheir Yamato origins, another very conservative place. I read the school\nname as Kongobyoe, which is the pronunciation typically heard in Japan,\nalthough there seems to be an alternative to just about every possible\nreading for a name. The blades are seen as &quot;waki-mono&quot; or outside the main\nschools. There has long been a tendency to look down on &quot;waki-mono&quot; with\nsome exceptions. Part of the problem is that with this school and others\nsuch as the Kanabo school, the Bungo Takada school, the Kai Mihara school,\nthey produced a lot of kazu-uchi, which were obviously popular because they\nhave been so well used -- or used up. There are many who think that this is\nall these schools produced, which like all generalizations, doesn&#39;t hold\ntrue for a small, but important body of very good work. Thus, you should\nlook at the individual blade for the quality it possesses and not the\n&quot;truths&quot; distributed by opinion makers. The nice thing about Kongobyoe and\nthe other schools I have mentioned, is that due to these kinds of\nprejudices, their prices remain affordable even in Japan. Hope this fogs the\nissue up sufficiently.\n\nGordon\n  -----Original Message-----\n  From: paul bowman [mailto:bowman1955@...]\n  Sent: Tuesday, June 17, 2003 7:35 PM\n  To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com\n  Subject: [nihontostudy] kongo-bei\n\n\n  Hi All,\n  this is a first message to the group so I am hoping I havent been beaten\nby technology.\n  having seen Carys beautifully mounted Kongo-bei katana I was wondering\nwhat the current view/ opinion of this school was. I understand that they\nwere not particularly highly thought of 20+ years ago as they were regarded\nas ultra conservative and not conforming directly with one of the 5\ntraditions. More recently 1 was listed in Comptons 100 masterpieces and I\nhave seen several others (well at least 1) with Juyo certification. I bought\na O-suriage katana with hozon papers a couple of years ago and have to say I\nreally like it, not least for the fact it is extremely healthy\n particularly for a blade that is between 5 and 700 years old) and a\npowerful blade. Originally it must have been 31+ inches long. Has the school\nbecome more widely appreciated in recent years or is it just us ultra\nconservative suguha fanatics that love them.\n  would value opinions\n  regards\n  paul\n\n\n\n  ---------------------------------\n  Want to chat instantly with your online friends?
