My sample of ONE\nwas a 2 inch kojiri on a katana I once had.  I saw similar work in one of Bob\nHaynes&#39; catalogues that he called Kaga Fushimi.  That&#39;s the beginning and end of\nmy knowledge on this, except that I do have a Heianjo/Yoshiro zogan tsuba the\nsame as the one in Gary D. Murtha&#39;s Vol 1 (? - maybe Vol 2).  Oh, in Kaga\nFushimi work the leaves were modelled in a copper-like alloy and the veins\nincised, so the resemblance in this case is only superficial.  I&#39;m not making an\nauthoritative statement here...\nBarry Thomas.\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: Ron Hartmann &lt;swords@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Sunday, April 24, 2005 6:15 AM\nSubject: Re: [nihontostudy] yoshiro school tsuba?\n\n\n\nHi Alan -\n\nSorry. When I said Kaga and the Yoshiro, I meant Kaga Yoshiro and the Yoshiro of\nKyoto area. (I think that&#39;s right, right?)\n\nWhen thinking Kaga Yoshiro, I&#39;ve had the impression that more often they would\nhave squarish-type hitsuana; these are conventional shape with the kogai histsu\nbeing very &quot;rounded/drilled-like&quot; as you see on many of the Kyo-sukashi tsuba.\nThat was my thinking here. Not sure why, but I also thought Kaga Yoshiro tsuba\nwere more of a thinner plate than the others, but I&#39;m not sure where that idea\ncame from.\n\nRon\nSTL\n\n  ----- Original Message -----\n  From: Alan Bale\n  To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com\n  Sent: Saturday, April 23, 2005 3:04 PM\n  Subject: Re: [nihontostudy] yoshiro school tsuba?\n\n  It looks like Kaga to me, don&#39;t forget that you also divide Yoshiro into\n  &#39;Kaga Yoshiro&#39; and &#39;Bizen Yoshiro&#39;.\n\n  Alan\n\n  ----- Original Message -----\n  From: &quot;dirk marshall&quot; &lt;dirkmarshall@...&gt;\n  To: &lt;nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n  Sent: Saturday, April 23, 2005 7:56 PM\n  Subject: [nihontostudy] yoshiro school tsuba?\n\n  &gt; I bought this with the other and got a good deal as they were rusty.
