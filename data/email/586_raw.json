One called the owl the &quot;messenger of the devil!&quot; Thinking about this, I wonder why the owl would had been used on kodogu, specifically menuki, unless of course it was to imply death from the sword, or something like that. (Seems the poor old owl is getting a bad rap! Neat bird!)  \n\n  Ron\n  STL\n    ----- Original Message ----- \n    From: David Zincavage \n    To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n    Sent: Saturday, July 19, 2003 12:03 PM\n    Subject: Re: [nihontostudy] What does owl symbolize?\n\n\n    I have found it necessary recently to lay in some references on the subject to satisfy my own curiosity:\n\n    Hibi Sadao and Niwa Motoji, &quot;Snow, Wave, Pine -- Traditional Patterns in Japanese Design,&quot; Kodansha, 2001.\n\n    Merrily Brand, &quot;Symbols of Japan -- Thematic Motifs in Art and Design,&quot; Rizzoli, 2001.\n\n    I have a third out-of-print title on order.\n\n    Hibi & Niwa do not discuss the owl.\n\n    Baird (113-114) writes:\n\n    &quot;OWL. The owl figured prominently in the artistic symbolism of the ancient Chinese, who seemed to have viewed the nocturnal bird as capable of making the realm of night and darkness safer.  With the passage of time, the owl&#39;s apparent role as mediator of the world of darkness waned, however, and it came to be viewed with dread.  Moreover, there arose the belief in China that owlets devoured their mothers, and the bird thereby became a symbol of filial betrayal.  It was these later, negative associations that crossed from China to Japan.  Because the owl (_fukuro_) is generally considered evil, and an omen of death, it only rarely appears on personal and household objects in Japan.     \n\n    David\n      ----- Original Message ----- \n      From: Ron Hartmann \n      To: nihontostudy \n      Sent: Friday, July 18, 2003 4:25 PM\n      Subject: [nihontostudy] What does owl symbolize?\n\n\n      Hi - \n\n      Looking at some menuki depicting (I think) a male and female owl sitting in a pine tree (branch). Realized I never really understood the meaning of the &quot;owl&quot; and thought somebody might jump in here and explain it for all to learn from.\n\n      Thanks!\n\n      Ron\n      STL\n\n\n      [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n            Yahoo!
