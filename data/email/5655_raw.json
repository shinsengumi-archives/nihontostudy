Please see my earlier posting for details and\nlimitations on consigned books.\n\nNo, I didn&#39;t win the lottery, no rich uncle died. It just seems that\ninterest has tapered off. I do want to thank all of you who have been\nsupportive (and got some great deals!)\n\nAs stated before, I have no other job than being a bookseller, and I will\ncontinue to do that, and offer specials on select books, and the occasional\nupdate when I list something that I think is worth noting for collectors, if\nonly for information purposes. I will describe my stock as accurately as\npossible, price fairly, and ship promptly packed for safe transit.\n\nMy last collection of tsuba is still for sale on Boris Markhasin&#39;s website,\n[url]www.yamabushiantiques.com[/url], on the consignment page. The prices\nshown were recently reduced from those that were listed in 2009.\n\nThanks,\n\nCraig\n\n-- \nCraig Harris\nBridge of Dreams, LLC\nBooks from and about Asia\nwww.bridgeofdreams.com\nMember, IOBA, Independent Online Booksellers Association\nMember, MWABA, Midwest Antiquarian Booksellers Association\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
