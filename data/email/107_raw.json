I have not seen one mounted with any sort of iron tsuba.  [Why were the leather-mounted swords perserved and the iron-mounted ones lost?]\n\nMost of the so-called &quot;tachi design orientation&quot; katchushi and tosho guards that I have seen have been speculative at best and incorrectly interpreted at worst.  I&#39;d like to discuss any specific examples anyone can cite.\n\nJim\n\n\n  Hi. \n  When one considers the design orientation of some of those tsuba it would\n  seems that must have been carried on tachi. On the issue of the lack of\n  confirmatory evidence, I used to point out to students, when the lecture\n  got to methodology, that the absence of evidence is not the same thing as\n  the evidence of absence. Further there are many katchushi and tosho that\n  would seem from the design orientation to be intended to be carried with\n  katana koshirae, and undoubtedly most were carried that way, however some\n  of them, perhaps the largest ones, were probably used on no-dachi for\n  which a katana orientation would probably make sense if they were used for\n  over the shoulder carry most of the time.\n\n\n\n\n\n  Arnold Frenzel\n  afrenzel@...\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
