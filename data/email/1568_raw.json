Given the uniqueness of the tsuka, I don&#39;t know how much more can be said, but it would certainly be interesting to find out.  \n\nHagihara-sensei has a Kofun jidai tsuba that was modified for wear on an Edo period wakizashi, so I would imagine that he&#39;d be enjoy seeing this piece.\n\nJim  \n\n  Gordon, Jim and all,\n        Let me follow up the shinsa&#39;ing tsuka thread. You may recall the\n  tsuka I discussed on this list last year that has Jomon age projectile\n  points set in as menuki. The kashira is clearly old and original but simply\n  plain iron. The fuchi matched - barely, and the wrap is nice and old.\n  Overall, I see little here that warrants &quot;papering&quot;, but I would like to\n  get a sense of the age and regional origin of the handle. Would the shinsa\n  team be able and willing to say anything in a case like this?\n        I realize that this sound for all the world like the problem I\n  presented to the last NTHK shinsa with the putative &quot;chokuto&quot;. Maybe my lot\n  in life is to be a thorn in the shins side!\n  Peter\n\n\n  Peter Bleed\n  Associate Dean\n  College of Arts and Sciences\n  1223 Oldfather Hall\n  University of Nebraska\n  Lincoln, NE 68588-0312\n  (402) 472-2891\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
