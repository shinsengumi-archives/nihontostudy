Usually kodogu is just displayed for study.=\r\n  We did tsuba \nkantei a couple of times in the NY club.  I made a small wo=\r\noden \nclamp that would cover up the seppa dai but still allow the tsuba to =\r\n\nbe picked up.  I haven&#39;t seen it done elsewhere.  Doing kantei kai \nof mum=\r\nei items is a little problematic since the &quot;right&quot; answer is \nstill an opin=\r\nion rather than a fact.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Doing it online has the handicap of not bei=\r\nng able to see \neverything about the piece, but of course that&#39;s true too o=\r\nf paper \nkantei contests for swords.  It could be done if someone has the \n=\r\ntime.  It&#39;d be easy enough to Photoshop out signatures.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Jim\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;   Greeting&#39;s all.

I am sure \nthere are\n&gt; &gt;   at group/club meeting=\r\ns and such but I was thinking more in \nline with the\n&gt; &gt;   Nihonto Kantei t=\r\nhe NTHK offer in their monthly or Kenji \nMishina offers\n&gt; &gt;   on-line.\n&gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;   The recent post&#39;s in regards to David and Curran&#39;s guards, \nwith the\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;   answers that ensued, got me thinking it would be great to see \nmaybe =\r\n1/2\n&gt; &gt;   a dozen tsuba offered up each month for kantei. I guess the \nusua=\r\nl\n&gt; &gt;   aspects of kantei would remain the same, i.e. style, type of \nwork,=\r\n size,\n&gt; &gt;   thickness, tekkotsu if there and either an image with the mei =\r\n\n( if\n&gt; &gt;   applicable ) hidden or some sort.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;   Just a thought, sou=\r\nnds like fun to me :-)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;   any thought&#39;s on this ?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;   Cheers\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;\n&gt; &gt;   Rich.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed=\r\n]\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
