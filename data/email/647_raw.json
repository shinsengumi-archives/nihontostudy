I am using a \n  Canoscan9900F, which is a very good scanner. I begin my scans through \n  Photoshop 7.0 into ScanGear CS. I have been using very high dpis of \n  1600 and 800 with the weak morei (spelling?) turned on and the sharp \n  turned off. I am still getting nasty looking morei in my scans of \n  oshigata for this summer&#39;s lecture. Any ideas on what I need to do to \n  improve my scans?\n\n  Gordon\n\n\n\n        Yahoo!
