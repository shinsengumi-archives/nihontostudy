The gold \nnunome\n&gt; decoration looks a bit weird but is probably original. Maybe it has \nworn off\n&gt; on most tsuba of this type we see.\n&gt; \n&gt; To me it looks like either Kyo Shoami or Kinai school work, going \non the\n&gt; treatment of the rim and the metal used + patina etc etc. Didn&#39;t \nthe first\n&gt; Kinai dude study in Kyoto in the Kyo Shoami style though??? Anyway \nI would\n&gt; date it to late in the edo period perhaps 1800 - 1850.\n&gt; \n&gt; So how was that then???\n&gt; \n&gt; Matt\n&gt; \n\n\nhahhahahahaaha, impressive mind, Gorby....... \nor did you klick on my feedback link ?\n\nhttp://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?\nViewItem&category=73466&item=3736240011\n\nanyway, without looking at the mei und assuming it&#39;s mumei, I would \nswear this is a typical Shoami work.\n\nmilt\n\n\n\n"
