The grain lines in the hada 2 photo \nactual=\r\nly shine brightly as opposed to what is seen in the picture.\nThere is a bit=\r\n of the hamon which can be seen in the upper section \nof the hamon 1 photo.=\r\n  The sword is in obvious need of polish.  It \nlaid on the battlefield at O=\r\nkinawa during WWll for several days \nbefore being discovered by a young Mar=\r\nine.  It was stored away with \nlittle or no attention since.  Oddly, the sw=\r\nord seemed to have found \nme as opposed to the other way around.\n\nI&#39;m tryin=\r\ng to research the sword and have a little knowledge from \nresearch I did on=\r\n swords my Father brought home from WWll as a 11th \nAirborne Paratrooper.  =\r\nI didn&#39;t realize what I was getting into!\n\nI&#39;ve had some much appreciated i=\r\nnput from Ron and Ricky.  I still \nthink judging from the Nakago condition =\r\nthe sword is most likely a \nBakumatsu era Ko-to copy.  If anyone should hap=\r\npen to have opinion \nas to time period or otherwise based on the photos it =\r\nwould be again \ngreatly appreciated!\n\nDave\n\n\n\n"
