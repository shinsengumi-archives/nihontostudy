There is a slight\nmisunderstanding as it is the museum&#39;s collection of\nkodogu that has recently been catalogued, not the\nswords, but I am pleased to tell you that a\npublication of about 150 pieces will be published next\nOctober.  At the same time we will have a display from\nthe catalogue as well as other pieces of Meiji\nmetalwork that relates to some of our later kodogu.  \n\nI hope you will be able to come to Boston to see the\nexhibition, it will be on view for about a year and\nthe catalogue will be sold in the museum shop, and I\nimagine on-line as well.  Also I&#39;m pleased to tell you\nthat at the time of publication of all the pieces from\nthe collection, which have been photographed for this\nproject,  will be available through the museum&#39;s\nwebsite.\n\n\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
