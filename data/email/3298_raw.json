Over lots and lots of time, the flannel thing\nworks... very slowly.\n\n_My main question_: what are the pros and cons of\nusing non-dyed (aka homespun) denim /instead of\nflannel/ to rub the faces of the tsuba?\n\n_Secondary question_: In jeans pocket, it seems the\nmimi takes on too much polish while the face gets only\nslightly polished. What are the opinions of aesthetic\nabout this? Should degree of Mimi polish and face\npolish be equal, or would Hagihara and other Japanese\nauthorities recommend more polish on the mimi and less\nwear on the face especially the seppa dai area, as\nwould happen to a mounted tsuba over time as it rubbed\nagainst the silk/cotton of its owner&#39;s kimono?\n\nCurran\n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?
