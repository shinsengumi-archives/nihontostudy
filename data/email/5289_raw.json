I do remember this now that you mentioned it. What started all this was my trying to &quot;date&quot; the gold dai-sho menuki I mentioned. When I see &quot;gold&quot; I tend to think &quot;late Edo&quot; but that&#39;s not always true. The set I bought from Fred, being a dai-sho and of gold still makes me think late Edo; if a single set (not made as a dai-sho) then I probably should be thinking &quot;maybe earlier.&quot; Oh such fun with these toys, eh? \n\nRon\n\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: ROBSON Gordon \n  To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Wednesday, February 27, 2008 3:23 PM\n  Subject: Re: [nihontostudy] Kyo-kinko\n\n\n  Hi Ron,\n\n  My understanding is that Kyo-Kinko is the new name for Waki-Goto. This would \n  make them a grab bag like Ko-Kinko or even Shoami. Their dates are post-Ko-\n  Kinko, so early Edo to Bakumatsu. There is a Kyo-Kinko book out there. I think the \n  title is Kyo-Kinko no Kenkyu (research into Kyo-Kinko) or something like that. Jim \n  is probably better up on this stuff then I am.\n\n  On on different note, good luck to Harry. Honto ni gambatte kudasai!!\n\n  Gordon\n\n\n   \n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
