Unless you can post photos of the tanto and its nakago, I for one would love to see some photos of it. One would think the commander would have owned a quality tanto, be it old or Showa era. Others may also ask to see these too, I&#39;d suspect. \n&gt;\n&gt;Thanks, Ron STL (Hartmann)\n&gt;swords@...\n&gt;\n&gt;  ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt;  From: Edward Young \n&gt;  To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n&gt;  Sent: Monday, January 07, 2013 6:08 PM\n&gt;  Subject: [nihontostudy] WWII vet bring back\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;    \n&gt;  I have recently acquired a WWII Trophy, a WWII Veteran bring back Tanto.\n&gt;\n&gt;  This Japanese Tanto may be of the Osoraku Zukuri blade form. It was found\n&gt;  on the body of Commander Goichi Oya (Commander of Japanese forces on Tinian\n&gt;  Island during WW II), who committed Seppuku in a cave on the Island during\n&gt;  the US invasion. The body and the Tanto were found by a US Marine named\n&gt;  Fred Osgood who was awarded the Bronze Star and a Purple Heart. He sent the\n&gt;  Tanto home in 1944 after the action on Tinian Island, and it was in his\n&gt;  possession since his return from the war until November of 2012 when it\n&gt;  came into my possession.\n&gt;\n&gt;  The Tanto is 13 1/16&quot; long with 3 3/8&quot; being the Nakago (As measured from\n&gt;  the Tsuba notch). It is 0.229&quot; thick just in front of the notch. The Nakago\n&gt;  tapers to 0.115 at it&#39;s end (See attached file image).\n&gt;\n&gt;  At this point I am wondering if any one has more information on this\n&gt;  particular, or type of, Tanto.\n&gt;\n&gt;  What I have found so far is that Commander Giochi Oya was A Commander in\n&gt;  the Imperial Japanese Navy, and Commander of the IJN 56th guard Unit, with\n&gt;  his head Quarters at Mt. Lasso, Tinian Island. He was responsible for the\n&gt;  defenses of the four air fields on Tinian Island. There on Tinian Island he\n&gt;  committed Seppuku August 2, 1944.\n&gt;\n&gt;  Thanks in advance for any information available,\n&gt;\n&gt;  Ed.\n&gt;\n&gt;  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n\n\n"
