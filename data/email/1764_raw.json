Lewis&quot; &lt;ashigaru1@y...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; --- In nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Jim Gilbert&quot; &lt;jggilbert@E...&gt; \n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; I asked a friend who has the Dragon tsuba.  he states that it is in \n&gt; the Higa [spelling] style, they are Water Dragons;  it was cast in \n&gt; soft metal.  yeah, mid - late shinshinto.  always mumei.  and more \n&gt; likely was made for a ko-wakizashi not a tanto.  too big for tanto.\n&gt; \n&gt; doug e.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Patrik,\n&gt; &gt; The undecorated mokko-shaped one is the older of the two.  Given \n&gt; the style of the plate and shape and the angle of the kozuka ana \n(the \n&gt; oval opening) it may be as old as the late Muromachi to Momoyama \n&gt; period (late 16th C).  Given the style of raised rim, it would \n&gt; probably be designated as a Katchushi (armor maker&#39;s) tsuba, \nalthough \n&gt; that is more a convenient term than a literal truth.  It&#39;s a nicely \n&gt; proportioned and apparently well made guard, although simple.  It \n&gt; looks like there is black lacquer on a lot of the surface.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The style of the dragon on the other tsuba is typical for Echizen \n&gt; Kinai work from the mid to late Edo period.  It&#39;s often seen in \n&gt; larger tsuba, but less common in tanto guards.  Given the soft \ndetail \n&gt; and the look of the seppa dai (the central flat oval) it might be \n&gt; cast.  I can&#39;t tell for sure from the photos.  \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; What does the rest of the mounting with the older guard look like?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Jim\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   Hi\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   i made a trade a did get two &quot;Tantos&quot;, can anyone tell me \n&gt; something \n&gt; &gt;   about the tsubas that were mounted on them, se pics under \nphotos \n&gt; &gt;   Tsubas2.jpg , would be nice to now age or something on them\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   Best Regards\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   Patrik\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
