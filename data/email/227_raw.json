However, I agree with the thinking that the bow was the primary\nweapon way back in the Kamakura period. How often did a Samurai on horseback\nactually use his sword?\n\nFor running down a fleeing opponent or getting close with another mounted\nwarrior, especially one still holding his bow, a light, long, and curved sword\nis very effective. If you are using a 3 foot long sword from horseback, its\nweight is a prime factor. With my left hand on the reins, I would want my sword\nto be light and easy to draw, hold, and use with my right arm and hand. Such a\nsword enables one to deliver many slashing blows without getting tired. A\nleather tsuba certainly didn&#39;t add extra weight, or affect the balance of the\nweapon to any great degree. I would never be aiming for my opponents tsuba or\nhis helmet bowl if fighting from horseback. I don&#39;t think I would get close to\nanybody until I used up all my arrows. Perhaps then I would draw my sword.\nThose fellows on the ground with the long nagamaki&#39;s scare me (and especially\nmy horse a lot), but if I can get swiftly past the blade, or they turn their\nbacks on me, watch out, they are most likely dead.\n\nAs Dennis Miller often says: &quot;....and I could be wrong about this.&quot;\n\nRichard\n\nnihontostudy@yahoogroups.com wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; nihontostudy-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; There are 2 messages in this issue.\n&gt;\n&gt; Topics in this digest:\n&gt;\n&gt;       1.

The early warrior chronicles would support\n&gt; this notion of one on one combat. The sohei (warrior monks) with their long\n&gt; naginata and nagamaki might have hit a tsuba, but as these warriors were\n&gt; essentially unmounted, I think they did not typically engage with mounted\n&gt; warriors. I know that a naginata is good for taking down a horse, but you\n&gt; have to stand out in the open with a guy who is also armed with a bow to do\n&gt; that, I would think.\n&gt; Joining Tom in thinking outloud.\n&gt;\n&gt; G\n&gt; ----------\n&gt; From: tom helm &lt;junkmail@...&gt;\n&gt; To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: Re: [nihontostudy] unscientific kawa tsuba experiment\n&gt; Date: Sat, 10 May 2003 17:34:59 -0700\n&gt;\n&gt; Jim et al-\n&gt;       If we accept what we are told about the warfare of the times,\n&gt; I believe a mounted warrior with a three foot tachi would be hard\n&gt; pressed to cut another mans tsuba who was also mounted.
