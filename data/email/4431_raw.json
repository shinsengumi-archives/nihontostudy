I collect old sterling and coin silver,\ngenerally pre-185=\r\n0, but am open to picking up a later piece now and\nthen if it has nice hand=\r\nwork (as opposed to the more typical punch\npress garp).  I just landed this=\r\n small (5 inch) Victorian sugar sifter\nladle by Walter and John Barnard of =\r\nLondon.  The pierced and hand\nengraved theme is ginko, I believe, very Japa=\r\nnese in flavor and not\ntypical of most occidental Art Nouveau (usually lean=\r\ned more toward\nacanthus).  While not up to Japanese standards, the work her=\r\ne isn&#39;t\nall that bad, and the piece was in my price range (cheep! cheep!\nch=\r\neep!).  Note that much of western-made Japanese-style Art Nouveau\nmetal wor=\r\nk, particularly mixed metal, generally costs much more than\nthe equivalent =\r\ntype (and much superior quality) authentic Japanese\nwork (well, IMO).  \n\nht=\r\ntp://img.photobucket.com/albums/v139/nihontochicken/Ladle7.jpg\n\nNC\n\n\n\n\n\n"
