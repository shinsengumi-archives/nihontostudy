I will\ncertainly have a number of pieces that have genuine uttori overlays with me.\nSo, we can continue the Tampa discussion in SF. I have expanded my Ko-Mino\ncollection, so there will be a chance to compare Ko-Mino, Ko-Kinko and\nKo-Goto pieces as well. \n\n \n\nGordon\n\n \n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Ron Hartmann [mailto:swords@...] \nSent: Tuesday, February 01, 2005 1:31 AM\nTo: TOKEN; nihontostudy; nihonto@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: [nihontostudy] identifying utori technique\n\n \n\nAnother topic which we discussed awhile ago was to understand and recognize\nthe use of gold utori overlay on fittings, what is true &quot;utori&quot; and what is\nnot. \n\nJim Gilbert mentioned recently that he plans to be at the Tampa show this\nyear if all goes well. I don&#39;t recall just who all became involved in our\non-line discussion of &quot;utori&quot; but I for one, plan on bringing along a few\nexamples of what &quot;I&quot; call utori and also a few examples of what I have my\ndoubts about being &quot;true&quot; utori technique. Keep this in mind and if we can\ngather a few of us together for a short while that weekend, maybe with Jim&#39;s\nleadership we could all learn something about &quot;utori&quot; work. I will have a\ntable to sit down at or if not there, certainly a quiet corner can be found\nsomewhere there. I for one look forward to some discussion on this topic!\n\nRon\nSTL\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n\n  _____  \n\nYahoo!
