What&#39;s troubling me is that Sasano-\nsensei seems to indicate in his Early Japanese Sword Guards \nthat not only the rim and plate of an iron tsuba may be cleaned of \ntheir red rust, but even the sukashi openings.  Of course, I have \nread what Jim Gilbert says on his Tsuba site regarding cleaning, \nand indeed Jinsoo Kim advises just the same: do NOT clean the \nsukashi openings of iron tsuba!  So I am confused.  To clean or \nnot to clean, that is the question!  Many thanks for your informed \nopinions... :o)\n\nSteve\n\n\n"
