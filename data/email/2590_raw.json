Clearly you have major issues with the courier you are using and the\npolice should be involved immediately upon any suspicious activity, but\nplease do not besmirch the efforts of the Japanese Canadian Cultural Centre\nas it attempts to educate people on the samurai sword. Senior members of the\nJSS/US are active participants in this group and I am sure they are not\ngoing to be a party to any activity that does not promote a complete respect\nfor the sword and its history. Sorry to vent, but this was not an\nappropriate conclusion on your part.\r\n____________________________________________\r\nDoug Blain, Manager, Information Technology Security\r\nComputing & Communications Services,\r\nUniversity of Guelph\r\nPhone: (519) 824-4120 ext. 56475\r\nFax: (519) 767-1620\r\n\r\n  ----- Original Message ----- \r\n  From: samurai@... \r\n  To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \r\n  Sent: Friday, January 21, 2005 11:12 AM\r\n  Subject: [nihontostudy] stolen sword alert\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  A Tokubetsu Juyo Yukimitsu was stolen in transit from me to Japan. \r\n\r\n  Last year a Juyo Token Niji Kunitoshi was taken in the same manner, it\r\n  was scanned by someone as being sent to Canada Customs, then it\r\n  vanished. There was a several week period in both cases of me having to\r\n  fight people who&#39;s computer screens told them something that wasn&#39;t\r\n  true, then finally they admitted the package vanished into thin air.\r\n\r\n  Last year they searched the warehouse several times without it turning\r\n  up, and when I said I was sending the police over, 15 minutes later the\r\n  sword appeared in some office where someone had &quot;mistakenly left it&quot;\r\n  after scanning that it was sent to customs.\r\n\r\n  My hope is that the same scam is being played again.\r\n\r\n  Obviously with the cost of a blade like this, it is not a trivial matter\r\n  and I feel kind of sick. Insurance says they will not cover it. \r\n\r\n  Pictures of the blade are on my site as I have the paperwork.\r\n\r\n  It has gone missing or been stolen in the Toronto area. Lately there\r\n  has been a new study group formed in Toronto with a lot of attendees. It\r\n  is possible with the new dissemination of information there that there\r\n  is more knowledge about the value of these swords and so we&#39;re going to\r\n  start seeing more thefts. \r\n\r\n  Here&#39;s the link to my site:\r\n\r\n  http://www.nihonto.ca/yukimitsu-2/\r\n\r\n  Please, everyone be on the lookout for someone who is asking questions\r\n  about an antique sword that they have found, and are trying to get the\r\n  value of that matches the pictures and description on my site. If\r\n  someone presents it to you in person, please take it and call the police\r\n  immediately.\r\n\r\n  - darcy\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\r\n  Yahoo!
