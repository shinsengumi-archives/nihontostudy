I hadn&#39;t realized the piece was so large.  It must b=\r\ne very heavy.  \nFascinating details regarding the hitsuana, as well.  I&#39;d l=\r\nike to ask if you could elaborate a \nbit on what is meant by &quot;Owari iron.&quot; =\r\n Exactly what gives it away when one identifies a \nparticular tsuba&#39;s iron =\r\nas &quot;clearly Owari&quot;...?  Thanks again, Jim, for another great Kantei.  \nAlre=\r\nady looking forward to another...\n\nSteven\n\n\n--- In nihontostudy@yahoogroups=\r\n.com, &quot;Jim Gilbert&quot; &lt;jggilbert@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I have added scans of the ot=\r\nher side of the tsuba to the folder below.  I forgot to \nmention the dimens=\r\nions again, so for the record they are 90.1 mm H x 84.1 mm W x 5.0 - \n5.5 m=\r\nm thick at the mimi.\n&gt; \n&gt; The maker is Nobuie and the signature is of the t=\r\nype now called futoji-mei =E5=A4=AA=E5=AD=97=E9=8A=98 \n(bold, thick).  With=\r\nin both the hanare and futoji-mei types there is considerable variation \nin=\r\n the detail of the signatures.  This example is not one of the more boldly =\r\nexecuted \nfutoji-mei.  As Pete crypictically indicated, an oshigata of this=\r\n guard is published in \nNakamura Kakudayu and Akiyama Kyusaku&#39;s 1926 Nobuie=\r\n Tsuba shu (#52).  There the \nsignature is described as sumari-mei =E8=A9=\r\n=B0=E3=82=8A=E9=8A=98 (&quot;close packed&quot;), which is one of the older \nterms no=\r\nw included within the futoji-mei type.  This guard is described as futoji-m=\r\nei in \nseveral later books and in the NBTHK&#39;s attribution.\n&gt; \n&gt; The hitsuan=\r\na had not yet been filled when the oshigata was made.  This guard was the \n=\r\nproperty of the Okubo daimyo family in Odawara until it was sold in 1931, s=\r\no the ana were \nlikely filled by the new owner.  It is unlikely that they a=\r\nre original to the plate given that \nthey are made such that the guard woul=\r\nd be mounted with the unsigned side as the front.  \nThe shapes of the hitsu=\r\nana are unusual.   It was clearly mounted with an o-kozuka, which \nare typi=\r\ncally 18-20 mm wide (vs. the standard size of 14-15 mm).  As Gordon mention=\r\ned, \nthe small size of the kogai-ana suggests it was mounted with one of th=\r\ne narrow style ko-\nMino kogai.  The opening is too small to accommodate a s=\r\ntandard 14-15 mm wide kogai.\n&gt; \n&gt; The early Edo period &quot;betsujin&quot; (differen=\r\nt person) Nobuie work will lack the quality in the \nmetal, tekkotsu, finish=\r\n and carving.  The plates are usually rather characterless and the \nworking=\r\n lacks subtlety.  The late Edo period revival pieces do indeed try to emula=\r\nte the \nfinish of the originals and as Alan mentioned some do a fairly good=\r\n job.  In general, the \nworking of the rim is a bit forced and overdone in =\r\nthese examples compared to the \noriginals.  They obviously will look young,=\r\n but there is also a somewhat artificial quality to \nthem.  The same feelin=\r\ng comes from later copies of early Shino and Oribe ceramics.\n&gt; \n&gt; The metal=\r\n, tekkotsu and yakite finish should lead to an Owari origin.  Remember that=\r\n \nKaneie worked in Kyoto, and everything about his guards is in line with K=\r\nyoto methods \nand aesthetics.\n&gt; \n&gt; That&#39;s all I can think of at the moment.=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Jim  \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   The photos for kantei problem number three can be =\r\nviewed here:\n&gt; \n&gt;   http://ph.groups.yahoo.com/group/nihontostudy/photos/br=\r\nowse/3108\n&gt; \n&gt;   Jim\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been r=\r\nemoved]\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n"
