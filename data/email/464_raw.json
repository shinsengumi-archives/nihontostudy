I think that these are\nhybred\n    oshigata as only width and curvature is given, but not a specific length\nfor\n    the blade. Also note in regard to the Kanabo information, no Yamato-den\n    style workmanship has been seen is false. I have a ko-wakizashi signed\nNanto\n    ju Kanabo Hayatonosho Masazane on the omote and kore wo Hosho utsusu\n(this\n    is a Hosho copy) on the ura. The nakago has a ichimon style nakagojiri\nwith\n    higaki yasuri like Hosho works and the jigane is masame with a narrow\nsuguha\n    temper and nijuba, all typical of the Hosho school of the Yamato-den.\n    Remember, never say never.\n\n    Gordon\n\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n        Yahoo!
