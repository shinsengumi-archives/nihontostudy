I have seen many swords with Mur=\r\nomachi/Momoyama style\n&gt; koshirae over the years, but 99.9% have been 19th c=\r\n. swords in retro \n&gt; style.\n&gt; Two exceptions come to mind: Victor Harris an=\r\nd I catalogued the blades in\n&gt; the Museum of Japanese Sword Fittings in Tok=\r\nyo for Christie&#39;s in &#39;05. In\n&gt; that collection was a Momoyama tachi koshira=\r\ne that was later sold in \n&gt; NY, the\n&gt; other was an itomaki tachi made for a=\r\nn Ikeda Daimyo in Christie&#39;s London.\n&gt; Victor has seen this nagamaki and ag=\r\nrees that it is 16th c.\n&gt;\n&gt; I think this weapon is the first of a number of=\r\n identical contract pieces\n&gt; for an armoury, as it is numbered &#39;1&#39; as are o=\r\nne seppa, the fuchi and the\n&gt; tsuka in ink under the fuchi, it is utilitari=\r\nan, with thin yamagane \n&gt; mounts\n&gt; and low quality lacquer, the nakago-ana =\r\nare not well made. The long ububa\n&gt; can be accounted for by its lack of use=\r\n, it may have been polished \n&gt; only once\n&gt; or twice then stored for a very =\r\nlong time, this would account for its \n&gt; fairly\n&gt; good condition apart from=\r\n the leather tsuka binding shrinking and being\n&gt; attacked by insects.\n&gt;\n&gt; I=\r\nt may look like a sword but it has the thick saya of a polearm, no \n&gt; kurik=\r\nata\n&gt; and the tsuka is 21.5&quot; long.\n&gt;\n&gt; As I stated in my earlier post it we=\r\nighs around 6lbs, this is not \n&gt; something\n&gt; one would want as a personal w=\r\neapon, it is too heavy and awkward to carry\n&gt; and I think would only be use=\r\nful in battle.\n&gt;\n&gt; --\n&gt; I am using the free version of SPAMfighter.\n&gt; We ar=\r\ne a community of 7 million users fighting spam.\n&gt; SPAMfighter has removed 9=\r\n of my spam emails to date.\n&gt; Get the free SPAMfighter here: http://www.spa=\r\nmfighter.com/len\n&gt;\n&gt; The Professional version does not have this message\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n&gt; \n\n\n[Non-text po=\r\nrtions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
