If this opinion is correct (Jingo), having the fittings &quot;in hand&quot; would show them to be mumei anyway. Do you think a shinsa team would make the call to Jingo in a case like this? I&#39;ve often wondered about submitting this tsuka but that&#39;s yet to be done. (Perhaps you saw this tsuba somewhere over the years.)\n\nRon\nSTL\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: Jim Gilbert \n  To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Monday, January 19, 2004 3:35 PM\n  Subject: Re: [nihontostudy] shinsa question\n\n\n  Cary,\n  Good to hear your voice on the list again.\n\n  Based on my limited experience with overseas NTHK shinsa, the criteria are similar.  One difference is that submissions for koshirae shinsa, including tsuka-only submissions, will have the signatures of the kodogu elements noted where visible, but will not get attributions of maker or time period for any unsigned kodogu elements.  \n\n  So, Milt&#39;s tsuka, if genuine, would be described in detail as to materials, carving and inlay techniques, decorative motifs, and be measured and photographed, but would not receive maker attributions for the menuki or fuchigashira.  A date and point value for the koshirae as a unit will be provided, but not for the individual kodogu elements.  \n\n  Agreed that a tsuba and tsuka without a saya is not an appropriate submission for koshirae shinsa.\n\n  A customer can submit a complete koshirae for shinsa and then, for example, submit the mumei tsuba separately as kodogu if an attribution of maker, time period and point value is desired.  This requires two submissions, though.\n\n  An advantage of overseas shinsa is that we can immediately contact the owner of the item if there is a problem with the submission.  For example, if a tsuka is submitted for koshirae shinsa and the fuchigashira are genuine but the menuki are reproductions, we will track down the owner and advise him that the item will fail as koshirae due to the menuki, but that if he would like to change the submission (no additional charge) to kodogu shinsa of the fuchigashira, it can be certified.  We &quot;saved&quot; a nice Omori Teruhide F/K this way.\n\n  Jim  \n\n\n\n\n\n    Milt,\n    I cannot speak for the NTHK.\n    Jim will be able to answer the shinsa criteria for fittings.\n\n    My experience with the NBTHK is:\n    You can submit the entire tsuka.\n    If any element is false (gimei FK, cast menuki)it will not pass.\n    If all is proper it will paper as &quot;Tsuka mae&quot;.\n    The mei of the FK will be noted.\n    If there is no mei it will likely be attributed.\n\n    The tsuba will require a separate submission.\n\n    Twofer&#39;s include Daisho Tsuba, Daisho FKs, or Menuki,\n    Futokoro or Mitokoromono, and of course Daisho koshirae.\n\n    Cary Condell\n\n    Condell & Co., Ltd.\n    P.O.
