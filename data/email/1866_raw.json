I don&#39;t have it hand as yet, when I do \nI&#39;ll scan it and measure it properly and post the pics though the \nmeasurements I do have are 76 x 76 x 5 mm.\n\nRich\n\n\n\nCurran Campbell wrote:\n\n&gt; Rich,\n&gt;\n&gt; I would agree with you pretty much on every point.\n&gt; Has that Higo / Akasaka feel to it and iron looks\n&gt; cleaner, such that I would say mid to later Akasaka.\n&gt;\n&gt; The central design is very similar to one of the 2\n&gt; Akasaka tsuba I own (though shape and iron quality are\n&gt; different). Basically a sense of &#39;swirling motion&#39;\n&gt; with paulownia flowers. It is one of my better tsubas\n&gt; and I believe it to be probably 3rd generation or\n&gt; around that time, though Jim G. has seen it and can\n&gt; correct me.\n&gt;    Since the central design element is so close, I&#39;ll\n&gt; try and photograph & post it for\n&gt; comparison/discussion.\n&gt;\n&gt; How thick is it at center? Does it thin out a mm or\n&gt; 2mm by the mimi?\n&gt;\n&gt; Curran\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
