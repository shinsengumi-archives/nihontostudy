You can tell that there&#39;s some relief from the straight-on view, but not how high it really is until you get a view from the side. \n\nAlso it&#39;s not just high relief, but very straight walled.  Goto Joshin also did pieces with high relief, but his carving style used that height for three dimensional modeling.  His volumes are large overall.  \n\nKo-Mino has a unique look.\n\nJim \n\n\n\n  Jim - \n\n  Here are a couple (not so good) pictures of a kozuka that I&#39;ve had for years that I&#39;ve always considered ko-Mino because of the high raised and cut design. One photo shows the face of the kozuka, the other its profile showing the greatly raised design. Maybe this will explain what you&#39;ve been saying, maybe not. Please, comments welcomed! \n\n    http://tinyurl.com/27m5c\n\n    Ron\n    STL\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
