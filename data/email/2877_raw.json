I can envision perhaps a dozen examples of zogan tsuba, representative of where it began to be used through to the more common Kyo-zogan work of mid-Edo. It seems Jim, Alan Harvie and Bob Haynes did this at one of the SF shows two or three years ago. Perhaps such a &quot;comparison&quot; or &quot;evolution of the technique&quot; has already been put together? If so, it would be a wonderful article to see in print for sharing.

When I said Kaga and the Yoshiro, I meant Kaga Yoshiro and the\n  Yoshiro of Kyoto area. (I think that&#39;s right, right?)\n  &gt;\n  &gt; When thinking Kaga Yoshiro, I&#39;ve had the impression that more often they\n  would have squarish-type hitsuana; these are conventional shape with the\n  kogai histsu being very &quot;rounded/drilled-like&quot; as you see on many of the\n  Kyo-sukashi tsuba. That was my thinking here. Not sure why, but I also\n  thought Kaga Yoshiro tsuba were more of a thinner plate than the others, but\n  I&#39;m not sure where that idea came from.\n  &gt;\n  &gt; Ron\n  &gt; STL\n  &gt;\n  &gt;   ----- Original Message ----- \n  &gt;   From: Alan Bale\n  &gt;   To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com\n  &gt;   Sent: Saturday, April 23, 2005 3:04 PM\n  &gt;   Subject: Re: [nihontostudy] yoshiro school tsuba?\n  &gt;\n  &gt;\n  &gt;   It looks like Kaga to me, don&#39;t forget that you also divide Yoshiro into\n  &gt;   &#39;Kaga Yoshiro&#39; and &#39;Bizen Yoshiro&#39;.\n  &gt;\n  &gt;   Alan\n  &gt;\n  &gt;   ----- Original Message ----- \n  &gt;   From: &quot;dirk marshall&quot; &lt;dirkmarshall@...&gt;\n  &gt;   To: &lt;nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n  &gt;   Sent: Saturday, April 23, 2005 7:56 PM\n  &gt;   Subject: [nihontostudy] yoshiro school tsuba?\n  &gt;\n  &gt;\n  &gt;   &gt;\n  &gt;   &gt; I bought this with the other and got a good deal as they were rusty.\n  I\n  &gt;   was wondering if this could be a yoshino or kaga tsuba.
