I had a good idea it wasn&#39;t an  \noriginal..I basically took it cause it does have a nice Hamon.\n \nNow the ones that I am finishing up making for book IV will in no way ever  \nbe confused with ANYTHING original simply by the way I am signing them and \nthe  method of polish...You can get a really NICE polish (&quot;working&quot; type) \njust by  using wet/dry paper up to 2500 grit wet and then hit it with 5000 \npumice in an  oil suspension. NOT for real swords but for &quot;modern Japan-ish&quot; \nstuff that I am  making for cutting up mats and the like...shows nice \nstructures within the blade  as well as the Hada on the laminated ones..\n \nI will just stash this one away for the above purposes....\n \nThanks all\n \nJPH\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
