It came out of Japan with the opinion that it was S�ten \nTadashige but I have not been able to get myself into that frame of mind \nfrom the day I received it.\n\nI have finally got some better images of the partial mei that exists and \nI think now it is Umetada Shigemasa. And I think the mei partialy reads \nNishijin ? ( Ju )  Umeteda Shigemasa.  also thought Shigeyoshi could \nhave been an outside chance but there is a tsuba in T�s� Kod�gu Meiji \nTaikai that whilst has the Yamashiro no Kuni version of the Shigemasa \nmei, has work ( waves and the like) that looks surprisingly close to my \nguard.\n\nHere are some images of the tsuba, and some spec&#39;s. It is Wakizashi \nsized, of average thickness and quite heavy, and appears to be very \ndense iron.\n\nSize 73mm x 69mm x 4mm\nWeight 140 gms ( 4.2 oz )\n\nThe images are labelled as S�ten as when purchased, that&#39;s what I was \nled to believe it was, and I never changed that.\n\nhttp://www.nihontomessageboard.com/tsuba_collection/soten_tadashige.jpg\n\nhttp://www.nihontomessageboard.com/tsuba_collection/soten_tadashige_mei.jpg\n\nhttp://www.nihontomessageboard.com/tsuba_collection/umetada_shigemasa.jpg\n\ncheers all\n\nRich\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
