I&#39;ve come to admire &quot;his&quot; p=\r\nersistence, although he&#39;s probably a\n&gt; boiler room somewhere rather than an=\r\n individual.\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m afraid that Gordon may be waving his cane and yelling =\r\nat the kids to\n&gt; stay off his lawn before long...\n&gt;\n&gt; I had a chance to loo=\r\nk at a very interesting tsuba recently. It&#39;s a typical\n&gt; bird in the plum t=\r\nree Higo guard, but what&#39;s interesting is that it wasn&#39;t\n&gt; completed. The d=\r\nesign is scribed into the plate and all of the roughing out\n&gt; was done with=\r\n a chisel. Even the outline of the rim is chiseled in with\n&gt; multiple cuts =\r\nfrom both sides. It looks like a slight gouge was used while\n&gt; cutting the =\r\nrim and most of the sukashi was cut with a straight chisel.\n&gt;\n&gt; A couple of=\r\n sections of sukashi have some file work done, but the rest is\n&gt; still roug=\r\nh. It looks like one of the thin branches was chiseled down too\n&gt; thin to b=\r\ne finished properly and the piece was abandoned. The color of the\n&gt; guard i=\r\nsn&#39;t bad (even though I doubt any patina was applied) and the build\n&gt; up on=\r\n the interior sukashi walls looks about like you&#39;d expect for an Edo\n&gt; piec=\r\ne.\n&gt;\n&gt; I recently spent two weeks shooting in Baja Sur, Mexico.
