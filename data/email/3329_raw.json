There were lots of\nissues but none of them due to dishonesty on his part.  I had numerous very\ncordial email exchanges with Don and he went to no end of trouble to ensure I\ngot my tapes.  They turned up in the end after a slow surface mail journey (my\nrequest).  It&#39;s a long story but in short I would give Don the benefit of the\ndoubt and give him every chance to remedy whatever situation has occurred\noutside his control.\n\nBest regards,\n\nBarry Thomas\n(Melbourne, Australia)\n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;sigp210&quot; &lt;sigp210@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Wednesday, September 14, 2005 4:28 AM\nSubject: [nihontostudy] Don Myrna of Gaijin&#39;s Guide Videos\n\n\nApologies for bringing this here, but I was wondering if anyone has\nany contact details besides the website email for Don Myrna of the\nGaijin&#39;s Guide series of videos?\nA friend ordered the videos from him way back in February, and they\nnever arrived. Numerous false promises of replacements and various\nexcuses and invalid tracking numbers have left me thinking he is a\nfraud or a conman that sometimes sends them, and sometimes doesn&#39;t.\nEmail comms have stopped, and he is avoiding all attempts to sort this\nout. Some people have reported that they received theirs, but I have\nfound 3 other people that have never received their videos, and have\nhad similar excuses about the postal services etc.\nI have exhausted all other options, and am fairly confident in my\ntheory, not just making blind accusations. Does anyone else have\nsimilar experiences?\nI would caution anyone else against dealing with him unless you are\ncertain you will receive your videos. He seems to con mainly\ninternational buyers. Seems well known, (and even respected by some)\nso not sure why the difficulties. \nDoes anyone have a reliable alternate source for the videos?\nGoing to do what I have to, to get my friend sorted out. I pointed\nthem out to him, and helped with Paypal payment, so feel obligated to\nassist.\n\nMany thanks,\nBrian\n\n"
