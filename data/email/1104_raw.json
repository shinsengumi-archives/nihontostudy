Some \nswords were affected, but only a mediocre shinto blade rusted.  The \nkoto under the same conditions were not damaged at all, although the \nshirasaya were stained and had to be reglued.  Just a koto/shinto \nanecdote.\n&gt; \n\nI&#39;ve heard of this sort of thing before. Seems that old (really old)\nsteel seems to develop a sort of surface stabilization (no technical\ndetails) that makes it less prone to rust. I&#39;ve a couple Koto\nblades that I haven&#39;t had to even oil while later period blades\nrequire almost constant attention. I don&#39;t know if there is a\n&quot;scientific&quot; explanation for this phenomenon (if it really \nexists) or not.\n\nRich S\n\n\n\n"
