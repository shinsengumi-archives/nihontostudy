Many thanks, Jim, for your very clear explanation.  \n\nSteven\n\n\n--- =\r\nIn nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Jim Gilbert&quot; &lt;jggilbert@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; S=\r\nteven,\n&gt; Color is probably the most difficult kantei datum.  The color of i=\r\nron tsuba has often \nbeen changed (passively or actively), it depends on th=\r\ne light used to view or photograph \nand depends very much on the perception=\r\n of the observer.  I would suggest concentrating \non everything else in dat=\r\ning Kanayama tsuba before considering color.\n&gt; \n&gt; With that caution, I thin=\r\nk that early Kanayama do not tend to show a reddish tone.  Not \nall Momoyam=\r\na ones are reddish in my experience, but some are.  So, the observation is =\r\n\nvalid, but it is not definitive in my opinion.\n&gt; \n&gt; If you do try to evalu=\r\nate iron color use direct but not dazzling sunlight.\n&gt; \n&gt; Jim\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n   In reading Sasano, I see that he frequently speaks of the color of a \n&gt; =\r\n  given tsuba as being indicative of its age/period, as well as of the \n&gt;  =\r\n qualitative aspects of its iron.  However, he tends not to elaborate \n&gt;   =\r\non this, and since the images are virtually entirely in black and \n&gt;   whit=\r\ne in the two well-known English language texts on sukashi tsuba, \n&gt;   it is=\r\n difficult to actually see what he means when he makes such \n&gt;   comments. =\r\n A few times he does note that Momoyama Kanayama tsuba tend \n&gt;   to have a =\r\nreddish cast to them (as well as being smaller) when \n&gt;   compared to Kanay=\r\nama guards of earlier times.  I was just wondering if \n&gt;   this is the cons=\r\nensus among those of you who have much experience with \n&gt;   Kanayama tsuba.=\r\n  If so, is it enough to conclude that such \n&gt;   characteristics are so con=\r\nsistent as to be understood as definitive of \n&gt;   the period?\n&gt; \n&gt;   Steven=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n"
