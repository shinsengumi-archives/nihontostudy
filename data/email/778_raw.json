It looks a bit better than the so-called &quot;Mito-Shoami&quot; shiiremono, but is probably in that bag.  I have followed up on that and I agree with Cary that there is no proof of the existence of a Mito Shoami group.  It was a handy label for the auction business, but I think we should avoid it going forward.  I still think that those guards probably do have an association with the Shoami because of the similarity of some of them to signed pieces like this one:\n\nhttp://tinyurl.com/ng6e\nhttp://tinyurl.com/ng6h\n\nJim\n  -\n\n\n  Gang,\n  talking about water buffalo..............here&#39;s a tsuba with water \n  buffalo \n  klick..........http://tinyurl.com/ncvk\n\n\n  question...... what schoo ?\n  1.
