His wife,\nBill MIller, Paul Davidson, Mel Oka, Ray Deadman, Bob\nLewertt,   Keith Hostler and myself went. Seems like\nsomeone else but oh that memory button......Anyway too\nmuch happened to repot it all but we did visit ( and\nalso dine with) Michihiro Tanabe. He laid out maybe 50\nswords for us and we kanteied some. Kotetsu&#39;s , Kiya\nMaro , freaking all the heavy hitters. The deadest\nfeeling block of metal was the Kiyo maru. Nothing to\nit. We aslo went out for a really cool dinner served\nby Geisha style chicks. Mr. Sugiyama (who was a\npolishing agent for Tanabe) attended as well as Gordon\nRobson. I have a back piece of a Samurai with a\nnaginata and made a fool of myself running around\nwothout a shirt on. Jeez, no class. Years later when I\nmet with Tanabe at the NBTHK convention in Osaka (Paul\nDavidson and I) Tanabe says &quot;Oh you&#39;re the tattoo\nguy!&quot; Well I guess it&#39;s beter t be\nremembered.....than........Bob Elder\n\nIf ignorance is bliss, how come I&#39;m not ecstatic!?\n\n"
