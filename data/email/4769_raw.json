The only feature tha=\r\nt may be\n&gt; &gt; considered common to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; them both is some evidence of a Ch=\r\ninese influence.\n&gt; &gt;  However, while \n&gt; &gt; &gt; with Namban tsuba this resulted=\r\n in a completely\n&gt; &gt; novel metalworking \n&gt; &gt; &gt; technique, Soten tsuba use c=\r\nonventional, Japanese\n&gt; &gt; techniques to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; illustrate historical suject=\r\ns which may be of\n&gt; &gt; Chinese derivation.  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; But there a lots of diffe=\r\nrences:-\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Soten tsuba came initially from a recognised\n&gt; &gt; &#39;sch=\r\nool&#39; of makers, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; although they were later mass produced outside\n&gt; &gt; t=\r\nhis.  There was \n&gt; &gt; never \n&gt; &gt; &gt; a recognised Namban &#39;school&#39;, the namban =\r\ninfluence\n&gt; &gt; being ubiquitous.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Namban tsuba had their origin =\r\nin China, were\n&gt; &gt; imported into Japan at \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the end of the C16, and re=\r\nached the peak of their\n&gt; &gt; popularity in the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; late C18.  Soten tsuba=\r\n date from the early C18 and\n&gt; &gt; continued to be \n&gt; &gt; &gt; made, as poor quali=\r\nty shiiremono, into the late\n&gt; &gt; Edo period.  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; (Although I have no ev=\r\nidence for this, I suspect\n&gt; &gt; that many of the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; latter may also have=\r\n been produced using the &#39;lost\n&gt; &gt; wax&#39; method of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; casting.)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; True examples of the Namban group are\n&gt; &gt; characterised by extensive \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; openwork and undercutting, whereas with Soten\n&gt; &gt; tsuba, while they m=\r\nay \n&gt; &gt; &gt; demonstrate some degree of openwork, this is not a\n&gt; &gt; constant f=\r\neature \n&gt; &gt; &gt; and never includes undercutting.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Namban tsuba co=\r\nmmonly have profuse gold\n&gt; &gt; decoration, either as \n&gt; &gt; nunome-\n&gt; &gt; &gt; zogan=\r\n or fire gilding.  Soten tsuba are\n&gt; &gt; characterised by selective \n&gt; &gt; &gt; an=\r\nd delicate inlays of gold, silver, copper and\n&gt; &gt; shakudo.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sot=\r\nen tsuba do not demonstrate the decorartive\n&gt; &gt; mimi, seppa-dai and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nryo-hitsu which characterise Namban tsuba. \n&gt; &gt; Signatures, although \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n admittedly usually gimei, feature frequently on\n&gt; &gt; Soten tsuba and \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n almost never in the Namban group.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; The design on Soten tsuba i=\r\ns themed, being is\n&gt; &gt; representative of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; specific characters or inci=\r\ndents, while that on\n&gt; &gt; Namban tsuba is \n&gt; &gt; &gt; purely decorative. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; No, I personally know of no relationship between\n&gt; &gt; the two groups.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Regards, John L.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In nihontostudy@yahoo=\r\ngroups.com, &quot;Elliott&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;elliott@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; First, I apprec=\r\niate all the comments that were\n&gt; &gt; made in reference \n&gt; &gt; to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; my \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; question about &#39;cast&#39; tsuba.
