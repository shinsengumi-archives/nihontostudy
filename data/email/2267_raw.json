Impermanence of course has Buddhist resonance as well.  Fitting out an entire koshirae in that motif is a bit over the top.  I suppose that there is a chance that it was put together for an early Western buyer, but that example didn&#39;t strike me as a typical export item.  \n\nI&#39;m speculating, but that koshirae doesn&#39;t seem like mainstream merchant or bushi wear.  It may be more of a gangster or gambler item, or something that someone from another class would wear to pretend while out on the town.  Maybe an equivalent of the mid-late 20th C American biker aesthetic as co-opted by upper-middle-class-baby-boomer Harley owners.    \n\nThere are people on this list who have spent a lot more time on late Edo period social history that I have -- any other ideas???\n\nJim\n\n\n\n  Thanks Jim, I&#39;ll make note of this info and also pass it on to my friend who owns that &quot;skull&quot; sword. Have you ever heard of &quot;why&quot; this motif was used (other than sybolizing the fields of Musashi)? Would this type of motif be associated with a person of any particular class or status? (This kowakizashi came from a German collection that was gathered in South Africa. The fellow died and his son moved to Missouri for awhile. Interesting origin!)\n\n  Ron\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
