(Reference\n&gt; -----in Chinese:\n&gt; http://www.chinadaojian.com.cn/ctdj/chinadj/200510/140.html\n&gt; Historic Record on Marshal Art --Swords and Knife-- Exchange\n&gt; Between China and Japan. -----written in Chinese citing among\n&gt; others Japanese record)\n\nYes, of course Mr Chen Ying-chaw, you are right.  I believe this is known as the\nKango Trade in the Kamakura period and later.  This was published in English\nabout 25 or so years ago in the USA - one of the Tai Kai publications. I had not\nread of the Trade in the early Shinto period/late Ming, but of course this is\nnot a well-researched area in the West, nor, I guess, in China either given the\nvicissitudes of the past 110 years.  With this lack of knowledge it isn&#39;t\nsurprising that no one (?) on this list knows anything about such a tsuba as Mr\nChen Ying-chaw has drawn our attention to.  So, given this lack of specific\nknowledge about the Japan-China trade in Nihonto I can only go by the tsuba AS A\nTSUBA in the context of my Japanese-centred knowledge.  More and better quality\nimages of this very interesting tsuba are warranted given the queries and issues\nraised.\n\nI&#39;ve looked long and hard at the very interesting image Mr Chen Ying-chaw has\ndrawn our attention to, and I note the following:\n\n- the quality of the work is poor.\n- note particularly the asymmetric shape of the nakago ana, as I have mentioned\n- note also the clumsy, unrefined shape of the seppa dai outline\n- note also the nakago ana placement in the seppa dai lacks symmetry.\n- finally, the mimi (rim) varies in width in a manner most uncharacteristic of\n  Japanese tsubako.\n\nBeing familiar with the exquisite excellence of Japanese metal work in tsuba and\nfuchigashira, I cannot accept that this tsuba was made under the auspices of the\nJapanese Emperor for the Chinese Emperor.  Let me propose another theory.\n\nMr Chen Ying-chaw notes:\n\n&gt; 1. Chinese emperor was the only one who is entitled\n&gt; to put dragon decors on everything he owned.\n&gt; 2. However dragons could also put to use as icons by\n&gt; other persons or entities only if the number of dragon&#39;s\n&gt; fingers reduced to either 4 or 3. Five fingers claws must\n&gt; not be used in any dragon unless the owner of that\n&gt; dragon design is Chinese emperor himself. Violation of\n&gt; such rule was subject to capital punishment.\n\nHowever, in Japan the dragon is a very common theme on all manner of things.\nGranted I have only seen 3 fingered dragons in Japanese art, but the so-called\nCanton tsuba were imported into Japan and I suggest that this tsuba could be of\nChinese origin intended to be exported to Japan at one time.  Supporting this\ntheory is the observation that this tsuba appears to have never been fitted to a\nsword, as indeed a great number of Japanese tsuba were never fitted to swords.\nI cannot recall seeing hitsuana of the specific type shown in the image.\n\nFinally, Mr Chen Ying-chaw wrote:\n\n&gt; Time and again in China, very fine quality old Japanese\n&gt; swords (for royal use?) can still be found. Some with\n&gt; tsuba missing\n\nSome years ago there was a very comprehensive (but not particularly\ninformative!) exchange of views on Nihonto in China on these sword lists - I\nstill have the correspondence in my archive.  There was no conclusive\ninformation of &quot;very fine quality old Japanese swords&quot; being found in China.\nI&#39;m sure we would all like to hear more about such finds with pictures and\nscholarly information if they exist.  Indeed, the article on the Kango Trade\nspeculated that many of the very best quality Koto were exported to China and\nhoped that some could still be found and restored to the world.\n\nThis exhausts my poor and inadequate opinion, so now I will retire from the\nlists and hope someone can offer a more definitive opinion.  I stand by my\nopinion that this is NOT a Japanese-made item.\n\nBest regards,\n\nBarry Thomas\n(Melbourne, Australia)\n\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &quot;sosidore&quot; &lt;sosidore@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Thursday, November 17, 2005 2:29 PM\nSubject: [nihontostudy] Re: A good story about one tsuba with some interesting\ndetails missing\n\n\nIt was Japan who kept the record in detail about presenting swords to\nChinese emperors during 15th century.

One sword to Chinese emperor (Ming dynasty) in 1401.\n2. Again, 100 swords among 202 pieces of varieties of swords\nin 1403 had been presented to Chinese emperor\n3. A total of 1200 swords had been presented to Chinese\nemperor before Ming dynasty ended in 1644.\nI think there is a strong likelihood that Japanese swords remained an\nimportant item among list of gifts presented to Chinese emperor until\nmid 19th century.\nTime and again in China, very fine quality old Japanese swords (for\nroyal use?) can still be found. Some with tsuba missing\nHow about royal tsuba?\nSo far this dragon design tsuba seems to be the first one that\nappears to fit an emperor��s sword pretty well.\n\np.s. This tsuba was not cast. There is no trace of casting work can\nbe found on this piece.\n\nSo the question really is which emperor in Chinese history was the\nmost probable receiver of this tsuba (once fit itself on a beautiful\nsword as a gift)? Could there be historical record about it that\nmight still be well kept in Japan?\n\nChen, Ying-chaw\nTaipei\n\n\n--- In nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Gordon Robson&quot; &lt;robsongo@s...&gt;\nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Nothing in the folder is Japanese and the dragon tsuba looks like a\ncasting.\n&gt; Also, swords were made for China export by the Ashikaga shoguns\nduring the\n&gt; early Muromachi period and presumably they were mounted with\nJapanese\n&gt; fittings. But I would be very, very surprised if a Chinese emperor,\nor any\n&gt; other Chinese for that matter, would order specific fittings made\nfor such\n&gt; blades.\n&gt;\n&gt; Gordon\n\n"
