It seems that tsuba makers also\nmade sh=\r\nakudo hilts for Rapiers and Short Swords for the Dutch in the\nearly 18th ce=\r\nnt. I have included an excerpt below from the book I am\nreading at the mome=\r\nnt: \n\n[On the topic of Short Swords]\n\n&#39;The Dutch also traded with Japan and=\r\n as a result a variety of wares\nmade by Japanese craftsmen were carried bac=\r\nk to the West. These included\nhilts makde of shakudo, a mixture of copper a=\r\nnd gold, and patinated to a\nrich blue colour to contrast with the gilded pa=\r\nnels of relief\ndecorations set at intervals on the guard, knucklebow and po=\r\nmmel. As\nwith the ivory hilts from Ceylon, contemporary Dutch hilts were th=\r\ne\nprototypes for these exotic pieces. The craftsmen who made them were\nspec=\r\nialists in tsuba, Japanese sword guards, and came from the area\naround Naga=\r\nsaki. The majority of these exotic hilts echo standard\nsmallsword or huntin=\r\ng sword hilts of the 1700&#39;s but hilt forms of the\n1750&#39;s were also copied.&#39;=\r\n\n\nThe author then goes on to illustrate such a Japanese shakudo hilt. It\nac=\r\ntually kind of looks a tiny bit like Mino work. Very remarkable. Now\nhas an=\r\nyone ever seen any of these items first hand? Is this phenomenon\ndocumented=\r\n? Do we know which tsuba makers got involved in this new\nbusiness?\n\nAnd sin=\r\nce the Dutch were ordering them back in the 18th cent, I might\nwant to keep=\r\n my eyes peeled other here, to see if any turn up at auction\nor a local ant=\r\niquefair (I am in The Netherlands). I would be so lucky\nhahahahaha..\n\nRegar=\r\nds, Matthew\n\n \n\n    Z Recruiting Services\n    =93Zurich Toren=94 Muzenstraa=\r\nt 89\n    2511 WB Den Haag\n    T: +31 70 4262273\n    F: +31 70 4262111\n    W=\r\n: zrecruiting.com\n    E: info@...\n    Kijk ook op monsterboard.=\r\nnl, jobbingmall.nl en \n    nationalevacaturebank.nl voor actuele vacatures!=\r\n\n\n---\nOutgoing mail is certified Virus Free.\nChecked by AVG anti-virus syst=\r\nem (http://www.grisoft.com).\nVersion: 6.0.648 / Virus Database: 415 - Relea=\r\nse Date: 31-3-2004\n \n\n\n"
