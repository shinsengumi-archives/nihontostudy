Rather than commissioning pieces to be dedicated to the shrine,\n  most of what was given was the actual weapons used successfully in\n  battle.  Instead of being freshly polished and remounted, the swords\n  were presented &quot;as-is&quot; and for the most part have been retained as\nthey\n  were received. &quot;\n\n  - Matt\n\n\n  ---\n  Outgoing mail is certified Virus Free.\n  Checked by AVG anti-virus system (http://www.grisoft.com).\n  Version: 6.0.471 / Virus Database: 269 - Release Date: 10/04/2003\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\nYahoo!
