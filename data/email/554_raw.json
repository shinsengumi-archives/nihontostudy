Of course everything needs to be considered when looking at a tsuba, but the plate is most important with iron guards and probably the hardest to understand.\n\nNote that when a mixed period tsuba (later decoration or modification of an older plate) is submitted to shinsa, it will usually be dated to its youngest element.  Some mixed period pieces won&#39;t get kanteisho -- I&#39;ve seen a tosho type tsuba that appeared to have sukashi added later than failed.  I&#39;ve never seen a gomoku zogan tsuba submitted, but if it passed at all, I don&#39;t think that an old-plate example would draw an attribution to the maker of the original plate.\n\nSorry to hear about your dog, \nJim\n\n\n\n  Jim -\n\n  I gather from your comments, that as with other iron tsuba,\n  the plate tells the story, not the decor. Some gomoku may\n  have old plates recently decorated; others are recent plates\n  recently decorated. Am I on the right track?\n\n  Rich (of the very ill Master Po)\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
