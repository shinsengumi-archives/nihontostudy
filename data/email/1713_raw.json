Bushu is of course the other name for Musashi province, where Edo/Tokyo is located.  There were many fitting makers living in Bushu.\n\nGiven the variation in the Kunihiro signatures and the quality of the work there may have been more than one person making those tsuba.  Haynes proposes 4 or 5 makers working over the course of 100 years in his Index of Japanese Sword Fittings and Associated Artists. \n\nJim\n\n\n\n  Jim -\n\n  Thanks for the pics. Do I assume that even though he signed\n  Bushu ju, that he was not a member of the Bushu Ito school?\n  I don&#39;t recall seeing anything on him in my Ito school books.\n\n  Rich S\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
