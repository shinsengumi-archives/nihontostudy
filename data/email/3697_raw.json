Will be quite \ninteresting to see if the blade has a mei or not! (Trying to get an atari \nwith my Bungo-to thought!)\n\n&gt;Has anyone else out there been denied access to a nakago? I&#39;m curious.\n\nIn the past fast-approaching 40 years (now that sound scarey!!) I would \nsuspect I&#39;ve been denied access to a nakago perhaps half-dozen times. If you \nhave the opportunity to have the sword in-hand, then at least you can make a \njudgement from the blade&#39;s quality. If buying it from a photo, well, it is a \ngamble and would certainly limit how much you would offer for it because of \nthat gamble. I&#39;ve found that most &quot;owners&quot; will, if you explain it to them \nin a knowledgeable and polite manner, will allow the tsuka to be removed. If \nbuying through the mail, once they learn about the possibility of a \nsignature, curiosity usually takes over and off comes the tsuka. (Always \nimportant to give clear instructions for doing this such as protecting \nhabaki, tsuba, etc., from excessive force!)\n\nWhen looking at a sword that&#39;s presented to you, it is always advisable --  \nfor your own education -- to make a judgement about the blade before looking \nat the nakago. That alone can save you some money by being dazzled by a &quot;big \nmei.&quot; All fun stuff!!\n\nRon\nSTL\n\n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;Mark Jaillet&quot; &lt;mjaillet@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Monday, January 09, 2006 10:04 AM\nSubject: RE: [nihontostudy] need some advices on a sword...\n\n\nHi Patrik,\nI am not nearly as knowledgeable in Nihonto as everyone\nelse on this messege board but I do have an extensive &quot;sales&quot; background. A\ncouple of things come to mind before you buy this piece.\nIf the Seller is knowledgeable in Nihonto, then he would be painfully aware\nof how important it is to the Buyer to examine the nakago. As mentioned\nearlier, this should be a simple process. Taking this one step farther, &quot;if&quot;\nthe seller is knowledgeable, mabe there is something on the nakago that\nhe/she doesn&#39;t want you to see. This would all be related to the asking\nprice of course. If the seller isn&#39;t knowledgeable, have you explained to\nthe seller just how simple it would be to remove the tsuka?\nJust seems &quot;odd&quot; to me. Has anyone else out there been denied access to a\nnakago? I&#39;m curious.\n\nMark Jaillet\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com [mailto:nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com]On\nBehalf Of Patrik Danielsson\nSent: Sunday, January 08, 2006 1:15 PM\nTo: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: [nihontostudy] need some advices on a sword...\n\n\nHello to you all, i was offered this sword, would like some feedback about\nit from you all,the seller dont want to take the tsuka off it, at this\nmoment.
