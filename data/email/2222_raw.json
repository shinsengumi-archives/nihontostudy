Condition counts.\n\nCleaning off rust is of course OK as long as the surface isn&#39;t damaged, but pits will remain and they will count against condition.\n\nA piece that has been cleaned to the point that it looks younger than it should can be a problem.  This is where cleaning out the sukashi openings can hurt you even if you personally like the way that looks.  If the age cues are contradictory, the judgment tends to go to the younger date.  The object of conservation or even restoration is not to make the guard look new.\n\nClear wax isn&#39;t going to help a bad surface at shinsa, but it shouldn&#39;t hurt a good one either.  If an owner really likes his pieces waxy or lives on the ocean it shouldn&#39;t be a big problem, since the wax can be seen through and is not a permanent coating.  I suppose that someone could come up with a way to over do it to the point where the guard looks so strange that the real origin comes into question.  \n\nPolishing guards to the point where the surface becomes shiny and looses surface character is a problem.  Burnishing obscures the traits of the iron necessary for kantei.  It&#39;s really a slower process to get to the same place as resurfacing and/or poor repatination.\n\nLike Ron said, look at all of the great pieces you can get your eyes on and remember them.\nJim\n\n\n\n\n  Hi all,\n\n\n  Jim G&#39;s input on what is acceptable for papers would\n  be interesting.  \n\n  Ken \n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
