Ancient Chinese craftsmen processed \n=\r\nstone meteorites into varieties of item for religious worshipping \npurposes=\r\n. I guess iron meteorites were also used for same purposes. \nOnly they weat=\r\nhered away in time sooner than their stonny counter part. \nI posted once ag=\r\nain 2 iron tsubas onto my folder entitled SOSIDORE. \nThis time they reveale=\r\nd cleared gilded finish. \nI suspeceted they were made of iron meteorite bas=\r\ned on following \nreasons.\n\n1. They are lighter than iron.\nIron meteorites a=\r\nre rarely pure iron. They usually contain nickel. Some \nmeteorites contain =\r\nplenty of iron. They are heavy in weight and \nweathered away much sooner. S=\r\nome iron meteorites contain plenty of \nnickel. They are apparently lighter =\r\nand can better resist weather. The \ntwo iron tsubas showed here are relativ=\r\nely light. They showed \nsuperficial rusting only, evidencing higher content=\r\n of nickel. Initial \nobservations support the idea that they might be once =\r\na part of an iron \nmeteorite with considerable content of nickel.\nThe chise=\r\nled holes revealed a secret about the distribution of \nmaterials within tsu=\r\nbas are not even. Again it points to a possibility \nthat the tsuba material=\r\ns could have been iron-nickel alloy with content \nof which not evenly distr=\r\nibuted. And this is characteristics quite \ncommon in case of meteorite.\n\nI =\r\npurchased these two iron tsubas from a Chinese vendor who used to \nsell ant=\r\niques. There is strong possibility these twp artifacts were \nunearthed in C=\r\nhina.\n\nThey way these 2 iron tsubas gilded was typical Chinese. However, I =\r\nam \npretty sure that in Japan mirror craftsman followed exactly same method=\r\n \nin treating mirror surface with mercury. The same technique can come \nout=\r\n with gilded finish when adding gold-grains into the mixture of \nrubbed-on =\r\nmaterials. \n\nNow, I am wondering if these two iron tsubas were of Japanese =\r\norigin.\n\nThe most convincing clues of all are the inscriptions. \n1. Chinese=\r\n way of arranging characters always comes from top down and \nfrom left to r=\r\night. In this case. They are to be read from top down \nthen left to right.\n=\r\n2. The content of inscriptions are typical Japanese.\n3. The style of fonts =\r\nare typically Japanese.\n\nThe three points mentioned excluded the possibilit=\r\ny that they were \noriginally made in China. Even if they were once contract=\r\ned with \nChinese craftsmen made to Japanese order the font of characters \nc=\r\noncerned betrayed the fact that Chinese people never trained to write \nnor =\r\nprocessed kanji onto surface of any materials in Japanese style. \nOnly Japa=\r\nnese can..  \n\nFor sure these two iron trubas are not isolated case. I wonde=\r\nr where \nare the rest of them and in what form? Anyone knows any record abo=\r\nut \niron meteorite processed into any other type of items that became part =\r\n\nof Nihonto?\n\nSOSIDORE\nChen, Ying-chaw\nTaipei\n\n\n\n\n\n"
