Can\n&gt; you direct me to a book I am likely to have where it may be found?\n&gt;       You raised a question earlier, is the taste in schools like  \n&gt; Jingo\n&gt; &quot;learned&quot; because the books and teachers all say it is good? I think\n&gt; that quality has to be &quot;taught&quot;, you have to see and compare many\n&gt; fine examples to discern it. The teachers taste though may not become\n&gt; the students. Alan makes a good point, in that we have to know the\n&gt; tastes of the times to understand why certain themes and materials\n&gt; were used and what was seen as masterwork in one era may not compare\n&gt; well to those of another time. However we don&#39;t have to blindly\n&gt; follow the fashions of the past.\n&gt;       If you like it, you like it. Buy and collect what you like.  \n&gt; What we\n&gt; see as clunky and rustic in a bad way, appealed to someone at some\n&gt; point or your tsuba would not exist. It seems you like it and it\n&gt; found you, thats a good thing.\n&gt; -t\n&gt;\n&gt; YAHOO!
