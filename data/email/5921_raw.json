It was found\non the body of Commander Goichi Oya (Commander of Japanese forces on Tinian\nIsland during WW II), who committed Seppuku in a cave on the Island during\nthe US invasion. The body and the Tanto were found by a US Marine named\nFred Osgood who was awarded the Bronze Star and a Purple Heart. He sent the\nTanto home in 1944 after the action on Tinian Island, and it was in his\npossession since his return from the war until November of 2012 when it\ncame into my possession.\n\nThe Tanto is 13 1/16&quot; long with 3 3/8&quot; being the Nakago (As measured from\nthe Tsuba notch). It is 0.229&quot; thick just in front of the notch. The Nakago\ntapers to 0.115 at it&#39;s end (See attached file image).\n\nAt this point I am wondering if any one has more information on this\nparticular, or type of,  Tanto.\n\nWhat I have found so far is that Commander Giochi Oya was A Commander in\nthe Imperial Japanese Navy, and Commander of the IJN 56th guard Unit, with\nhis head Quarters at Mt. Lasso, Tinian Island. He was responsible for the\ndefenses of the four air fields on Tinian Island. There on Tinian Island he\ncommitted Seppuku  August 2, 1944.\n\nThanks in advance for any information available,\n\nEd.\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
