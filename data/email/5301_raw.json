It is ofte=\r\nn applied to work that  is in Goto style but is not Goto\nmain or sideline w=\r\nork. Edo-kinko used to  be used similarly for work in the\nstyle of Edo regi=\r\non machibori kinko  schools, but lately this is generally\nlumped as &quot;Kyo-ki=\r\nnko&quot; as well. So it  truly is a grab bag, but the problem\n(especially with =\r\nmenuki) is that there  is so much Edo period kinko work with\nno unique char=\r\nacter to it that makes  it possible to give a more specific\nattribution.\n\nB=\r\nTW, generic Edo  period kinko work of lower quality than Kyo-kinko is\nattri=\r\nbuted to  Kyo-kanagushi.\n\nJim\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: ROBSON  G=\r\nordon\nTo: nihontostudy@  &lt;mailto:nihontostudmailto:nihontostmai&gt;  yahoogrou=\r\nps.  \nSent: Wednesday, February 27, 2008 4:23 PM\nSubject:  Re: [nihontostud=\r\ny] Kyo-kinko\n\nHi Ron,\n\nMy understanding is that  Kyo-Kinko is the new name =\r\nfor Waki-Goto. This would\n\nmake them a grab  bag like Ko-Kinko or even Shoa=\r\nmi. Their dates are post-Ko-\nKinko, so early  Edo to Bakumatsu. There is a =\r\nKyo-Kinko book out there.
