My Akas=\r\naka of this design signed\n  Tadashige (to my relief) passed shinsa in Chica=\r\ngo. Of course I have it\n  here in front of me now to compare the work with =\r\nyour tsuba. While the\n  design is the same, the work on mine is more delica=\r\nte (?)--more\n  piercing--and seems to &quot;flow&quot; more, if you know what I mean.=\r\n The\n  horse&#39;s hoofs on your tsuba are more &quot;squared&quot; and &quot;bold&quot; than the m=\r\nore\n  naturally shaped hoofs on my tsuba. I just saw a similar tsuba\n  (pic=\r\nture) just the other day that showed these rather boldly made hoofs\n  and i=\r\nt was called something other than Akasaka, but for the life of me\n  I don&#39;t=\r\n recall where I saw this. Thought it was in the new Mosle&#39;\n  catalogue, but=\r\n if so, I&#39;m not finding it now. My tsuba came out of a\n  large collection o=\r\nf tsuba sold in Santiago, Chile in 2003. That\n  collection also had another=\r\n similar &quot;horse&quot; tsuba that had these large\n  hoofs like your new tsuba, bu=\r\nt I didn&#39;t buy that one. Most of these\n  730-plus tsuba were bought up by M=\r\nichael Zomber, so perhaps your&#39;s\n  could be the one I saw. I&#39;ll check my re=\r\ncords. \n\n  Ron\n  STL\n    ----- Original Message ----- \n    From: Richard Tu=\r\nrner \n    To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n    Sent: Thursday, September 3=\r\n0, 2004 2:13 AM\n    Subject: [nihontostudy] Akasaka tsuba ?\n\n\n    All, I ha=\r\nd a tsuba arrive today, it is a lot better in hand than the \n    original i=\r\nmages I purchased it from showed.
