Not all of us have the bandwidth to\n  ferret out posts on the NMB, awesome as it is. This group was great\n  precisely because it all came effortlessly to your email and you could\n  decide what to read, file or delete.\n\n  Best,\n\n  Andy\n\n  On Fri, Nov 25, 2011 at 2:39 PM, Craig Harris &lt;bridgeofdreams@...&gt;wrote:\n\n  &gt; Brian, Curran, Dean and all,\n  &gt;\n  &gt; I had meant to write to Dean privately when I read his original message the\n  &gt; other day, but got busy with the Thanksgiving holiday.\n  &gt;\n  &gt; Even though I am &#39;out of business&#39; as a bookseller, I would be glad to help\n  &gt; out with identification, price suggestions, and any other assistance I can\n  &gt; provide. In some cases I still may have &quot;want lists&quot; from clients who are\n  &gt; still looking for certain books, and I&#39;m glad to do what I can to put\n  &gt; people and books together - that was the real thrill of bookselling.\n  &gt;\n  &gt; Dean, in most cases a photo of the cover will be enough for identification,\n  &gt; though in some cases a shot of the colophon page with the publication\n  &gt; information will be needed where there are significant differences between\n  &gt; editions.\n  &gt;\n  &gt; The email list(s) are decidedly not the best place to offer books like\n  &gt; these. I don&#39;t know what the subscriber counts are, but the nearly complete\n  &gt; lack of traffic tells the story. The Nihonto Message Board is where the\n  &gt; action and the collectors are, for the most part.\n  &gt;\n  &gt; I did close my business for health reasons, and my remaining Asia-related\n  &gt; stock is being handled by Paragon Books, but I recently found a few\n  &gt; &quot;stragglers&quot; that I&#39;ll be offering on NMB. I&#39;m in the process of moving\n  &gt; over the next month or so to smaller, rented, quarters, but I&#39;m still alive\n  &gt; and interested and willing to help out wherever I can. I recently put\n  &gt; together a Hawley&#39;s offered there with someone I knew who had been looking\n  &gt; for a copy.\n  &gt;\n  &gt; Dean or anyone can drop me a line or call,\n  &gt;\n  &gt; Craig\n  &gt; bridgeofdreams@...\n  &gt; 847-846-7701 (cell)\n  &gt;\n  &gt; On Fri, Nov 25, 2011 at 11:32 AM, sigp210 &lt;sigp210@...&gt; wrote:\n  &gt;\n  &gt; &gt; **\n  &gt; &gt;\n  &gt; &gt;\n  &gt; &gt; Curran,\n  &gt; &gt; Don&#39;t you think it might be a good idea to get hold of Craig from the\n  &gt; &gt; Ex-Bridge of Dreams? Although he was recently forced to close his Nihonto\n  &gt; &gt; Book business, I am sure he is still very good at suggesting prices and\n  &gt; &gt; would know most of the books. Might even be able to assist with moving\n  &gt; many\n  &gt; &gt; of them or be able to advise.\n  &gt; &gt;\n  &gt; &gt; Brian\n  &gt; &gt;\n  &gt; &gt;\n  &gt; &gt; --- In nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com, Curran Campbell &lt;neobliviscar@...&gt;\n  &gt; &gt; wrote:\n  &gt; &gt; &gt;\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; Dean,\n  &gt; &gt; &gt;\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; Though I was not introduced to your father until late in life, he and I\n  &gt; &gt; had two wonderful discussions on Bizen blades.\n  &gt; &gt; &gt;\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; I hope his books go to excellent homes.
