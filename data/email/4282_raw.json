You can patch the page into the altavista link \nfor a &#39;t=\r\nranslation&#39; although we all know how Japanese to English \ntranslates by now=\r\n.  On the left side of the page there are a series \nof lectures which have =\r\nmany examples to see, both sword and \nfittings.  Lecture three has several =\r\nEzo examples.\n\nOK Alan, here is a further quote from Buttweiler;\n\n     &#39;The=\r\n surface of Ezo Menuki were originally covered by a thick \nlayer of Gold ap=\r\nplied as an amalgam.  The Gold was burnished with a \nrather large needle wh=\r\nich left well defined polishing marks.  The \nGold used for the overlay was =\r\nof very low karat.  The resulting color \nis a very pale Silver-Golden hue. =\r\n The Gold will frequently be worn \nfrom the high spots leaving a black Shak=\r\nudo-like patina&#39;.\n\nI have a feeling that much of what we see tody are the r=\r\nemnants of \nfield worn gear.  This might explain the relatively poor condit=\r\nion of \nmany of these very early fittings.  Fine pieces for the commanders =\r\nor \nDaimyo were passed on as family treasures or left to shrines.  The \nvas=\r\nt majority of the rest were simply lost to battle or to time.  \n\n\n\n\n"
