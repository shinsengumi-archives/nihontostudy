I have seen many other\nso-called J=\r\napanese swords with serial numbers on the blade, and these\nwere almost all =\r\nChinese fakes. For some reason, they think this\nincreases the value or legi=\r\ntimacy.\nAfter the war, most of the civilian swords (bar a few identified as=\r\n\nart objects) were confiscated, not registered.\nThere is very little chance=\r\n of tracking down the original owners or\nhistory of 99% of these swords.\n\nR=\r\negards,\nBrian\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Hello David - \n&gt; \n&gt; Welcome and Happy 2006 to you too. \n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; If you have a sword with a serial number stamped on it (on the\nblade) =\r\nthen you have a mass produced so-called &quot;factory made&quot; sword.\nSometimes you=\r\n will find some numbers stamped on the nakago (tang) of a\nsword, usually tw=\r\no or three digits, which in that case might relate to\n&quot;assembly&quot; numbers; t=\r\nhese same numbers are often repeated on seppa,\ntsuba, etc. Swords were &quot;reg=\r\nistered&quot; after the war and continue to be\nso today, but the Japanese govern=\r\nment never required anything\n(registration numbers) to be stamped on swords=\r\n. \n&gt; \n&gt; Ron\n&gt; STL\n&gt;   ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt;   From: dpoll64 \n&gt;   =\r\nTo: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n&gt;   Sent: Wednesday, January 04, 2006 3:1=\r\n2 PM\n&gt;   Subject: [nihontostudy] SERIAL NUMBERS ON JAPANESE SWORDS\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\n  Firstly, happy  new  year and nice  to meeet  you  all.
