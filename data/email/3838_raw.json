Usually kodogu is just displayed for study.  We did tsuba kantei a couple of times in the NY club.  I made a small wooden clamp that would cover up the seppa dai but still allow the tsuba to be picked up.  I haven&#39;t seen it done elsewhere.  Doing kantei kai of mumei items is a little problematic since the &quot;right&quot; answer is still an opinion rather than a fact.\n\nDoing it online has the handicap of not being able to see everything about the piece, but of course that&#39;s true too of paper kantei contests for swords.  It could be done if someone has the time.  It&#39;d be easy enough to Photoshop out signatures.\n\nJim\n\n\n\n  Greeting&#39;s all. I guess this question may be directed to Jim more than\n  anyone else, but I am sure others will be more than keen to jump in if\n  they feel so inclined.\n\n  Are there ever any or many Tsuba or Tosogu Kantei ? I am sure there are\n  at group/club meetings and such but I was thinking more in line with the\n  Nihonto Kantei the NTHK offer in their monthly or Kenji Mishina offers\n  on-line.\n\n  The recent post&#39;s in regards to David and Curran&#39;s guards, with the\n  answers that ensued, got me thinking it would be great to see maybe 1/2\n  a dozen tsuba offered up each month for kantei. I guess the usual\n  aspects of kantei would remain the same, i.e. style, type of work, size,\n  thickness, tekkotsu if there and either an image with the mei ( if\n  applicable ) hidden or some sort.\n\n  Just a thought, sounds like fun to me :-)\n\n  any thought&#39;s on this ?\n\n  Cheers\n\n  Rich.\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
