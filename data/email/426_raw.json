However, I have to say that Akasaka would be difficult to defend.  That mokko shape would be very unusual for Akasaka.  Their seppa dai tended to be more narrow and were often somewhat to very pointed at the top in the early generations.  The broad shape would be, again unusual.  They didn&#39;t normally do quadrilateral symmetry like that and the hitsuana are also not typical, although Tadashige often made &quot;dovetails&quot; for (often non-existent) sekigane like we see here on the kozuka ana side.  Akasaka construction often used a hard, smooth kawagane that looks quite different from the texture of the iron on this guard.  The rim is usually very round in the early generations.\n\nBUT... there are a bunch of signed Akasaka guards by later generations that are not obviously in Akasaka style based on the carving, motifs and even inlay.  It&#39;s an interesting study.   The first Akasaka died around 1657, FWIW.  Pretty sure it&#39;s not an Akasaka piece, though.\n\nWriting opinions is a great way to learn.  Keep it up and don&#39;t worry about the feet.  You did good.\n\nJim\n\n\n  This is my totally uninformed novice opinion. So feel free to put your\n  foot in if I am way off base here.  Anyway with that disclaimer gone\n  here goes (I have to try sometime haha)\n\n  My first guess would be Kyoto for the first tsuba, second guess Akasaka,\n  whatever it is dating to the (early) 1600&#39;s\n\n  Second tsuba: I am inclined to agree with Tom, early simple Onin. \n\n  How did I do ? \n\n  - Matt \n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
