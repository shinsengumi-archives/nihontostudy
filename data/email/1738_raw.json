From what I can see the rust is\nvery deep.  The fact that it is so deep is not a good thing because a\npolisher will need to go just as deep to remove it from the sword.  It&#39;s\nnot about having a soft hand as a polisher; it&#39;s about how deep the rust\nactually is.  Going that deep in a sword can bring up fukure, shintetsu\nand other flaws.  Not to mention the fact that the sword&#39;s hamon can\nalso get softer after going down deep like that.  The nakago was worked\non in some way, perhaps a false signature was removed?  I don&#39;t know.\nIn any case to me the sword looks like a Shinto blade but that&#39;s just my\nhumble opinion.  Now for some good news, it is very possible for swords\nin this condition to polish out properly and become fine looking swords.\nBut just take your time, because the expense and risk involved in the\nrestoration of such a sword is not inexpensive.\n\n \n\nMoses Becerra\n\n \n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Peter Farrar [mailto:pcfarrar@...] \nSent: Wednesday, March 17, 2004 6:42 AM\nTo: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: [nihontostudy] Will this Katana polish?\n\n \n\nHi,\n\nCan anyone give me an opinion if this Katana blade would polish?\n\nI believe it to be a shinshinto Katana, the blade (cutting edge 26 \n1/4&quot;) is very heavy and thick.\n\nIts badly corroded and pitted on one side of the blade, the other \nside has only minor pitting and corrosion. The worst areas (deep \npitting) are pictured in the link. The blade is still very sharp \nalong the entire edge. The hamon is not visible at all.\n\nThanks for any help.\n\nImages:\n\nhttp://www.c.farrar.btinternet.co.uk/kat/\n\nPeter\n\n\n\n\n  _____  \n\nYahoo!
