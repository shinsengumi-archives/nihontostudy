He is carrying an\nuchigatana with a tsuba, however it&#39;s rather difficult to say whether it\nmight be made of iron, yamagane or leather.\n\n    Gordon - do you have any sort of image of the nagamaki tsuba?  Is it a\nplain iron plate without sukashi?\n\n    Jim\n\n\n\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n        Yahoo!
