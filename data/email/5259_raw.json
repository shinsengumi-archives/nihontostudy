There is a good bit of\n  information on them in Art & Sword Vol. 3, the Owari\n  Tsuba book, and even a book dedicated entirely to\n  their work and that of a few of their students.\n\n  Question: Has anyone ever seen a tsuba signed by\n  both Gen1 (&#39;Niwa&#39; Norisuke) and by Gen2 (&#39;Iwata&#39;\n  Norisuke)?\n  I would think there would be more than a few, as\n  their lives overlapped a good bit.\n\n  There are no joint signed examples in the books, so\n  I&#39;m hoping someone has seen or owns a joint work.\n\n  Thank you in advance,\n\n  Curran\n\n  __________________________________________________________\n  Never miss a thing.
