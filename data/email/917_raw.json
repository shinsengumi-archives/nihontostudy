First looks like a Bushu Ito and the second a cut down Katchushi.  The hitsu were usually put in later.  I have seen some of these large Kozuka hitsu in Momoyama and early Edo tsuba.\n\nJohn\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: Ron Polansky \n  To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Friday, October 17, 2003 12:10 PM\n  Subject: [nihontostudy] (unknown)\n\n\n  List:\n\n  I have a couple of tsuba I was wondering if the list would help me \n  with-\n  First one:\n  http://www.nihontophile.com/Sukashi1.jpg\n  http://www.nihontophile.com/Sukashi2.jpg\n  (nice heavy tsuba, 3 1/8&quot;)\n  I think Bizen Shoami or some school related to Bushu or Ito (I think \n  late Edo).\n  Any other ideas?\n\n  Second one:\n  http://www.nihontophile.com/KoKat1.jpg\n  http://www.nihontophile.com/KoKat2.jpg\n  (very thin, slightly under 3&quot;. purplish iron with remnants of lacquer \n  on the plate)\n  I think Ko-Katchushi. pre-Edo to Momoyama.\n  Is the kozuka ana original? It is huge...\n\n  Thanks for looking,\n  Ron P.\n\n\n\n        Yahoo!
