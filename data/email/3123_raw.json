(lot no 722) It then goes on to list a few pages of Kyo \ntsuba.  It would seem that by their working definition that Curran&#39;s \nexplanation of Ko-Kyo might be correct given that the Heianjo is \nearly-mid 15th C while the others are more than a century later.  \n\n--- In nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com, Gordon Robson &lt;robsongo@s...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; Hi,\n&gt; \n&gt; The old term Heianjo Sukashi is no longer in use having been \nreplaced \n&gt; by Kyo-Sukushi. If you have an older book, you will still see this \n&gt; term. This also helps avoid confusion with Heianjo tsuba, which \nare \n&gt; typically thin iron plates with brass inlays.\n&gt; \n&gt; Gordon\n&gt; \n&gt; On 2005/07/11, at 1:54, Curran Campbell wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; I think I asked this same question of Jim or somebody\n&gt; &gt; else not long ago. It confused me a bit regarding a\n&gt; &gt; tsuba I was studying at the time.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; My understanding is that it is more of an age\n&gt; &gt; division. For example, exact same Sasano tsuba is\n&gt; &gt; photographed in 2 books. It is a mid 1500s piece. In\n&gt; &gt; the older book it is called &#39;Heian Jo Sukashi&#39;. In\n&gt; &gt; another book it is called &#39;Kyo Sukashi&#39; and the age is\n&gt; &gt; denoted in the subsequent description.\n&gt; &gt;   I suppose you could call it a &quot;ko kyo&quot; sukashi, but\n&gt; &gt; sounds odd to me.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I would have thought Richard George&#39;s first tsuba\n&gt; &gt; could be called &quot;Heianjo Sukashi&quot; or late Muromachi.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Curran\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- David Zincavage &lt;jdz@i...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; I&#39;m a bit puzzled about Heianjo sukashi tsubas.  Why\n&gt; &gt;&gt; do you suppose it is that neither Torigoye nor\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Sasano discuss them?  Heianjo, in this case, I would\n&gt; &gt;&gt; assume, just means they were made in Kyoto.  So, how\n&gt; &gt;&gt; would Heianjo sukashi be different from  Kyo\n&gt; &gt;&gt; sukashi?  How does one identify these?\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been\n&gt; &gt;&gt; removed]\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \t\t\n&gt; &gt; ____________________________________________________\n&gt; &gt; Sell on Yahoo!
