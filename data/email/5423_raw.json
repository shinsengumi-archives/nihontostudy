The hamon is mostl=\r\ny a narrow suguha, the nioi is wide and deep. and there is ashi and sometim=\r\nes yo.  \nThe boshi is ko maru or o maru on a small kissaki.  The nakago is =\r\nha agiri kurijiri.  \nThe mei is usually cut in the center of the nakago, cu=\r\nt with a fine chisel but the kanji are large and deep cut.\n\nThe Sue Mihara =\r\nworked in the Muromachi period from the end of the Nambokucho period. \nThey=\r\n made mostly katana, wakizashi and tanto.  \nThe quality of their work was n=\r\not of the standard of the earlier generations and was inferior. \nThey made =\r\nmostly shinogi zukiri blades and the style and shape of the blades was simi=\r\nlar to the Ko Mihara, but not as elegant or well proportioned.  \nThey tempe=\r\nred in a suguha as did the earlier smiths but it is wider and also a gunome=\r\n midare.  \nQuite often there is usually utsuri present and blades with very=\r\n little or no activity in the ha are the most common.  \nThe mei is cut smal=\r\nler and not as deep as the earlier generations. and are cut closer to the m=\r\nune, and the mei are longer.\n\nIn general the older blades are more elegant =\r\nand better proportioned and the ji is much darker.\n\nI hope this helps a lit=\r\ntle.\n\nJohn\n\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: Maximo Marchionni \n  To=\r\n: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Tuesday, June 17, 2008 11:08 AM\n  S=\r\nubject: [nihontostudy] Waki in Argentina\n\n\n  Hello to every one.\n  Some fri=\r\nend found a Mihara Masiye, Bingo prov. wakizashi.\n  And he ask me for some =\r\ncharacteristics.\n  Does any one have some info about this smith?
