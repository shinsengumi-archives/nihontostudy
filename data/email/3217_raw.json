Yumoto&#39;s is a magnificent pocket reference, \n  although a bit dated. The Connoisseur&#39;s is a much more detailed \n  reference, covering the same ground as Yumoto&#39;s, but with more \n  examples of every feature a nihonto can have. Curiously enough, every \n  now and then I see it being offered on eBay, sometimes reaching bid \n  amounts above 100 dollars. For the life of me, I can&#39;t understand \n  why. Not that the book isn&#39;t worth it, but because it&#39;s still \n  available off the shelf at Amazon for less than 50 bucks: \n  http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?path=ASIN/4770020716&link_code=as2&camp=1789&tag=lairofthenecr-20&creative=9325\n\n  Now, that being said, the Connoisseur&#39;s is probably the best \n  reference available in English. It pales in comparison to published \n  in Japan nihonto reference books which can make the Connoisseur&#39;s \n  look like the pocket reference version.\n\n  Lastly, another book I found to be a good read, especially as it \n  covers nihonto manufacture, is The Craft of the Japanese Sword, by \n  Leon Kapp, also available from Amazon: \n  http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?path=ASIN/087011798X&link_code=as2&camp=1789&tag=lairofthenecr-20&creative=9325\n\n  Hope that helps.\n\n  Regards,\n\n  Andres\n\n  At 08:39 AM 8/4/2005, you wrote:\n  &gt;Guess you&#39;re missing Andres point here.
