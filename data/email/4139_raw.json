It is rustic, it is  \nrough, yes but all the materials are worked and presented just so.  \nNothing more needs to be added, little or nothing could be removed  \nwithout destroying the presentation.\n\tWas the first Jingo master a rustic who simply did things his way  \nnaturally with no thought as to the outcome? or was he as Hagihara  \nhas suggested a genius, who was repelled by the trends in kinko work  \naround him, and inspired by the tea culture of his time to create  \nworks shockingly different from any other artist of his time?\n\tI can&#39;t answer the question, but I agree that if you compare the  \nbest of Jingo to other kinko works, it is shockingly different, it is  \nsolid, quiet but powerful and very befitting a samurai. A pleasant  \nshock indeed, and I think  genius as well...\n-t\n\nOn Apr 14, 2006, at 8:56 AM, bungotakadasword wrote:\n\n&gt; all of you diss the hawk tsuba as some sort of &quot; mono &quot;........  \n&gt; base on\n&gt; the ugly execution of the bird.\n&gt; Now tell me........ you find the eagle/hawk as portrait in Jingo tsuba\n&gt; ugly ?
