I will post pics as soon as possible.  I \n&gt; live on the east coast of North Carolina (Cape Lookout, Cape \n&gt; Hatteras). Would anyone happen to know a reliable source nearby who \n&gt; could look at it in hand.\n&gt;   Some one asked me if I could take the handle off.  I have and there \n&gt; are no markings anywhere that &quot;I&quot; can see.  I haven&#39;t cleaned the \n&gt; tang so there may be something  I&#39;m not seeing.  Only light file \n&gt; marks that have faded quite considerably if not gone altogether.  \n&gt; Thanks again for the help.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo!
