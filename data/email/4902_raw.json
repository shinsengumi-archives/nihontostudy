It is all about the &#39;level of force&#39; needed to \nprotect=\r\n ones life from deadly harm. I too, am in law enforcment; I \nwork as a corr=\r\nections deputy. The levels of force are studied yearly \nin order to keep ce=\r\nrtification.\n\nBut, I know of no thief who doesn&#39;t carry at least a screw dr=\r\niver and \nwhen used properly, can be a deadly weapon. So rather than get su=\r\ned \nfor maiming him (her) for life, I will prove beyond a reasonable \ndoubt=\r\n, that the thief came after me to do bodily harm and thats why I \nkilled hi=\r\nm.\n\nI rest my case.\n\nElliott\n\n--- In nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com, &quot;sigp210=\r\n&quot; &lt;sigp210@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Here in South Africa we don&#39;t need any permits o=\r\nr permissions to own\n&gt; any edged weapons. \n&gt; Self defence is allowed, and a=\r\nny available weapon would be ok, as \nlong\n&gt; as there was serious risk to li=\r\nfe.\n&gt; Lethal force in defence of property is not encouraged, and can lead \n=\r\nto\n&gt; charges.
