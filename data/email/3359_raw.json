The kozuka is in Goto style, but in the photos it looks like what is usually described as Kyo-Kinko at shinsa.  The metal, carving, nanako, etc., are in the style, but not up to the level of Goto work.  The urasogi is unusual in copy work.\n\nJim\n\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: Dr John P Lissenden \n  To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Saturday, September 24, 2005 11:18 AM\n  Subject: [nihontostudy] Another kodzuka for identification ...\n\n\n  Once again I am shamelessly using your combined expertise to my own \n  ends.\n\n  The kodzuka illustrated in my photo album JPL is ex the Ransom \n  collection.  Within a raised rim, on a panel of fine horizontal \n  shakudo nanako, is a group of fruit, flowers and vegetation depicted \n  in high relief.  The fruit and flowers are of gold, the leaves and \n  stems of shakudo with gold drops of water.  There is a second, \n  smaller group nearter to the blade.  The reverse is of polished \n  shakudo with a segment, including the butt, of gold with delicate \n  draw scratching.  The kodzuka is uninscribed.\n\n  This appears to be Goto work of a high quality, but I am completely \n  inadequate for any attemt to identify the maker solely on the basis \n  of the image and style.\n\n  Can anybody please help.  See http://tinyurl.com/77rxt\n\n  With thanks, JPL.\n\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
