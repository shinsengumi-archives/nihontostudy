Of course, by this time I imagine the aoi mon was being used as a &quot;decorator&quot; item by all and sundry with no fear of losing one&#39;s head!!  As Peter observed, if the habaki is a high quality item it points more to my first suggestion and if poorer quality then to the second.  Here in Australia there is a Koto wakizashi by (I think) IESUKE (nijimei) that has a solid gold niju habaki with a sukashi Oda mon.  The quality is just excellent, but is it a &quot;connection/allegiance&quot; piece or a &quot;decorator&quot;??  Without a large number of documented similar pieces we will never know.\n\nBarry Thomas\n\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: Ron Hartmann \n  To: token_kenkyu_kai@... ; nihontostudy ; nihonto@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Monday, April 02, 2007 6:41 AM\n  Subject: [nihonto] Yamon Naokatsu\n\n\n  Hi all - \n\n  Does anyone know of any connection that Yamon Naokatsu (2nd generation) had with the Tokugawa? Reason I ask, I have a short katana by Shoji Yamon Naokatsu (dated Meiji 4 - 1871) which has a silver habaki with the Tokugawa aoi crest on it in sukashi (pierced). I believe this habaki was original to the sword (not a collector&#39;s replacement) but so far I&#39;ve yet to find some connection between the smith and the Tokugawa. \n\n  Thanks,\n\n  Ron\n  STL\n  .\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
