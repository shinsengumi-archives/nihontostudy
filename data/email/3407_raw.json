That&#39;s a nice tsuba for $10.00, be very happy with it.\n\nKyo  does refer to Kyoto, as Kyoto was the political hub of Japan during \nthe Muromachi period. So Kyo Sukashi works may have started in the mid \nlate 1400&#39;s but I am unsure if Kyo Shoami started that early but they \ncertainly began in the late Muromachi era.\n\nYou guard looks typical of the late 17th to early 18th century pieces I \nthink. That&#39;s just my hunch. I may be wrong.\n\nHitsu ana Ume were used to fill the Hitsu ana when there were no Kozuka \nor Kogai used on the koshirae. It was an aesthetic thing I think. No \nneed for holes when there&#39;s nothing to put in them. In your tsubas case, \nthere would have been a Kozuka, but no Kogai, so the Kogai hole was \nfilled, with Shakudo covered copper mostly.\n\nThe Sekigane that fills the nakago ana is a packer or filler to ensure \nthe blade fits snugly on the nakago. This tsuba was most likely been \nfitted to a second or even third sword in it&#39;s life.\n\nI have seen furniture from the Meiji period were tsuba have been mounted \nin door of cabinets and the likes but I don&#39;t think they wore them as \npendants if that&#39;s what you mean :-) I think they were used mostly as \ntsuba. Though I think a few very special pieces ( Maybe Ko Goto and the \nlikes ) were probably stored away and kept in safe places.\n\nThere were not to many wars in Japan after the Tokugawa took over so it \nis unlikely this tsuba has seen battle, unless a one on one.\n\nhope that helps some.\n\nRichard\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
