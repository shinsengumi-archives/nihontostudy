However, even \nsword-smiths\n&gt; &gt; are given onyomi or Sino-J=\r\napanese nicknames. Perhaps the most \nfamous is\n&gt; &gt; Nagayoshi, who is typica=\r\nlly called Chogi. There is also \nHiroyoshi, whose\n&gt; &gt; nickname is Hiroga. T=\r\neimei may be a Japanese nickname for \nSadanobu. I am\n&gt; &gt; pretty sure you wo=\r\nuld read his signature using the kunyomi. On \nthe other\n&gt; &gt; hand, there are=\r\n lots of fittings makers whose name is read using \nthe onyomi\n&gt; &gt; -- Tomei,=\r\n Somin, all the Goto guys.
