The shinsa team was quite busy with\n  many interesting items from the UK, the continent and beyond.  It was nice\n  to meet the collectors &quot;over there&quot; after exchanging email over the years,\n  although unfortunately there was very little time to talk while the shinsa\n  was under way.   If anyone has questions, please ask.\n\n  Jim\n\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Yahoo!
