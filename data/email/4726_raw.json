You would be better off going to Bugei forum or International \n&gt; Sword Forum and asking. The members here are true conservationists and \n&gt; what you are suggest is grating on many nerves. This is not something \n&gt; that is offered in this day and age as a rule, as Mr Robson has noted it \n&gt; is not really done by the top togi in Japan. Most Hi are polished out \n&gt; over time and eventually almost disappear.\n&gt;\n&gt; Don&#39;t feel you are being attacked personally. it is just that most true \n&gt; Nihontophiles consider this a blasphemy of sorts.\n&gt;\n&gt; Cheers\n&gt;\n&gt; Richard\n&gt;\n&gt; Enore Gardonio wrote:\n&gt;   \n&gt;&gt; Its a Shinto blade not Koto. If I do put the hi on it will not be for\n&gt;&gt; whistling purposes. What makes people think that I would shallowly ruin\n&gt;&gt; an old blade. I see no reason why the blade cannot be used for Iaido and\n&gt;&gt; adding a hi on it does not ruin the blade, if done by a proper smith in\n&gt;&gt; Japan. The blade can still be appreciated. We are obviously looking at\n&gt;&gt; this from opposite ends. If done correctly and I presented you with the\n&gt;&gt; blade for the first time you would probably not know that it was modified.\n&gt;&gt; Enore\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Date: 12/6/2006 4:39 PM\n&gt;&gt;   \n&gt;&gt;     \n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt; Yahoo!
