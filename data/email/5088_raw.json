He won&#39;t talk to me directly, only through an \narms dealer friend of his who has asked me to help out as he himself knows \nnothing about Nihonto.  I find this very unsatisfactory and have declined to \nhelp out.  However, I&#39;m writing an email to the bloke I know who is the \nfriend of the wealthy man outlining my reasons for not engaging, pointing \nout the difficulties involved, and recommending his friend/customer do his \nown internet research.\n\nSo, I&#39;m looking at your site to give a &quot;pointer&quot; example of a good sword to \nbuy with koshirae, and discovered this:\n\nRyumon Nobuyoshi\nKamakura Koto (ca. 1288), with koshirae\nNBTHK Juyo Token, a particularly important piece.\n$74,000 -consignment-\n\nTrouble is, the link on the sword name Ryumon Nobuyoshi to more detail is:\nhttp://www.nihonto.ca/taima/\n\nwhich is of course the link to the Yamato Taima/Taema below.  However, the \nlink on the blade itself is correct.\nhttp://www.nihonto.ca/ryumon-nobuyoshi/\n\nBest regards,\nBarry Thomas.\n\n\n"
