I am correct in thinking your translation was actually just\npublished very recently, right?  And Tokyo would be the place of\npublication, I presume?\n\n  The concept of an auspicious day is pleasant to think of.\n\n\n\n    ----- Original Message -----\n    From: Gordon Robson\n    To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com\n    Sent: Monday, June 30, 2003 4:49 PM\n    Subject: RE: [nihontostudy] Hizen Handbook\n\n\n    Hi David,\n\n    Published by JSSUS, and yes, the translation was done a long time ago.\n    Kichijitsu = auspicious day as in sword signatures.\n\n    Gordon\n      -----Original Message-----\n      From: David Zincavage [mailto:jdz@...]\n      Sent: Tuesday, July 01, 2003 8:27 AM\n      To: token_kenkyu_kai@...; nihonto@...;\n    nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com\n      Subject: [nihontostudy] Hizen Handbook\n\n\n      My copy of Mr. Robson translation of Eguchi&#39;s Hizento Hikkei arrived\ntoday\n      from Mr. Watson.  I find it necessary to keep a list of the titles I\nown\n      (senility) to keep from ordering duplicates, and when I was entering\nthis\n      book on my list, I found no publisher, place, or date of publication\n    listed.\n\n      My impression is that the JSS/US was the publisher, is that correct?\nMr.\n      Robson refers to &quot;an auspicious day&quot; in 1997.  This just appeared, did\nit\n      not?\n\n      What, by the way, is the Japanese for &quot;auspicious day?&quot;\n\n\n\n            Yahoo!
