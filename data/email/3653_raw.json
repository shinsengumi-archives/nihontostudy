Mr Robinson and his publications were a highly valuable source of pre-electronic information on Nihonto.  He is much admired and highly respected, and was indeed a real scholar.  Sincere condolences to his family and colleagues.\n    Malcolm Cox\n\n\n    At 10:22 PM 3/01/2006, you wrote:\n\n      I am sorry to have to report the death of Basil Robinson on December 29, he was 93. In the early 60s I took blades to the V&A museum to be vetted and he was always unfailingly polite about the most outrageous rubbish that I showed him, also I think most collectors of my age were started on the slippery slope of sword collecting by his &#39;Arts of the Japanese Sword&#39;.\n      Alan\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
