Being a 2-character signature it is next to impossible to pin the fellow down, particularly with the blade in its present condition which looks pretty rough. A quick guess based on the condition of the nakago (on the photo) would make me think the sword came from late ko-to period or early shin-to which would be from the last quarter of the 16th century up through perhaps the first quarter of the 17th century. I don&#39;t recall how many Norimune are listed in that time-span in Hawley&#39;s, but you can check that out. Quite possibly a Bizen smith.\n\nRon\nSTL\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: swcollector2001 \n  To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Wednesday, April 06, 2005 9:45 PM\n  Subject: [nihontostudy] Re: Need signature help.\n\n\n\n  So could this be the Norimune of the 12th century, or another Norimune?\n\n\n\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  Yahoo!
