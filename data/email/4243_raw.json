The\n&gt; &gt; heads of t=\r\nhe rivet were decorated and eventually became the \nmenuki we know\n&gt; &gt; today=\r\n.  What I did not know until these emails is that some \nmenuki have\n&gt; &gt; &quot;in=\r\nterlocking pins&quot; to become mekugi.  Sure, I&#39;ve seen these on \ncheap\n&gt; &gt; Mei=\r\nji\n&gt; &gt; pieces, especially tanto, but didn&#39;t know early Goto menuki had \nthe=\r\n same\n&gt; &gt; feature.  We can clearly see that as the Nihonto developed from \n=\r\nearliest\n&gt; &gt; times\n&gt; &gt; the disadvantage of a fixed rivet became evident, bu=\r\nt the early \nmenuki\n&gt; &gt; discussed\n&gt; &gt; appear to have still functioned as a =\r\nmekugi, only later becoming \nseparate\n&gt; &gt; with a\n&gt; &gt; bamboo mekugi, or meku=\r\ngi of other material (iron??).  I also \nremember that\n&gt; &gt; in\n&gt; &gt; the Momoya=\r\nma period a single menuki was used, accounting for some \nof the\n&gt; &gt; &quot;orphan=\r\ns&quot; we see.  Looking back over my collecting career I think \nI once\n&gt; &gt; had =\r\na\n&gt; &gt; single (i.e., never a pair) shakudo menuki of a pomegranate.  It \nwas=\r\n of\n&gt; &gt; that\n&gt; &gt; really dark black shakudo.  Sometimes knowledge comes too =\r\nlate to \nsave us\n&gt; &gt; from\n&gt; &gt; ourselves!!!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Ken, I do have somewhere=\r\n a late 19th century English treatise on \nthe Goto\n&gt; &gt; mainline (Shirobei 1=\r\n7 generations) with photos, but it doesn&#39;t go \ninto the\n&gt; &gt; &quot;secret marks&quot;.=\r\n..
