A year or so ago I wrote an article for the JSS/US to ill=\r\nustrate some menuki depicting the mythical &quot;baku.&quot; The one set of menuki we=\r\nre fairly large sized as one might expect in Ezo but the other set were wha=\r\nt I&#39;d call &quot;normal&quot; menuki size, but they also had all the other characteri=\r\nstics of Ezo. To me, it seemed somewhat unusual to find the &quot;baku&quot; creature=\r\n depicted on menuki thought to be Ezo. Earlier, I did show these to both Ji=\r\nm Gilbert and Bob Haynes and they agreed that they appeared to be Ezo works=\r\n. But really, I wonder who knows; Buttweiler&#39;s writings on Ezo are about al=\r\nl I&#39;ve ever really found regarding Ezo, at least what comes to mind tonight=\r\n. \n\nHere now is a nice Echizen Kanenori katana that was found in nice quali=\r\nty WWII gunto mounting. What&#39;s kind of unique is that the tsuka has menuki =\r\ndepicting a fairly large &quot;tiger&quot; which -- judging while held in place under=\r\n wrapping -- really does have the look of possibly being Ezo. The &quot;worn gol=\r\nd gilding&quot; is there, the size is right, but I wonder. I&#39;d love to remove th=\r\nese but find it difficult to bring myself to unwrap this tsuka in order to =\r\n&quot;get them into my hand.&quot; (The wrap is already broken, but remains almost al=\r\nl there and intact.) Now I would think it unusual, as with the &quot;baku,&quot; to f=\r\nind Ezo menuki depicting a running &quot;tiger.&quot; It is a temptation to have a lo=\r\nok at these, for sure! If these are no Ezo, I wonder where they should be p=\r\nlaced? \n\nRon\nSTL\n\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: Alan Bale \n  To: =\r\nStudy Group \n  Sent: Monday, December 11, 2006 6:25 AM\n  Subject: Re: [niho=\r\nntostudy] Aizu / Shoki Kinko Menuki\n\n\n  I don&#39;t think there is any real con=\r\nnection between Ezo and Ko-Mino menuki, Ezo menuki are generally larger and=\r\n with a less detailed design (large cherry blossom etc), I wonder if those =\r\nsmaller Ezo menuki with a detailed design are Ezo at all.\n\n  Alan\n\n  ----- =\r\nOriginal Message ----- \n  From: klepet33319 \n  To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups=\r\n.com \n  Sent: Sunday, December 10, 2006 5:23 PM\n  Subject: [nihontostudy] A=\r\nizu / Shoki Kinko Menuki\n\n  http://page10.auctions.yahoo.co.jp/jp/auction/m=\r\n35952378\n\n  Can anyone elaborate on where these fit in historically?
