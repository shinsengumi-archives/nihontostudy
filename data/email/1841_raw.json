Wakizashi, or uchikatana in the tachi wearing \ndays, would stick out where comfortable for warrior to access.  very \nmuch an individual thing.  do not look at late Edo period photos for \nanswer, either .  those last samurai had never known war.  The peace \nof the Togagawa Shogunate had the unfortunate effect of diluting the \nspirit of Bushido, and causing the diminished quality of swords made, \nas well as spawning scores of schools for teaching martial arts, as \nthe best teacher --- combat, war --- was reduced to duels, or \ncriminal behavior.  \n\nTechniques of forging were lost.  The past was mythologized, \nidealized.  The arts flowered, but the high ranking samurai stagnated.\nmany low ranking samurai, often for financial reasons, became \nmerchants, artisans, even farmers [returning to their roots, for some]\nMany of the traditions we assume were common since the Kamakura Era \nwere really just idealizations written down in late Shinto or \nShinShinto times [1700-1868] times as the moribund samurai of the Edo \nEra tried to keep the spirit of the 1st samurai, [though they were \nnot called that in 670 AD] the Emperor Temmu, alive.\n\ndoug e\n\n\n\n\n\nIn nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Mark Sala&quot; &lt;franzkafka19@m...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; No, I have not seen it yet.
