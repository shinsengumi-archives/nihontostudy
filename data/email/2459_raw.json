It was made to\nopen to the right instead of left. The owner said it\nwas made for a left handed samurai. He said before\nTokugawa era there were the standard amount of left\nhanded samurai as any population but that after Edo\nstarted they were forced to change.

There is some question as to whether\n&gt; or not they were for\n&gt; wear with the cutting edge down. I don&#39;t know of any\n&gt; illustrations showing\n&gt; right handed wear. I might add that to the best of\n&gt; my knowledge there is no\n&gt; such thing as an entirely left-handed person.\n&gt; Left-handed individuals either\n&gt; due to nurture or nature seem to do some things with\n&gt; the right-hand and\n&gt; others with the left and sometimes able to use both\n&gt; for the same thing.\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Gordon\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: John Lissenden\n&gt; [mailto:docliss@...] \n&gt; Sent: Tuesday, December 21, 2004 12:10 AM\n&gt; To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: Re: [nihontostudy] Musashi&#39;s sword\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; To inject a slightly more serious note into the\n&gt; smugness of your &#39;leftie&#39;\n&gt; members ... \n&gt; \n&gt; Do any members KNOW if left-handedness was extant\n&gt; among early Japanese\n&gt; swordsmen.  I have never, personally, seen\n&gt; illustrations of samurai wearing\n&gt; their swords on the right side, and it is not\n&gt; inconceivable that they were\n&gt; trained at an early age to use their swords in the\n&gt; conventional manner.  The\n&gt; only advantage in being left handed is, surely, its\n&gt; comparative rarity and\n&gt; strangeness to a right-handed opponent.\n&gt; \n&gt; Interestingly, I have in my collection (WAY\n&gt; 386.27.ex Gardiner collection)\n&gt; an unsigned,  shakudo fuchi-gashira, attributed to\n&gt; Hirata Harunari  This has\n&gt; an ishime surface, with takaramono in a shippo of\n&gt; coloured enamels within\n&gt; gold cloissons.  The ura surface of the fuchi has\n&gt; had an additional\n&gt; takaramono added in gold lacquer, and this may\n&gt; possibly be to facilitate its\n&gt; wearing on the right side by presenting a more\n&gt; decorative surface.  I can\n&gt; think of no other possible explanation for this\n&gt; modification.\n&gt; \n&gt; John L.\n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been\n&gt; removed]\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo!
