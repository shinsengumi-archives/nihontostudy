This work is \nlittle better than shiiremono.  The style of =\r\nthis period was a \ncombination of Shoami and later Umetada school styles. .=\r\n..  The poor \nquality of Aizu Shoami tsuba is partially due to the fact tha=\r\nt for \ntwo hundred and twenty six years the Kato family governed this \nprov=\r\nince without giving their patronage to the Shoami artists who \nlived there.=\r\n  They made no effort to raise the level of the work \nproduced, or take an =\r\ninterest in its production. The workers of the \nprovince were forced, as in=\r\ndependent artists, to fend for themselves, \nseeking work anywhere it might =\r\nbe available.  ...  At the end of the \nEdo age there were two wholesale dea=\r\nlers of &#39;saikumono&#39; (metal \nhandiwork) living at Wakamatsu in Aizu.  They e=\r\nmployed many workers \nto fill the orders for the mass productions of the Ai=\r\nzu Shoami \nschool. ... In Meiji/Taisho they produced all types of copies an=\r\nd \nimitations for the Tokyo and foreign market.  In addition to the Aizu \ns=\r\ntyle they made Heianjo brass inlay and Heianjo openwork, as well as \nNobuiy=\r\ne, Kaneiye, shingen and famous late kinko artist forgeries and \nimitations.=\r\n  In fact, they made any and all styles that had a ready \nmarket with the f=\r\noreigners of Europe and America.  This was the final \nfate of the Aizu Shoa=\r\nmi school&quot;.\n\nPersonally I wouldn&#39;t draw a comparison with Bungo as they wer=\r\ne a \nvery legitimate area of sword production and these became outright \nfo=\r\nrgeries and reproductions of poor quality in later Edo.  \n\n--- In nihontost=\r\nudy@yahoogroups.com, &quot;bungotakadasword&quot; \n&lt;MuramasaIII@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; -t,\n&gt;=\r\n the Ko-kinko tsuba is in the Lundgren collection book and a scan is \n&gt; ava=\r\nilable in my photo album on the list, Pete the dentist has a \nbetter \n&gt; sca=\r\nn...........\n&gt; \n&gt; got another question ..........\n&gt; Is the Aizu Shoami scho=\r\nol of soft metal tsuba the &quot; Bungo sword &quot; \nof \n&gt; the tsuba world ?....like=\r\n if one is not sure what it is then \nchances \n&gt; are it&#39;s an Aizu  &quot; Shoamim=\r\nono &quot; ??\n&gt; \n&gt; Milt\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n"
