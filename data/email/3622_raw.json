Meetings start just after noon, hope you will join us.  \nFeel free to email me off list with questions...\n-t\nOn Dec 22, 2005, at 9:16 PM, Anthony H wrote:\n\n&gt; Tom,\n&gt;   I did a google search for &quot;SF Sword Group&quot; and found two groups.  \n&gt; I thought I recognized your name on the NCJSC website in the highly  \n&gt; powered and illustrious position of board member. I take it the  \n&gt; next meeting is January 8th. What time does the meeting start? The  \n&gt; NCJSC site doesn&#39;t say.\n&gt;\n&gt;   Do you know anything about the other group called SF Japanese  \n&gt; Sword Society?\n&gt;\n&gt;   Anthony\n&gt;\n&gt; Tom Helm &lt;junkmail@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;   Beautiful Ken!\n&gt;       Truth is often found in jest!
