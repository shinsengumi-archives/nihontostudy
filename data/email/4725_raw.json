The obverse (red background) is convex whilst the reverse (green background) is flat.  A polisher visiting once commented &quot;a good one!!&quot;.  Early Edo period ca 1670, I believe.\n\nOh, it&#39;s in my folder &quot;Barry Thomas&quot; third one on the first page (sorry, no tiny url.  Something else I have to learn how to do!).  John I think I sent you these images quite some while ago???\n\nBest regards,\n\nBarry Thomas.\n\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: Ron Hartmann \n  To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Thursday, December 07, 2006 7:46 AM\n  Subject: Re: [nihontostudy] Re: Tsuba help\n\n\n  Dear John, others - \n\n  I&#39;ve posted a photo of the interesting namban tsuba that John had referred to earlier. The motif consists of dragons and catfish, a shrine (with gold jewel peak), breaking waves and vines (?) in sukashi work. This large tsuba (84mm rnd. x 4mm thick) has Tokubetsu Hozon certificate. The poster is in Yahoo photos: http://tinyurl.com/yxt45h\n  in a file named: Ron STL Perhaps John wishes to elaborate on this tsuba a bit more? \n\n  John, I&#39;ve just received my copy of your book, &quot;The Namban Group of Japanese Sword Guards; Aa Reappraisal&quot; and I&#39;m looking forward to digesting your research findings which make up this publication. Interesting!\n\n  Ron\n  STL\n  .,_._,___ \n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
