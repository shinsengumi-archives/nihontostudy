They are\nbriskly sold if rationally priced.\n\nI have been collecting them for 25 years.\nI probably have 15-20 at this time.\n\nI sold the piece you referred to that is in the\nKremers book about 15 years ago to a European collector\nthat was subsequently offered by A. Quirt.\n\nYou were smart not to buy it.\nThe reason I sold it ($1,200) was because\nit papered as Yagyu kodai (later generation).\nI sold it as such.\n\nThat fact seems to have been missing from the\ndescription in the Kremers book.\n\nP.S. To date no Yagyu tsuba have been\ndesignated as Juyo Tosogu.\n\nCary Condell\n\nCondell & Co., Ltd.\nP.O.

I jumped on it, and\n&gt; got an email back confirming I had it. The next day I got an apologetic\n&gt; email saying that when he went to the shop he found it had been sold to a\n&gt; walk-in customer. So it goes.\n&gt; \n&gt; A few years ago Andy Quirt had one that is in the Kremmers book, and I had\n&gt; him send it to me on approval. In addition to the nosebleed price, it just\n&gt; did not grab me, and I sent it back. Bob Haynes later shared with me the\n&gt; fact that had Kremmers over cleaned all his guards, and that&#39;s what had\n&gt; turned me off without knowing at the time that was the cause.\n&gt; \n&gt; I suspect that Yagyu guards - maybe most really great guards - change hands\n&gt; either at the big auction houses or privately.\n&gt; \n&gt; Craig\n&gt; \n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: Richard Turner [mailto:ikkanshi@...] \n&gt; Sent: Wednesday, January 14, 2004 7:01 PM\n&gt; To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: [nihontostudy] Yagyu guards\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; All, in my few modest years of collecting, I can&#39;t ever remember seeing any\n&gt; Yagyu school tsuba for sale. I was thinking about this this morning, Are\n&gt; they quite rare ?, They appear in enough books and I really like there\n&gt; simplistic design. I cannot remember ever seeing them on any of the\n&gt; commercial sites, both Western and Japanese, I don&#39;t really expect to see\n&gt; any on Ebay or Bidders.com.\n&gt; \n&gt; are they that rarely available or have I just missed seeing them.\n&gt; \n&gt; cheers\n&gt; \n&gt; Rich\n&gt; \n\n-- \n\n\n\n\n"
