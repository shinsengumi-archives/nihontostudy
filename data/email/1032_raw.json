Early Akasaka guards will usually have a very full, round maru mimi.  Owari guards tend to be rather squarish (but there are exceptions).  Some guards that otherwise resemble Owari get put into Ko-Shoami if the rim is more rounded.  But these have no where near the rounding of early Akasaka work.\n\n  I&#39;ll get to something on Ezo and Ainu work in the next couple of days.\n\n  The lunar eclipse is underway here in the Eastern US.\n\n  Jim\n\n\n\n    Hi Jim, yes that&#39;s them, that&#39;s what I thought as well, I thought they were mostly pretty chunky like the Owari guards.\n\n    Rich\n\n    p.s.  strange about these links of mine, I must have been studying at the &quot;Milt school of URL linking&quot; :-)\n\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n        Yahoo!
