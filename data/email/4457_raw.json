I recommended Shinsa because \novera=\r\nll the sword was in good condition.  The Boshi was a gamble but \nworth tryi=\r\nng.  I did tell you before the Shinsa all of this didn&#39;t I?\n\nMoses Becerra\n=\r\n\n\n\n\n--- In nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com, &quot;elliottshogun&quot; &lt;elliott@...&gt; \nwro=\r\nte:\n&gt;\n&gt; I did not know that a Boshi running off the tip was considered a \n&gt;=\r\n fatal flaw. Thats why I joined this group. To learn. And of course, \n&gt; pol=\r\nishing the blade would not make the Boshi come back. Actually, \n&gt; this blad=\r\ne did not need a polish, everything was in place (except \n&gt; for the missing=\r\n temper line). I am surprized that Moses didn&#39;t \npoint \n&gt; this out to me an=\r\nd recommend possibly not submitting it for Shinsa. \n&gt; Again, this is all pa=\r\nrt of learning.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thank you both (Paul & Rich) for furthering my educati=\r\non.\n&gt; \n&gt; Elliott \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com, =\r\npaul bowman &lt;bowman1955@&gt; \n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; just to balance the comment mad=\r\ne earlier, yes I agree with Rich, \n&gt; if the hamon runs off the sword would =\r\nnot paper unless it was an \n&gt; historically important smith or blade. I have=\r\n seen 1 Juyo where \n&gt; there is apparently no boshi. cant remember who by bu=\r\nt it was very \n&gt; early and by a top smith. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Richard Turner &lt;ikkans=\r\nhi@&gt; wrote:          Just a curiosity, \n&gt; does the temper run off the kissa=\r\nki, if so, is this \n&gt; &gt; not a fatal flaw and not being an historically impo=\r\nrtant piece, \n&gt; would \n&gt; &gt; not paper with any group.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Cheers\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; Rich\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; elliottshogun wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I agree with Paul, the NT=\r\nHK should say something about the piece\n&gt; &gt; &gt; they are about to &#39;pink slip&#39;=\r\n.

Shinto Bizen used Bizen Osafun=\r\ne Ju -. \n&gt; Anyway, I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; was disappointed that the only explanation given=\r\n was that they \n&gt; would\n&gt; &gt; &gt; not Shinsa it due to the &#39;temper line&#39; runnin=\r\ng off in the \n&gt; kissaki.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Oh well, I will bring it to next years SF To=\r\nken Kai and get all\n&gt; &gt; &gt; sorts of opinions.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Elliott\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; --- In nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;mailto:nihontostudy%40yahoogr=\r\noups.com&gt;, paul bowman \n&gt; &lt;bowman1955@&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dont a=\r\ngree Rich, If a novice (or indeed anyone else) submits\n&gt; &gt; &gt; something they=\r\n have no clue about I think it would be useful at\n&gt; &gt; &gt; least to be told wh=\r\nat the tsuba/ sword etc was trying to be. \n&gt; using a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; catch-all Bungo-=\r\nTakada, echizen seki, or shiomi attribution does\n&gt; &gt; &gt; little to advance th=\r\neir knowledge.
