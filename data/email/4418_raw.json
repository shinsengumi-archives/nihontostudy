I guess thoughts of gimei spring \nto mind. I am curious as to the worth of some of these guards, I have a \nlink to a tsuba by Suishinshi Masahide that is considered I think quite \nimportant. I have linked a scan of the information here\n\nhttp://www.nihontokanjipages.com//personal/Masahide-tsuba.jpg\n\nI find these guard quite interesting and wonder if for example, Masahide \nand his students, being the traditionalists that they were and working \nin the old Koto ways, liked to do the full bit, as in make tsuba for \nsome of their swords as well ?? just like the old Tosho did.\n\nJust speculating.\n\nCheers\n\nRich\n\n\n\nAlan Bale wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Rich,\n&gt; I think tosho signed with much the same signature they used on blades \n&gt; although as the kanji are very small the cutting might be different.\n&gt;\n&gt; If you are thinking about fake tosho signatures on tsuba, I have never \n&gt; heard of this happening although we did have a Shinkai tsuba in \n&gt; Christie&#39;s last sale which was not believed.\n&gt;\n&gt; There is not a lot in the books as the tsuba are not considered as \n&gt; being of much importance.\n&gt;\n&gt; Alan\n&gt;\n&gt; ----- Original Message -----\n&gt; From: Richard Turner\n&gt; To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com &lt;mailto:nihontostudy%40yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Friday, August 25, 2006 7:44 AM\n&gt; Subject: [nihontostudy] Edo period Tosho tsuba\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi all, it is a bit quiet here so I thought I might run this past\n&gt; people. Did swordsmiths, that made tsuba, sign any differently compared\n&gt; to their sword mei ?. Did that have different designations ?, or use\n&gt; alternate titles ?, and are there any records, i.e. references or books\n&gt; showing Tosho tsuba mei ?.\n&gt;\n&gt; I have seen various mei on tsuba by Masahide, Naotsuna, Naokatasu and\n&gt; they are close, though the papered Naokatsu I have seen show some\n&gt; differences. I have also recently come into possession of tsuba signed\n&gt; Yasutsugu and Daido. I am looking at buying a Naokatsu tsuba when I am\n&gt; in Japan next month.\n&gt;\n&gt; Some of the greatest mid/late Edo sword smiths had a hand at making\n&gt; tsuba and it appears that they, for the most part, did an excellent job.\n&gt; I would be interested in any material, references and articles on this\n&gt; subject. I have Roberts Haynes&#39; information in the Tsuba, an Aesthetic\n&gt; guide and Nihonto Koza but would also like to read anything else that\n&gt; might be about the place.\n&gt;\n&gt; Cheers\n&gt;\n&gt; Richard Turner\n&gt;\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
