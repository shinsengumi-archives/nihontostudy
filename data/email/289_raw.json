Then in Robinson&#39;s The Arts of the\nJapanese Sword, he places the emphasis of importance starting at Kami,\nthen Suku and Daijo^ are next followed up with Jo^.\n\nIs there a rule for this, are they all as important as each other at the\nend of the day, which is correct if either and if not, the what ?.\n\ncheers in advance.\n\nRich T\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
