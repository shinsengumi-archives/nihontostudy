From the colour of the metal I am guessing at a 16th \n&gt; century date although John Harding gave a Heian date to one in a \n&gt; catalogue he compiled! (One of the Sarzi-Amade selling catalogues).\n&gt;\n&gt; I think it possible that the maker was not a professional tsuba-ko as \n&gt; there is no reason to use such a complex construction method, the \n&gt; maker also does not seem to have a sense of the seppa-dai as a \n&gt; discrete area in itself, hence the curious decoration there that \n&gt; amazingly was applied before the nakago-ana was cut through.\n&gt;\n&gt; Perhaps the makers of these tsuba were artisans who used this thin \n&gt; sheet yamagane for other purposes and saw a gap in the tsuba market. \n&gt; Does anyone know of other uses for this type of thin plate and \n&gt; decoration?\n&gt;\n&gt; I have seen these illustrated in japanese books, the only one that \n&gt; comes immediately to mind is in Nihon Toban Zusetsu by Takezawa, \n&gt; probably by the same maker as mine, as the same defective spiral punch \n&gt; was used for both tsuba, Takezawa called it &#39;ko-kinko&#39; Any thoughts on \n&gt; this will be gratefully received.\n&gt;\n&gt; Alan\n&gt;\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n&gt; \n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
