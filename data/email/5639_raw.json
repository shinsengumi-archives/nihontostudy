My uncle is now =\r\ngone, but I have come into possession of that tanto.  However, I don&#39;t know=\r\n anything about it, although I&#39;m trying to find someone to whom I could tak=\r\ne it who would know how to identify/analyze it (no luck yet).\n\nI wonder if =\r\nany of you could take the time to look at the pictures I have of it and tel=\r\nl me what you can about it?  I&#39;d appreciate any info/ideas about how old it=\r\n is, what &quot;school&quot; it might be from (if any), or anything else.\n\nHere&#39;s the=\r\n link to my flickr account:\n\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/73941163@N00/?sav=\r\ned=3D1\n\nI&#39;d appreciate any thoughts.
