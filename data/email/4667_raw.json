The scaly-dry appearance of the stee=\r\nl \nis an indication that it might have been. Fires were a problem \nthrougho=\r\nut Japan&#39;s history that affected many swords. There are \narticles written t=\r\nhat describe to some degree what characteristics to \nlook for. \nIn general,=\r\n this is one lesson many beginners unfortunately \nexperience at one time or=\r\n another. \n\nregards,\nFranco\n\n\n\n--- In nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com, &quot;dwmac2=\r\n000&quot; &lt;dwmac2000@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Hello Again,\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ve managed to post =\r\na few photos in my album titled &quot; Interesting \n&gt; Sword.&quot;  The pictures are =\r\nmediocre at best, but will hopefully show \n&gt; some of its charactoristics.  =\r\nThe grain lines in the hada 2 photo \n&gt; actually shine brightly as opposed t=\r\no what is seen in the picture.\n&gt; There is a bit of the hamon which can be s=\r\neen in the upper section \n&gt; of the hamon 1 photo.  The sword is in obvious =\r\nneed of polish.  It \n&gt; laid on the battlefield at Okinawa during WWll for s=\r\neveral days \n&gt; before being discovered by a young Marine.  It was stored aw=\r\nay with \n&gt; little or no attention since.  Oddly, the sword seemed to have \n=\r\nfound \n&gt; me as opposed to the other way around.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m trying to research=\r\n the sword and have a little knowledge from \n&gt; research I did on swords my =\r\nFather brought home from WWll as a 11th \n&gt; Airborne Paratrooper.  I didn&#39;t =\r\nrealize what I was getting into!\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ve had some much appreciated input =\r\nfrom Ron and Ricky.  I still \n&gt; think judging from the Nakago condition the=\r\n sword is most likely a \n&gt; Bakumatsu era Ko-to copy.  If anyone should happ=\r\nen to have opinion \n&gt; as to time period or otherwise based on the photos it=\r\n would be \nagain \n&gt; greatly appreciated!\n&gt; \n&gt; Dave\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n"
