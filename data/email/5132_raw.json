Howe=\r\nver, with all of the repros being \nproduced I want to be as sure as I can b=\r\nefore any purchase.\nMy concern with this particular sword is the excessive =\r\namount of text \nseen on the nakago. I have never seen a published example w=\r\nith so much\nwriting. It almost appears overdone on purpose so as to make th=\r\ne \npiece look authentic.\nWould appreciate the group&#39;s opinion on this and a=\r\nny other aspects of \nthe sword that may look suspicious to you.\nhttp://tiny=\r\nurl.com/yok5wk\nhttp://tinyurl.com/22ek8o\nhttp://tinyurl.com/29vkog\nhttp://t=\r\ninyurl.com/2bx95b\nhttp://tinyurl.com/26qmfv\n\nThese should post as clickable=\r\n links, but if not I&#39;ll be glad to \nupload them to the photo section.\n\nThan=\r\nks,\n\nKeith Simmons\n\n\n\n"
