There are 239 tsuba lots with a mix similar to what is in the other catalogs.  There are 40 lots of kodogu and some books, armor, etc.  There are about 68 lots of swords, including the Kokuho Iesuke, a Juyo Hasebe katana, a blade with Juyo tachi koshirae formerly owned by the Duke of Windsor, a daisho with gold mounted koshirae and another fancy daisho formerly owned by Admiral Nomura.  There&#39;s even a tanto by Francis Boyd.\n\n  Number 5 has more of Tsuba Geijutsu-ko including Haruta, Suruga, Kamakura bori and the various brass inlay types.  There are 248 lots of tsuba, again the usual mix.  Also 150 or so kodogu lots plus some books, armor and miscellaneous stuff.  There are inro, netsuke, ogime,etc., and 57 lots of prints.  A little bit of everything.  I vaguely recall something about many of the copies of number 5 being damaged in storage, but it may just be that fewer were printed.     \n\n  Alan Harvie has been selling new copies of the catalogs for years for a very low price, but he has run out of numbers 1, 5 and 10.\n  Jim\n\n\n\n    Can anyone tell me what&#39;s in vols. 1 & 5 of the Haynes catalogues, and why\n    it is the 5 is the least common?\n\n\n\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n        Yahoo!
