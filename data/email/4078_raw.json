Whil=\r\ne reading up on Yagyu tsuba in \n&gt; &gt; the &#39;Selected Fine Japanese Swords from=\r\n European NBTHK \nCollections&#39; \n&gt; I \n&gt; &gt; ran across an interesting reference=\r\n to Yagyu Yoshikane Renya \n(1625-\n&gt; &gt; 94) who is the founder of the Yagyu s=\r\ntyle of sword guards.  \n&gt; &gt; Apparently after retiring from being the fourth=\r\n master of the \n&gt; school \n&gt; &gt; he set about the design of tsuba, having them=\r\n crafted by many \n&gt; leading \n&gt; &gt; Owari tsubako of the day.  His workshop wa=\r\ns located in the \nvillage \n&gt; of \n&gt; &gt; Kobayashi, south of Nagoya Castle, and=\r\n he took the priest name of \n&gt; &gt; Kobayashi Osho.

Saavik asks for suggestion=\r\ns, to which \n&gt; Kirk \n&gt; &gt; replies that she should pray as the Klingons don&#39;t=\r\n take \nprisoners. \n&gt; &gt; All the &quot;deceased&quot; officers begin to rise, the blowe=\r\nrs begin \n&gt; blowing \n&gt; &gt; the smoke in the simulator room clear, and the tra=\r\ninees are \nordered \n&gt; &gt; to report for debriefing. Saavik remains and protes=\r\nts that the \ntest \n&gt; &gt; was unfair as there was no way to win.
