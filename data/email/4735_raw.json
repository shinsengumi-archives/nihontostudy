It has been said to be the \nem=\r\nbodiment of the Samurai&#39;s code, the expression of his steel \ndiscipline, un=\r\nswerving devotion, and peerless skill.  It is, in \naddition, one of the mos=\r\nt outstanding examples of Japan&#39;s traditon of \nhighly skilled craftsmanship=\r\n.  The tireless efforts of hereditary \nartisans, who&#39;s sole efforts in life=\r\n was the achievement of perfection \nin their craft, the Samurai sword is in=\r\ndeed a beautiful work of art as \nwell as a formidable weapon.&quot;\n\nYour Shin-t=\r\no sword may very well be as much as 400 yrs. old.  It has \nremained just as=\r\n the Swordsmith intended it to be through &quot;Many&quot; \nowners.  All of whom did =\r\nnot feel the need to alter it.  Yes, you are \nthe present owner, to do with=\r\n it as you wish.  However, &quot;All&quot; of us \nare only temporary &quot;Custodian&#39;s&quot; of=\r\n these artifacts.  I would \nencourage you leave it &quot;as is.&quot;  Allow the many=\r\n future owners to study \nand enjoy it in original unalterd form. \n\nI myself=\r\n am even reluctant to have a sword polished which could be \nconsidered &quot;sor=\r\nely in need.&quot;  The two deflected blade marks in the \nmune would be gone.  T=\r\nhe two &quot;knicks&quot; in the ha which may have been \nretaliatory strokes would al=\r\nso be gone.....\n\nGood luck,\n\nDave\n\n\n\n- In nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com, &quot;eg=\r\nardonio&quot; &lt;egardon@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hello everybody, I&#39;m new to this forum so=\r\n if I make an error please\n&gt; remember that.
