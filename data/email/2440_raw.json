I hope this post is\nappropriate.\n\nI have a sword that was given to me by my father.  I believe he\nacquired it in the mid 1960s from someone who brought it back from\nWWII.  I know I remember him having it before 1968.  As far as I can\ntell from my research on the &#39;net, it is a &#39;kyu gunto.&#39;\n\nI&#39;m trying to find the value of this sword.  I know that an appraisal\ncannot be done via the &#39;net, but I&#39;m hoping someone could give me\nestimated upper and lower limits, so I can decide if it is even worth\npursuing an official appraisal.\n\nThe only local (northern Georgia, USA) help I have found is a referral\nto someone who has a booth at the local gun shows, who supposedly buys\nand sells Japanese militaria.  Eastman is having a gun show in Atlanta\nthis weekend and in Gainesville next weekend, and I&#39;m trying to decide\nwhether it is worth driving there and paying to get in the show, for\nthe possiblity of getting an appraisal.\n\nIf you feel inclined to take a look at some photos and give me clue\nwhether I have something of value or just a piece of junk, I would\nappreciate it.  To that end I have posted some photos on my website at\nhttp://www.hillfamily.org/david/sword/.\n\nthanks,\nDavid Hill\nSautee-Nacoochee, GA, USA\n\n\n\n\n"
