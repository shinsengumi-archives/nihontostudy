However, he tends not to elaborate \non this, and si=\r\nnce the images are virtually entirely in black and \nwhite in the two well-k=\r\nnown English language texts on sukashi tsuba, \nit is difficult to actually =\r\nsee what he means when he makes such \ncomments.  A few times he does note t=\r\nhat Momoyama Kanayama tsuba tend \nto have a reddish cast to them (as well a=\r\ns being smaller) when \ncompared to Kanayama guards of earlier times.  I was=\r\n just wondering if \nthis is the consensus among those of you who have much =\r\nexperience with \nKanayama tsuba.  If so, is it enough to conclude that such=\r\n \ncharacteristics are so consistent as to be understood as definitive of \nt=\r\nhe period?\n\nSteven\n\n\n\n\n"
