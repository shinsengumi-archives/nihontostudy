I believe as Jim mentioned that the \nbarbs on the &quot;quadraspike&quot; (how&#39;s that for a word!) are for breaking \nthe blade of an opponent.  I also think that the tightly woven fiber \nbands on both sides of it would act as shock absorbers..they would \nflex under impact and then spring back to their original position.  I \nimagine the impact of a blade against another weapon would be \nconsiderable.  I think also that with this heavy a blade, the pole \nwould need quite a bit of reinforcement and all these fittings would \ndefinately supply that.  I believe the section behind the large tsuba \nwould have had same&#39; panels and tsukamaki wrap for the left (forward) \nhand.  This nagamaki is very plain in all respects and in my opinion \nis probably a Shinshinto copy of an older fighting piece not some \nlate ceremonial decoration.  The Shinshinto period was a time \nof &quot;experimental archaeology&quot; in that the Japanese were trying to \nrediscover their earlier sword making styles and abilities and I \nthink this may be one outcome of that study.\nKeith  \n\n\n"
