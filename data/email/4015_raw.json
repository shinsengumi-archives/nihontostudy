Nice to have that kind of provenance, gives it \nthat litt=\r\nle bit extra. John\n\n\n\n--- In nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Jim Gilbert&quot; &lt;j=\r\nggilbert@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I have added scans of the other side of the tsuba=\r\n to the folder \nbelow.  I forgot to mention the dimensions again, so for th=\r\ne record \nthey are 90.1 mm H x 84.1 mm W x 5.0 - 5.5 mm thick at the mimi.\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; The maker is Nobuie and the signature is of the type now called \nfutoj=\r\ni-mei =E5=A4=AA=E5=AD=97=E9=8A=98 (bold, thick).  Within both the hanare an=\r\nd \nfutoji-mei types there is considerable variation in the detail of \nthe s=\r\nignatures.  This example is not one of the more boldly executed \nfutoji-mei=\r\n.  As Pete crypictically indicated, an oshigata of this \nguard is published=\r\n in Nakamura Kakudayu and Akiyama Kyusaku&#39;s 1926 \nNobuie Tsuba shu (#52).  =\r\nThere the signature is described as sumari-\nmei =E8=A9=B0=E3=82=8A=E9=8A=98=\r\n (&quot;close packed&quot;), which is one of the older terms now \nincluded within the=\r\n futoji-mei type.  This guard is described as \nfutoji-mei in several later =\r\nbooks and in the NBTHK&#39;s attribution.\n&gt; \n&gt; The hitsuana had not yet been fi=\r\nlled when the oshigata was made.  \nThis guard was the property of the Okubo=\r\n daimyo family in Odawara \nuntil it was sold in 1931, so the ana were likel=\r\ny filled by the new \nowner.  It is unlikely that they are original to the p=\r\nlate given \nthat they are made such that the guard would be mounted with th=\r\ne \nunsigned side as the front.  The shapes of the hitsuana are \nunusual.   =\r\nIt was clearly mounted with an o-kozuka, which are \ntypically 18-20 mm wide=\r\n (vs. the standard size of 14-15 mm).  As \nGordon mentioned, the small size=\r\n of the kogai-ana suggests it was \nmounted with one of the narrow style ko-=\r\nMino kogai.  The opening is \ntoo small to accommodate a standard 14-15 mm w=\r\nide kogai.\n&gt; \n&gt; The early Edo period &quot;betsujin&quot; (different person) Nobuie w=\r\nork \nwill lack the quality in the metal, tekkotsu, finish and carving.  \nTh=\r\ne plates are usually rather characterless and the working lacks \nsubtlety. =\r\n The late Edo period revival pieces do indeed try to \nemulate the finish of=\r\n the originals and as Alan mentioned some do a \nfairly good job.  In genera=\r\nl, the working of the rim is a bit forced \nand overdone in these examples c=\r\nompared to the originals.  They \nobviously will look young, but there is al=\r\nso a somewhat artificial \nquality to them.  The same feeling comes from lat=\r\ner copies of early \nShino and Oribe ceramics.\n&gt; \n&gt; The metal, tekkotsu and =\r\nyakite finish should lead to an Owari \norigin.  Remember that Kaneie worked=\r\n in Kyoto, and everything about \nhis guards is in line with Kyoto methods a=\r\nnd aesthetics.\n&gt; \n&gt; That&#39;s all I can think of at the moment.\n&gt; \n&gt; Jim  \n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   The photos for kantei problem number three can be viewed here:\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt;   http://ph.groups.yahoo.com/group/nihontostudy/photos/browse/3108\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\n  Jim\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n"
