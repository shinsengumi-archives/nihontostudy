He is certainly entirely correct about the Japanese sword hobby being dominated by a dealer&#39;s mentality.  I personally am involved in a number of areas of avocational collecting, and I never seen another area of interest where so large a percentage of collectors are also dealers.  An implicit paradigm of &quot;find a sword, polish the sword, paper the sword, sell the sword to a Japanese buyer&quot; lurks as a hidden goal assumption throughout the hobby.  \n\nI often marvel myself about the consequent universal American acceptance of Japanese preferences and tastes, for example the preference for owning a little-used ubu Koto sword over a well-worn suriage sword with a nakago full of holes testifying to considerable active use.  The former may have simply sat in a temple for centuries, while the latter perhaps actively participated in some of the great events of Japanese history.  \n\n----- Original Message ----- \n  From: Ron Hartmann \n  To: TOKEN ; nihonto@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Wednesday, May 07, 2003 2:49 PM\n  Subject: Fw: Haynes article...oops\n\n\n  Sorry, hit the &quot;send&quot; key by accident...\n\n  I found it interesting to read Bob&#39;s comments regarding the intended goal of the JSS/US when it was formed back in the late &#39;50s and also how today&#39;s world of collecting outside of Japan takes on primarily a &quot;buy and sell&quot; atmospher, that nobody puts on an exhibit purely for study as was done a few times in the past.  \n\n  Not going anywhere with this other than to say I found the article very interesting and though provoking.  Food for thought?  \n\n  Ron\n  STL\n\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: Ron Hartmann \n  To: nihonto@yahoogroups.com ; TOKEN \n  Sent: Wednesday, May 07, 2003 4:45 PM\n  Subject: Haynes article\n\n\n  Hi all -\n\n  With the arrival of the latest NCJSC newsletter, To-Ron, the first thing that caught my eye was an article written by Bob Haynes titled &quot;The Conscience of the Collector.&quot; At first I was not sure where Bob was going with his article but reading it, I found it quite &quot;thought provoking and wondered if others also found it so.\n\n  Basically, if I understand it correctly, the article points up the need for more serious kodogu study outside of Japan and the importance of thinking &quot;outside the box&quot;--traditional &quot;Japanese thinking&quot;--when it comes to sword study. \n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
