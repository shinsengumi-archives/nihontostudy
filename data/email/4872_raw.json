Interesting\ntopic. I think they are more remarkable for their iron\nthan their design.\n   I have yet to find any papered to Tochibata in the\npast 20 years. The advocates of it as a seperate\nschool seem to have died out.\n\nCurran\n\n\n\n--- bbmich3003 &lt;brucemichener@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; Hi Curran et al:\n&gt; I have a Tochibata tsuba that I bought from a\n&gt; well-known Japanese \n&gt; dealer. It is not papered, but, he wrote this info\n&gt; on the bill of \n&gt; sale: &quot; The old village of Tochihata eventually\n&gt; became Izumo in \n&gt; Shimane Prefecture;  during early Edo, the tsubako\n&gt; of this village \n&gt; specialized in making tsuba with the ji as carved\n&gt; rope, hence the \n&gt; name Tochihata for this type of tsuba&quot; [mine is a\n&gt; roped mimi].\n&gt; From this statement from him, I conjecture that a\n&gt; &#39;roped&#39; mimi tsuba \n&gt; called &#39;Tochibata&#39; does&#39;t refer to a mei of\n&gt; &quot;Tochibata&quot;, but to \n&gt; having been made on the island of Tochibata. It is\n&gt; possible that \n&gt; there are no tsuba with a mei &quot;Tochibata&quot;.  I\n&gt; welcome all corrections \n&gt; to the above. \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com, Curran Campbell\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;neobliviscar@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; List,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I am hoping a lurker out there might be able to\n&gt; &gt; comment on Tochibata tsuba. I am familiar with\n&gt; them as\n&gt; &gt; written up on page 58-59 of Harry Watson&#39;s Nihonto\n&gt; &gt; Koza translation of Kodogu Part 1.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve seen a limited number of these over the\n&gt; years,\n&gt; &gt; and they are distinct enough to me that I feel\n&gt; they\n&gt; &gt; constitute a distinct _if minor_ school.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Q1:  Has anyone ever seen a tsuba NBTHK / NTHK\n&gt; papered\n&gt; &gt; to Tochibata?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Q2:  Can anyone point me to further writing on\n&gt; this\n&gt; &gt; school?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; They tend to be strong solid open tsuba that\n&gt; remind of\n&gt; &gt; Owari, are thick, yet very clean. The last I saw\n&gt; was\n&gt; &gt; identical to the one on the bottom of NihontoKoza\n&gt; pg.\n&gt; &gt; 59 and sold as &quot;Owari&quot;.  I suspect the papering\n&gt; &gt; authorities just designate them &quot;Owari&quot;, but hope\n&gt; to\n&gt; &gt; find an either one papered Tochibata or hope to\n&gt; find\n&gt; &gt; another source beyond the Nihonto Koza.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Thanks in advance,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Curran\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt;\n______________________________________________________________________\n&gt; ______________\n&gt; &gt; Do you Yahoo!?\n&gt; &gt; Everyone is raving about the all-new Yahoo!
