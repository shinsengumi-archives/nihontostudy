Note the circular impression above the &quot;hole&quot; where it was possibly mounted.  I heard somewhere years ago that in Paris many tsuba were used in this way, complete with nail holes where they were fixed to doors.  A mate of mine has a beautiful shibuichi wakizashi tsuba with a similar, but smaller hole.  It was fitted to an umbrella...\n\nRegards,\n\nBatman Dude.\n\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: Kenneth Wilson \n  To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Wednesday, June 07, 2006 2:53 PM\n  Subject: Re: [nihontostudy] Mino Tsuba\n\n\n\n  must allow popups- try this\n  http://s25.photobucket.com/albums/c52/kamakiri/Mino/\n  Thanks\n  Ken aka &quot;the mantis dude&quot;\n\n  --- Kenneth Wilson &lt;kdw21620@...&gt; wrote:\n\n  &gt; Hi all,\n  &gt; \n  &gt; Picked this up from Germany. It is a beautiful Mino\n  &gt; Shakudo Tsuba. I believe the kogai ana is filled\n  &gt; with\n  &gt; copper. It has nice nanako. The edge is completely\n  &gt; filled with leaves and flowers,etc. The only really\n  &gt; weird thing is that the seppa-dai must have be put\n  &gt; on\n  &gt; a pole weapon or something. It has notches put in\n  &gt; and\n  &gt; the nakaga ana has been widened. Questions, where\n  &gt; would you classify this? I was thinking mid-edo, \n  &gt; but\n  &gt; what would you look for in ko-mino work? I have\n  &gt; been\n  &gt; looking for a piece like this for a long time and I\n  &gt; think I did well on the purchase.
