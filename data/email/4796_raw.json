The scan you put in my folder.  The one top left=\r\n is identical to mine.  Same crickets. And the signature is identical to th=\r\ne one someone posted as a mino.  So now I know about the tsuba.  So what ab=\r\nout the sword?  Is the maker of the sword and the tsuba generally completel=\r\ny different people?  schools?  are they totally disassociated or might ther=\r\ne be some swordsmiths that tended to use tsubas from this particular school=\r\n?\n   \n  Becky\n\nCurran Campbell &lt;neobliviscar@...&gt; wrote:\n          Be=\r\ncky,\n\nI posted a scan in your folder. It should answer most\nof your questio=\r\nn. According to Gary Murtha&#39;s Sword\nFittings book pg 44, it is probably a t=\r\nsuba by Kyoto\nKiyonori or one of his students.\n\nI&#39;ve seen this tsuba a few =\r\ntimes over the years. If\nyou (carefully) remove the pin holding on the tsuk=\r\na\nand look at the face of the tsuba that was under the\ntsuka, you will (may=\r\nbe 50/50 %) see a gold &#39;KAO&#39; mark\nlike that on the tsuba images uploaded to=\r\n your folder.\nThe Kao will probably allow us to attribute it to a\nspecific =\r\nperson, althought the KAO shown by Murtha and\nthat recorded by Haynes are s=\r\nomewhat different for\nthese guys. Still, we should have a good idea.\n\nAccor=\r\nding to Murtha, Kiyonori was &quot;A Kyoto artist.\nSigned with gold inlaid kao. =\r\nHis favorite design being\ncrickets in grass. One of his students was Atsuiy=\r\ne who\nchanged his name to Noriiye.&quot;\n\nThey are nice tsubas. One of the fello=\r\nw listmembers\nhad one a few years back. If he sold it, he could\nprobably te=\r\nll you the value best.\nI did not look closely, but do the fuchi-kashira\nmat=\r\nch the tsuba in design? That would be nice.\n\nCurran\n\n--- Becky &lt;SNDE92BW@pr=\r\nodigy.net&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; Ok, I posted my picture. Apologies to Ron ?
