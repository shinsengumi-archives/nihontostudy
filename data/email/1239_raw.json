If they were shipped with koshirae, would they have bothered with kozuka and kogai?  If they were mounted in China, would there be any reason for them to be fitted out like a Japanese sword?  The signed guard in the Boston museum collection has kozuka and kogai ana, so it was presumably made for a Japanese-style mount, or perhaps just copied from a Japanese tsuba treating the ana as part of the decoration rather than for use. \n\nJim\n  -\n\n\n  Jim. that would be interesting, as at the start of the Kangxi period,\n  the whole of China was effectively still at war since the Qing were\n  taking over from the earlier Ming dynasty rulers. \n\n  When dating Chinese porcelain, we make use of a term called the\n  &quot;Transitional Period&quot; that lasts from 1620 - 1683 approx to indicate\n  that these pieces were made during a time of great turmoil, when the\n  imperial porcealain factories were not functioning (they had been\n  ransacked)............ however I digress.\n\n  We also know that hundreds of thousands of Japanese swords were exported\n  to the Chinese Court from the Kamakura period onwards into the 15th\n  century. However I have no literature stating that this continued into\n  the 17th cent, does anyone know anything about that ?\n\n  One can just imagine some metal worker in Nanking making a tsuba for his\n  Great Grandfathers treasured Japanese sword to take it to war once\n  again........ \n\n  I  might add it is extremely unusual for any Chinese artisan to sign\n  their work with the exception of perhaps paintings. \n\n  Matt\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
