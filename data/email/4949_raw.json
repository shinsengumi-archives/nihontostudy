I am well acquainted with this smith as I have had a katana of his for many years plus others of the school are well-known to me in other collections.  And I have the Hizento Taikan.  And I have a book on kogatana.  So, please post me pics direct or I&#39;m happy to look at them in your album.  Higher res is better then lower res to send me direct, as you might resize them down for your album.\n\nI&#39;m presuming here that you want to know if the mei is genuine??\n\nRegards,\nBarry Thomas.\n\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: Elliott \n  To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Tuesday, March 27, 2007 3:16 AM\n  Subject: [nihontostudy] kogatana mei\n\n\n  It&#39;s me again...........\n\n  I am seeking any information about.... Omi Daijo Fujiwara Tadashiro .\n  The kogatana that I have has this mei. I cannot find the \n  name &#39;Tadashiro&#39; anywhere. And since I cannot read kanji, I question \n  this name.\n\n  As soon as I can get a viewable picture of this mei (and another), I \n  will post to my album for all to critique. Meanwhile with your help, I \n  will continue searching........\n\n  Thanks as always,\n\n  Elliott \n  .,_._,___ \n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
