The late Tom Buttweiler&#39;s artice, &quot;The History of Pre-Edo Menuki&quot; was nicely illustrated and clearly showed the various styles of menuki that evolved during that time-frame in history. That article was a key stimulus that set me off on my fascination with early menuki. This publication would really be a worthwhile one for the NCJSC to consider reprinting one day. If not that, then perhaps the JSS/US could get permission to reprint several of these papers in their newsletter. \n\nAnother 2-volume set of books out of Germany several years ago (1995) -- one volume on tsuba, the other on kodogu -- had a pretty good section on menuki. I&#39;m not sure of the formal title to the &quot;set&quot; but it was by H. U. B. Verlag (ISBM 3-931150-00-3). Nice large photographs with the text translated into English, German and Japanese.\n\nIn all these years I have seen only one small illustrated article that dealt with the making of menuki. That appeared in a NBTHK Token Bijutsu journal perhaps 15 years ago and showed a modern day menuki maker creating his works. Years later I tried to locate that article to get it translated, but I never did locate it again. Not much written (in depth) about menuki, so it seems. \n\nRon\nSTL\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: David Zincavage \n  To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Monday, July 25, 2005 1:44 PM\n  Subject: Re: [nihontostudy] Re: Menuki Thoughts?\n\n\n  Bob McCoy provides the following in an undated  NCJSC fact sheet distributed with an unknown issue of To-Ron.   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n       References:\n\n        1.                 &quot;Menuki, The magnificent Miniatures&quot; By R.B.

I had given up on the thread attracting any\n    reply. Is there any way to estimate a period on menuki like this, or\n    are they usually just lumped into the &quot;late edo&quot; period?\n    I haven&#39;t seen a lot of info on menuki anywhere. Are there any\n    (English) books with a decent chapter on menuki at all, and what are\n    the things to look out for in early menuki?\n\n    Regards,\n    Brian\n\n    --- In nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Jim Gilbert&quot; &lt;jggilbert@E...&gt; wrote:\n    &gt; Brian,\n    &gt; They&#39;re not Goto, although they are following the style.  I don&#39;t\n    think that it is possible to attribute them to a specific group.  At\n    shinsa work like this is often described as Kyo-Kanagushi (Kyoto metal\n    fittings maker). \n    &gt; \n    &gt; Jim\n    &gt; \n    &gt; \n    &gt; \n    &gt;   Hi all,\n    &gt;   I recently made an offer on a set of menuki on eBay, and got them. I&#39;m\n    &gt;   not a fittings guy at all, but wanted a nice pair for a future\n    &gt;   mounting project, and as an example for study.\n    &gt;   They were described as Goto or at least waki-goto. I doubt they are \n    &gt;   Goto...but am wondering if anyone has any thoughts on the quality,\n    &gt;   school etc? Are there any identifying marks on menuki that might lead\n    &gt;   towards a certain school?\n    &gt;   Was really attracted to them because of the fine carving work, and\n    &gt;   detail. The colour is a nice dark brownish-black shakudo, not like the\n    &gt;   lighting in the photo shows.\n    &gt;   They are actually nicer than in the pics..with some very fine carving,\n    &gt;   and detail on the toes, ribs, tail etc. Some odd marks on the\n    &gt;   legs..which are 2 ovals with a small dot in the middle.\n    &gt;   Middle to late edo I assume? Condition is very good. Any comments from\n    &gt;   &quot;menuki guys&quot; appreciated.\n    &gt; \n    &gt;   Pic is at\n    &gt;   http://www.image-hosting.net/images/messageboard/retalt/Menuki.jpg\n    &gt; \n    &gt;   Thanks,\n    &gt;   Brian \n    &gt; \n    &gt; \n    &gt; \n    &gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n\n    SPONSORED LINKS Art history  Fine art  Art history book  \n          Fine art lamps  Fine art online  Fine art poster  \n\n\n  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    YAHOO!
