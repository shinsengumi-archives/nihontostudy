I have had many long =\r\nand very enjoyable conversations with Roger Robertshaw about a katana blade=\r\n I currently own. It appears to be an early Tadayoshi blade. This is confir=\r\nmed by a sayagaki and a presentation inscription dated 1922.\nI am reasonabl=\r\ny confident that it is indeed early Hizen work. However Roger is rightly sc=\r\neptical about the existence of unsigned Hizen work being attributed to the =\r\nmainline school. With a nagasa of 65.2cm. there is just the possibility tha=\r\nt it is O-suriage and has lost the original signature. Alternatively it cou=\r\nld be that it was never signed. I intend to submit the blade at the forthco=\r\nming NTHK shinsa in London. Does anyone know of unsigned Tadayoshi blades t=\r\nhat have received papers?\nany opinions and information much appreciated\ntha=\r\nnks\nPaul\n\n\n---------------------------------\nWant to chat instantly with yo=\r\nur online friends?=A0Get the FREE Yahoo!Messenger\n\n[Non-text portions of th=\r\nis message have been removed]\n\n\n"
