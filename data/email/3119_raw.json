(lot n=\r\no 722) It then goes on to list a few pages of Kyo \ntsuba.  It would seem th=\r\nat by their working definition that Curran&#39;s \nexplanation of Ko-Kyo might b=\r\ne correct given that the Heianjo is \nearly-mid 15th C while the others are =\r\nmore than a century later.  \n\n--- In nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com, Gordon R=\r\nobson &lt;robsongo@s...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; Hi,\n&gt; \n&gt; The old term Heianjo Sukashi is no=\r\n longer in use having been \nreplaced \n&gt; by Kyo-Sukushi. If you have an olde=\r\nr book, you will still see this \n&gt; term. This also helps avoid confusion wi=\r\nth Heianjo tsuba, which \nare \n&gt; typically thin iron plates with brass inlay=\r\ns.\n&gt; \n&gt; Gordon\n&gt; \n&gt; On 2005/07/11, at 1:54, Curran Campbell wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; I=\r\n think I asked this same question of Jim or somebody\n&gt; &gt; else not long ago.=\r\n It confused me a bit regarding a\n&gt; &gt; tsuba I was studying at the time.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; My understanding is that it is more of an age\n&gt; &gt; division. For exampl=\r\ne, exact same Sasano tsuba is\n&gt; &gt; photographed in 2 books. It is a mid 1500=\r\ns piece. In\n&gt; &gt; the older book it is called &#39;Heian Jo Sukashi&#39;. In\n&gt; &gt; anot=\r\nher book it is called &#39;Kyo Sukashi&#39; and the age is\n&gt; &gt; denoted in the subse=\r\nquent description.\n&gt; &gt;   I suppose you could call it a &quot;ko kyo&quot; sukashi, bu=\r\nt\n&gt; &gt; sounds odd to me.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I would have thought Richard George&#39;s first=\r\n tsuba\n&gt; &gt; could be called &quot;Heianjo Sukashi&quot; or late Muromachi.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n Curran\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- David Zincavage &lt;jdz@i...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; I&#39;m =\r\na bit puzzled about Heianjo sukashi tsubas.

Heianjo, in this case,=\r\n I would\n&gt; &gt;&gt; assume, just means they were made in Kyoto.  So, how\n&gt; &gt;&gt; wou=\r\nld Heianjo sukashi be different from  Kyo\n&gt; &gt;&gt; sukashi?
