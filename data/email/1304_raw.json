Also distinct is the mimi which has a sharp roundness on it&#39;s outside wall and is known as Kittate on the inner wall ( Sharp as a cliff )There is also a terndancy for one typical hitsuana and the other that totally blends into the design of the tsuba. I know ther eis a term fo rthis but cannot fo rthe life of me remember it.\n\nThis I found in Tsuba, an aesthitic Study in regards to the Akao school. \nThe tsuba of this school; for the most part, whether made in Echizen of Iron plate ( I believe mine fits this category ) or in Edo of kawarigane plate, are better than the late works of  the shoami school and the kinko. The early work of this school shows the superior ability above that of the majority of the contemporary workers of the period. The number of tsuba made by this school was few, and they were kakae-ko ( artist who worked exclusively for a daimyo family ). The general public very rarely had a chance to see the work of artists who were patronized by daimyo families. For this reason the style of the Akao school never had a chance to catch the fancy of the public. It was not imitated in great quantities as were the popular styles.\n \nJim et all, are they that rare or does it just read like that. I have just recently picked up a nice Akao guard with Nihon Tosogu Bijutsukan Bunka Shiryoo Origami. I have added pics in the Rich T folder on the board titles akao1 and 2. The photo&#39;s do not do it justice.\n\nhttp://tinyurl.com/ywzdx\n\nCheers\n\nRich\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
