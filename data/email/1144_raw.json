They also mounted their single-edged blades in edge-down orientation.  Even given that the nakago was changed, the shape of the blade is unusual and the shape of that habaki is also pretty odd.  \n\nKeith M., what do you think?\n\nJim\n\n\n\n  Yeah, I think the nakago was altered. David commented that it looked like a\n  kris, which is Indonesian.\n\n\n\n  Gordon\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
