Sukidashi-bori and sukidashi\n&gt; takabori are used when\n&gt; there is carving that digs downward into the flat\n&gt; surface of the tsuba and\n&gt; creates high relief carvings. Such carving typically\n&gt; does not include\n&gt; sukashi work.\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Gordon\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt;   _____  \n&gt; \n&gt; From: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; [mailto:nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com] On\n&gt; Behalf Of Ron Hartmann\n&gt; Sent: Friday, April 04, 2008 10:48 AM\n&gt; To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: Re: [nihontostudy] Tsuba carving\n&gt; terminology\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; One more example tsuba has been added to my photos -\n&gt; Ron STL album - tsuba\n&gt; #627 and 227 are the ones I&#39;m referring to. \n&gt; \n&gt; Tsuba 227 design is all made (carved) below its\n&gt; plate surface the same as\n&gt; 627 except this one is more elaborately done with\n&gt; the plum blossom branch\n&gt; design. \n&gt; \n&gt; Also an interesting tsuba that has a Choshu design\n&gt; but the work is much more\n&gt; thin and delicate and looks more Kyoto-something to\n&gt; me...could it be\n&gt; Kyo-Shoami?

(In this\n&gt; case, the tsuba is\n&gt; actually tapered, the flat edge being 1 mm less than\n&gt; the seppa-dai surface.)\n&gt; In the Boston book Ogawa called this sukidashi\n&gt; takabori in the Hayne/Harvie\n&gt; study book it seems to be called horiage (if I&#39;m\n&gt; understanding the\n&gt; description correction) and also another term which\n&gt; I can&#39;t find right now. \n&gt; \n&gt; Is there a common name for this type of sunken\n&gt; relief carving? \n&gt; \n&gt; Ron\n&gt; STL\n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been\n&gt; removed]\n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been\n&gt; removed]\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been\n&gt; removed]\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n"
