I added two new mon scans from Milt&#39;s book to the jim/wisteria photo album:\n\nhttp://tinyurl.com/cfw7  (thanks Milt)\n\nI found only one single strand fuji mon with the leaves at the top, although as Milt mentioned there are a lot of double strand ones with that orientation.  I noticed that all but one mon, regardless of flowers going up or down, have the three leaf cluster pointing &quot;up.&quot;  I added a scan of that one, too.  \n\nSo with all of these mon, none are an exact match to the guard in katana orientation, although there are these two mon that are close.  There is a very good match already posted in tachi orientation.\n\nI&#39;ll write some more later,\nJim\n\n\n\n  John und all,\n  May be your perception is prejudiced by the 4 mon Jim posted.\n  If in deed the wisteria motif represent a mon on that tsuba, there \n  are many mon with the wisteria hanging down the natural way.\n  From the big mon book Tom bought for me while he&#39;s in Japan, I \n  counted over 20 mon with wisteria hanging down.\n  I sent the illustrations to Jim, may be Jim can post some of those \n  onto the list album ( the scans I sent are not of the higest \n  quality )?\n\n  Milt\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
