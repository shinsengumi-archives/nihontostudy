Here are a couple other cheap books in English worth having:  The \nJapanese Sword: A Comprehensive Guide by Kanzan Sato, usually found cheap at \nAmazon or other book sellers;\nJAPANESE SWORDSMITHS: Commemorative Centenary Edition by W.Hawley can be \nfound at www.satcho.com or other book sellers, not perfect, but the best \navailable in English.\nModern Japanese Swordsmiths; 1868-1945, by John Slough available for about \n$100 is well worth it, if you are into WWII gendaito, showato blades.  Hope \nthat helps,\nMike\n\n\n&gt;From: Andres Pedraza &lt;apedraza@...&gt;\n&gt;Reply-To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;Subject: RE: [nihontostudy] new release dvd\n&gt;Date: Thu, 04 Aug 2005 09:22:17 -0400\n&gt;\n&gt;Mark,\n&gt;\n&gt;I have both books. Yumoto&#39;s is a magnificent pocket reference,\n&gt;although a bit dated. The Connoisseur&#39;s is a much more detailed\n&gt;reference, covering the same ground as Yumoto&#39;s, but with more\n&gt;examples of every feature a nihonto can have. Curiously enough, every\n&gt;now and then I see it being offered on eBay, sometimes reaching bid\n&gt;amounts above 100 dollars. For the life of me, I can&#39;t understand\n&gt;why. Not that the book isn&#39;t worth it, but because it&#39;s still\n&gt;available off the shelf at Amazon for less than 50 bucks:\n&gt;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?path=ASIN/4770020716&link_code=as2&camp=1789&tag=lairofthenecr-20&creative=9325\n&gt;\n&gt;Now, that being said, the Connoisseur&#39;s is probably the best\n&gt;reference available in English. It pales in comparison to published\n&gt;in Japan nihonto reference books which can make the Connoisseur&#39;s\n&gt;look like the pocket reference version.\n&gt;\n&gt;Lastly, another book I found to be a good read, especially as it\n&gt;covers nihonto manufacture, is The Craft of the Japanese Sword, by\n&gt;Leon Kapp, also available from Amazon:\n&gt;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?path=ASIN/087011798X&link_code=as2&camp=1789&tag=lairofthenecr-20&creative=9325\n&gt;\n&gt;Hope that helps.\n&gt;\n&gt;Regards,\n&gt;\n&gt;Andres\n&gt;\n&gt;At 08:39 AM 8/4/2005, you wrote:\n&gt; &gt;Guess you&#39;re missing Andres point here.  This is a message board, NOT an\n&gt; &gt;advertising board. You posted your message once, everyone would have seen\n&gt; &gt;it, you did your job. You have plenty of other venues to peddle this dvd.\n&gt; &gt;Unfortunately, THIS place isn&#39;t it.\n&gt; &gt;THAT was the point Andres was trying to make.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Just got John Yumoto&#39;s &quot;The Samurai Sword&quot; in the mail yesterday!  Any\n&gt; &gt;sugestions out there for a must have &quot;second&quot; reference book? Just \n&gt;keeping\n&gt; &gt;things basic at this point. Not specializing in any one specific area \n&gt;yet.\n&gt; &gt;Has anyone read &quot;The Connoisseur&#39;s Book of Japoanese Swords&quot;?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Mark\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;   -----Original Message-----\n&gt; &gt;   From: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n&gt;[mailto:nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com]On\n&gt; &gt;Behalf Of ritchey sealy\n&gt; &gt;   Sent: Thursday, August 04, 2005 4:23 AM\n&gt; &gt;   To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt;   Subject: Re: [nihontostudy] new release dvd\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;   then you will miss out this  a very high standard dvd iv seen a lot on \n&gt;the\n&gt; &gt;market an this one beats them all as far as practical info goes  but \n&gt;thanks\n&gt; &gt;for the suggestion iv seen it you havent\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;   Andres Pedraza &lt;apedraza@...&gt; wrote:This looks to be the\n&gt; &gt;same link posted a day or two ago.
