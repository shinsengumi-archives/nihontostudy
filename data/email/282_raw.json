(I had a naginata pole with what appeared\nto be fabric under the lacquer once...)\n\nrkg\n(Richard George)\n\n&gt;A friend of mine just sent some photos of a leather nagamaki tsuba from his collection.  I put them up at:\n&gt;\n&gt;http://tinyurl.com/d2ee\n&gt;\n&gt;His description:\n&gt;\n&gt;&quot;Attached are the pix of that leather nagamaki tsuba I was telling you about.  It is 3.5  inches in diameter and .25 inches thick.  It is made from two pieces of leather and it appears that there may be a fabric covering under the lacquer..you can see a weave looking design on the edges where the lacquer is cracked away.  This particular tsuba fit on the pole about a foot behind the blade.  There is a four pointed iron guard device that goes in front of it.  I don&#39;t have the whole pole, but I do have all the forward parts.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;Jim\n&gt;\n&gt;[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt;nihontostudy-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;\n&gt;Your use of Yahoo!
