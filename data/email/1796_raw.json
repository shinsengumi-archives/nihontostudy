It would be much easier to \nall be on the same time but of course but I would probably have to go to \nwork in the middle of the night and try and sleep in the broad daylight. \nLooking at swords would be a drag as well. Oh well, happy April fools to \nyou all, in case you need a laugh  \nhttp://www.museumofhoaxes.com/aprilfool2.html\n\nSorry for this digression, there was a tiny bit of sword content in there.\n\nRich\n\n\n\nalchemyst wrote:\n\n&gt; --- In nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com, Richard Turner &lt;ikkanshi@w...&gt;\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; That was yesterday Gordon, I think he is serious, he is digging out\n&gt; his\n&gt; &gt; Pamela Anderson Tsuba for me to see :-)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Rich T\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Rich -\n&gt;\n&gt; It is April 1 here today.
