That would be Enjo, the \n13th mainline Goto, 1721-1784.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m not very confident about the mei, but I don&#39;t want to judge \nfrom the photos.  You should be able to find published examples for \ncomparison.\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; Jim \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   Can any kind and knowledgeable member assist me in the \nidentification \n&gt;   of the maker of the kodzuka illustrated in my photo album JPL?\n&gt; \n&gt;   The obverse is horizontal shakudo nanako, surrounded by a raised \nrim.  \n&gt;   At the centre are depicted two horses in high relief, one of \ngold and \n&gt;   the other of shakudo.  The reverse is of polished shakudo and, \n&gt;   unfortunately, the mei is too badly rubbed to be easily \nidentified.  \n&gt;   It consists of five characters, the fourth of which may \nbe &#39;taka&#39; and \n&gt;   the fifth probably a kao.  The first two kangi are NOT Yanagawa!\n&gt; \n&gt;   I fear that the very unsatisfactory photograph is the best \npossible, \n&gt;   considering the state of the mei but, given a suggested maker, I \nmay \n&gt;   be able to marry that name to what remainss of the kangi.\n&gt; \n&gt;   With thanks in anticipation, John L.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n\n"
