One or two tekkotsu are usually more interesting than none.  Most good pieces of the types that have tekkotsu will have them distributed here and there around the rim.  Some pieces are positively bristling with them, and while it&#39;s a matter of taste it can get to be a bit much.  While one or two small bones may not have much carry much &quot;aesthetic weight&quot; they are a pretty good clue that the iron is not just homogenous factory plate.\n\n2.  Yes, they&#39;re mostly visible on the rim only, although Kanayama, Yamakichi, Hoan, etc., will show them on the face as well.  I think that it may be a function more of how the plate is finished than the forging.  If you file/grind/sand the surface down, the bones aren&#39;t going to be visible unless some later process (rust, wear, ?) brings them out.  I think that where to &quot;put&quot; or &quot;leave&quot; bones was an aesthetic choice.\n\n3.  There are running bones and there is masame hada.  The ones that really look like masame hada are just the layers in the iron.  I think typically if they stand out the guard was finished with some sort of etching process, or the layers were brought out by rusting.  A running bone is not as obvious or as uniform as masame hada.  It&#39;s a true tekkotsu that will be visible for a centimeter or few around the rim.  It is also probably following a higher carbon layer, but it&#39;s not as obvious as a masame hada.  It&#39;s frequently seen in early Akasaka.\n\n4.  Without seeing the piece I don&#39;t know.  I&#39;ve never seen inlay used to fill in voids in the forging, though.  On the other hand, if some of the gold fell out, you will still see the slots cut for the inlay.  Nunome should be a definite but shallow cross hatch (cloth) pattern.  Of course hira-zogan or other techniques would be small cuts.   \n\nShort form answers, but I hope that gets at your questions.\n\nJim\n\n  &gt;\n  yes, of course. That was meant as a &quot; comment &quot; on prices achieved so \n  the juyo level tsuba does not appear &quot; ridiculous &quot; .\n\n  Questions on tsuba......\n  1. what&#39;s the ball park figure on amount of bones that usually appear \n  in iron tsuba ? Is one or two still consider &quot; good &quot; ( better than \n  none )? I have a few that show no more than two  while others are \n  allover the place ( mimi, that is ).\n  2.  I notice most bones appear on the mimi but not( usually ) the flat \n  surface, is it due to the forging process ? ( may be because I don&#39;t \n  have the fortune to own a Yamakichibai , EARLY Hoan? =(  )\n  3.I have notice a few tsuba that show running bones, almost like masame \n  hada , are they bones or just folding process that show the layers ?\n  4. The ko-Shoami tsuba I have in the folder also show traces of &quot; \n  hada &quot;, I notice one on the mimi that is a circle (like mokume ) which \n  is not bone, may be the gold nunome on the flat surfce of the rim is to \n  fill in those &quot; openining edges &quot; of mokume hada as I see nodefinite \n  pattern to the nunome ?\n\n  Muchias Gracias.......\n\n  milt\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
