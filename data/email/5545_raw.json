From what I can tell  \nit was made around 1943ish by Asano Kanasane I have attached a picture of what \nI  have found on reference. The Mei is to me an exact match of example &quot;C&quot;. \n \nThere is a small chip on the Ho, that is almost not viewable but it is  \n&quot;feelable&quot; as well as several parry marks on the Mune. The very end of the  Kissaki \n(approx  1/16&quot;) is broken off.\n\nFrom the sources I have found this blade was very probably a showato  sword \nmade for the Japanese Army. There are no other mounts or anything.\n \nNow I know this isn&#39;t a &quot;real collectable&quot; but for the &quot;investment&quot; I made  I \nfeel that it would be worth a decent polish as I can see a great deal of  \nactivity along the Hamon even through the very light oxidation on the  blade.\n \nI will send some photos once I get them taken (my photographic  skills  are \nmarginal at best) if there is any interest.  My skills lay more in the  \nmetalworking end of things...\n \nSO if anyone on the list is interested in helping out an old hammerhead I  \nwould appreciate it..\n \nJPH  \n\nDr JP  Hrisoulas, COL NANG (Ret)\nBladesmith.\nAuthor: The Complete  Bladesmith\nThe Master Bladesmith\nThe Pattern Welded Blade\nhttp: _www.atar.com_ (http://www.atar.com/) \n\n\n\n**************A Good Credit Score is 700 or Above.
