The only mention in regards to the Boshi was that it \nwas &#39;ha=\r\nrd to see&#39;. It was never said to me that it was missing or \nrunning off. I =\r\nalso had no idea this was considered a fatal flaw. \n\nIt would have been all=\r\n right to tell me that polishing would not \nmake the Boshi appear. And at t=\r\nhat point, I would have probably ask \nfor the blade returned to me. As far =\r\nas the NTHK (or any other group)\nand their Shinsa, all I wanted was their o=\r\npinion as to whether the \nblade was Sue-Bizen or Shinto-Bizen. \n\nAs I told =\r\nyou before, I have learned from this experience and that \nis good. I don&#39;t =\r\nhold anything against anybody. I will continue to \nask questions of you and=\r\n do future business with you. All is well!\n\nElliott\n\n\n\n\n--- In nihontostudy=\r\n@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Moses Becerra&quot; &lt;kenzento@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;  I am surprise=\r\nd at this email Elliott.  I recommended Shinsa \nbecause \n&gt; overall the swor=\r\nd was in good condition.  The Boshi was a gamble \nbut \n&gt; worth trying.  I d=\r\nid tell you before the Shinsa all of this didn&#39;t \nI?\n&gt; \n&gt; Moses Becerra\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com, &quot;elliottshogun&quot; &lt;elliott@&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I did not know that a Boshi running off the tip was consi=\r\ndered a \n&gt; &gt; fatal flaw. Thats why I joined this group. To learn. And of \nc=\r\nourse, \n&gt; &gt; polishing the blade would not make the Boshi come back. \nActual=\r\nly, \n&gt; &gt; this blade did not need a polish, everything was in place \n(except=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; for the missing temper line). I am surprized that Moses didn&#39;t \n&gt; poi=\r\nnt \n&gt; &gt; this out to me and recommend possibly not submitting it for \nShinsa=\r\n. \n&gt; &gt; Again, this is all part of learning.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Thank you both (Paul &=\r\n Rich) for furthering my education.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Elliott \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com, paul bowman &lt;bowman1955@&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; just to balance the comment made earlier, yes I ag=\r\nree with \nRich, \n&gt; &gt; if the hamon runs off the sword would not paper unless=\r\n it was an \n&gt; &gt; historically important smith or blade. I have seen 1 Juyo w=\r\nhere \n&gt; &gt; there is apparently no boshi. cant remember who by but it was \nve=\r\nry \n&gt; &gt; early and by a top smith. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Richard Turner &lt;ikkanshi@&gt; =\r\nwrote:          Just a curiosity, \n&gt; &gt; does the temper run off the kissaki,=\r\n if so, is this \n&gt; &gt; &gt; not a fatal flaw and not being an historically impor=\r\ntant \npiece, \n&gt; &gt; would \n&gt; &gt; &gt; not paper with any group.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Cheer=\r\ns\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Rich\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; elliottshogun wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I agr=\r\nee with Paul, the NTHK should say something about the \npiece\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; they a=\r\nre about to &#39;pink slip&#39;.
