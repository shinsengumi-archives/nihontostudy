I do\n&gt; not recall\n&gt; &gt; eve=\r\nr seeing a first generation Yasutsugu with a Namban-tetsu\n&gt; inscription,\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; and if one exits, being dated will be extraordinary.

About this time\n&gt; &gt; Yasutsugu was given the pr=\r\nivilege of using the character &quot;Yasu&quot;\n&gt; from\n&gt; &gt; Tokugawa Ieyasu&#39;s name. Th=\r\nus he changed his name to Yasutsugu from\n&gt; &gt; that point on. About the same =\r\ntime ( some feel it was a few years\n&gt; &gt; later) he was given the additional =\r\nprivilege of carving the\n&gt; Hollyhock\n&gt; &gt; crest ( Aoi mon) on his blades. Th=\r\nese privileges were given in\n&gt; &gt; perpetuity to Yasutsugu and his descendent=\r\ns. Thus the Yasutsugu\n&gt; &gt; swordsmiths became the kaji of the Tokugawa Famil=\r\ny.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Earlier I raised the question of what made Yasutsugu&#39;s fame and\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; fortune seem to spread disproportionately to his skill when we\n&gt; &gt; comp=\r\nare him to some of his contemporary smiths such as Umetada\n&gt; Myoju\n&gt; &gt; and =\r\nHorikawa Kunihiro. About this time, non oriental foreigners\n&gt; made\n&gt; &gt; thei=\r\nr presence felt in Japan for the first time. Things from\n&gt; &gt; the &quot;West&quot; wer=\r\ne new, exciting, strange, and highly sought after.\n&gt; &gt; Yasutsugu was one of=\r\n the first advocates of using namban tetsu\n&gt; &gt; (foreign steel) in his sword=\r\ns. He proudly incised this fact on the\n&gt; &gt; nakago of his later works. It wa=\r\ns new, it was exciting, and there\n&gt; is\n&gt; &gt; no doubt that this use of foreig=\r\nn steel helped spread his fameis is\n&gt; &gt; from an article on nihonto.com\n&gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; --- In nihontostudy@ &lt;mailto:nihontostudy%40yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; &gt; yahoog=\r\nroups.com, &quot;Alan Bale&quot; &lt;abale@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; To All,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Yasutsugu =\r\n1st inscribed &#39;Nanban tetsu wo motte&#39; on some of his\n&gt; &gt; swords, according =\r\nto the Meikan his dated blades range from 1613 to\n&gt; &gt; 1621\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Alan\n&gt; &gt; .=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n\n&gt;\n&gt; \n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
