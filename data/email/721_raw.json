The lawful use and possession of a &quot;prohibited\n  weapon&quot; requires an Approval from the Chief Commissioner of Police (for\n  which a fee is charged). Persons may be exempted from this requirement\n  by the Governor-in-Council. A person, therefore, under the proposed\n  Regulations, could still lawfully own and possess a sword if, for\n  example, they obtained an Approval to do so from the Chief Commissioner\n  of Police.\n\n  The proposed Regulations will not necessitate destruction of swords. In\n  the event that the proposed Regulations come into operation, persons in\n  possession of a sword who do not obtain an Approval from the Chief\n  Commissioner of Police and who do not fall under an exemption granted by\n  the Governor-in-Council could dispose of their weapons through, for\n  example, an authorised weapons trader.\n\n  The Regulatory Impact Statement (RIS) which assesses the impact of the\n  proposed Regulations has been publicly released and I attach a copy of\n  the RIS for your information. Should you wish to make a further\n  submission on the proposed Regulations after reading the RIS (the\n  proposed Regulations themselves are at Attachment 1 to the RIS) you\n  would be most welcome to do so. The closing date for submissions is\n  Monday 8 September 2003. Details on how to make a submission can be\n  found in the RIS.\n\n  Further copies of the Regulatory Impact Statement can be accessed on the\n  internet at www.justice.vic.gov.au\n\n  Thank you for raising your views with the Department of Justice.\n\n  Yours sincerely\n\n  Signed\n\n  Marisa De Cicco\n  Director, Justice Policy\n\n\n  (See attached file: Control of Weapons - Firearms Regulatory Impact\n  Statement.pdf)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  _________________________________________\n  ***CONFIDENTIAL***\n  The information in this message and in any attachments may be\n  confidential.
