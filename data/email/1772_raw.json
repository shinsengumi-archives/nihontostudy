Seems\n&gt; generally ok.\n&gt; Watch the postage though if your country is not listed..\n&gt; $21 postage on a small tsuba??\n&gt; And seems like they won&#39;t combine shipping to save you money on \nother\n&gt; items won...some funny excuse about company policy or something.\n\nI&#39;ve actually got a combined shipping from them for 2 tsuba. It was 2-\n3 months ago, so I don&#39;t know, maybe they aren&#39;t doing it anymore.\n\nAgain, personally, I&#39;ve got no major complaints about this seller: \nshipping was fast, well packaged in respect to tsuba, etc. I wouldn&#39;t \nhesitate to buy from him again once I see something I&#39;d be interested \nin.\n\nRegards,\n  Stan\n\n\n"
