My understanding is that Masamune is a really \nfamous smith, and all his works are national treasures, so I assume his \ndisciples work would be as well. This blade on ebay, is there a \ncharacteristic that makes it so valuable? The type of hamon or the etched \ndesigns? I&#39;m trying to appreciate this blade but don&#39;t know where to look. \nCould someone give me a few pointers??\n\nThanks,\nRobert (japanese sword appreciation guy in training)\n\n&gt;From: &quot;Barry Thomas&quot; &lt;warlord@...&gt;\n&gt;Reply-To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;To: &lt;nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt;Subject: Re: [nihontostudy] one heck of a tsuba?\n&gt;Date: Tue, 14 Oct 2003 00:19:13 +1000\n&gt;\n&gt;Is this a real tsuba?????????????!!!!!
