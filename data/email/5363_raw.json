The 3-leaf sukashi (if that what it is) does resemble kiri leaves but I wanted to hear that from somebody else. The strange patina is just the quality of the photo...probably a scan. Oddly, that off-color shows up the black lacquer, at least I think that&#39;s what I&#39;m seeing on the posted view. I find this rather fascinating little tsuba, my reason for seeking some feedback from fresh eyes. \n\nI&#39;m going to send a couple &quot;tests&quot; out after this email. Strange, my nihontostudy email and yahoo email both came back here and was dumped into my spam folder. No replies needed for the &quot;test.&quot; \n\nRon\nSTL\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: excelsiorilluminati \n  To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Wednesday, March 19, 2008 4:22 PM\n  Subject: [nihontostudy] Re: Tsuba kantie\n\n\n  Hi Ron, A rather strange patina. Looks brassy coloured in areas. \n  Lighting probably, eh? The sukashi look to be kirimon in shape. Don&#39;t \n  know about the ovals. Nice for a change, from marugata.

It is iron sukashi work of a very unusual (undescribable, \n  to me) shape and design. It measures 70mm x 58mm x 6mm and has \n  remnants of black lacquer remaining on it. The hitsu-ana pillows are \n  interesting in that hey are double-layered, the inside inlay being \n  shakudo with a silver overlaid plate. The tsuba has not been cut \n  down so this is its original shape, in my opinion. Obviously it has \n  been refitted many times. A photo is posted in nihontostudy pictures \n  under Ron STL.
