There are tsuba where the seppa=\r\n dai has been enlarged by\n&gt;   &gt; fitting pieces all of the way around.  Some=\r\ntimes various pieces\n&gt;   &gt; (including the more common hitsuana plugs) are i=\r\nnserted by a later\n&gt;   &gt; collector to restore the look of the guard to some=\r\nthing like what he\n&gt;   &gt; believes to be its original state.\n&gt;   &gt;\n&gt;   &gt; I c=\r\nould imagine a piece like being inserted to repair damage if it\n&gt;   &gt; were =\r\nsomewhere else on the guard.  It&#39;s hard to imagine how that\n&gt;   &gt; particula=\r\nr spot would be damaged.\n&gt;   &gt;\n&gt;   &gt; I have seen a fair number of tsuba tha=\r\nt have a pronounced \n&gt; asymmetry to\n&gt;   &gt; the shape of the seppa dai in tha=\r\nt location.  There is metal \n&gt; &quot;missing&quot;\n&gt;   &gt; from the same position at th=\r\ne upper right.  My guess is that at some\n&gt;   &gt; time and/or place a slightly=\r\n asymmetrical tsuka or saya shape was in\n&gt;   &gt; style and that tsuba were ei=\r\nther made or modified to accommodate that\n&gt;   &gt; shape.  I haven&#39;t come acro=\r\nss such a koshirae and not being a sword\n&gt;   &gt; user I can&#39;t guess as to why=\r\n such a shape might be desirable.\n&gt;   &gt;\n&gt;   &gt; The insert on your guard migh=\r\nt be an attempt to change one of these\n&gt;   &gt; tsuba to the more common symme=\r\ntrical oval shape.\n&gt;   &gt;\n&gt;   &gt; Any other ideas?\n&gt;   &gt;\n&gt;   &gt; Jim\n&gt;   &gt;\n&gt;   &gt;=\r\n\n&gt;   &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; -------------------------------------------------------------------------=\r\n-----\n&gt;   Yahoo!
