By round, I was picturing a rounded maru m=\r\nimi, not a round cross section.  A round cross section is not typical for e=\r\narly Akasaka guards.  Later when the Akasaka were copying Higo work, they u=\r\nsed their thinner style of round section rim.  I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve seen this=\r\n kind of rim on an Akasaka piece, but I can&#39;t say it&#39;s impossible.  They di=\r\nd some unusual things.\n\nI&#39;m not sure about your piece.  The looseness of th=\r\ne sukashi design reminds me of early Akasaka, although the bird at the top =\r\nis pretty thick for them.  The iron surface shows more &quot;modulation&quot; that is=\r\n typical for Akasaka.  It looks more like something from the Owari region. =\r\n The seppa dai is not far from Akasaka shape.  The guard reminds me a littl=\r\ne of a third generation piece that I have:\n\nhttp://home.earthlink.net/~jggi=\r\nlbert/akasaka.htm  (second guard down from the top).\n\nLooking inside the su=\r\nkashi openings do you see any signs of three layer construction?\n\nTough one=\r\n... it&#39;s bugging me already.  Some Akasaka style, but a lot that is not.  A=\r\nnd I don&#39;t know what the &quot;is not&quot; part is.  Thinking out loud...\n\nJim\n\n\n\n  =\r\nThanks Jim,\n  Yes I did intend to attach a photo, sorry I might get the han=\r\ng of technology in another 30 or 40 years. I have put the image in the albu=\r\nm (I think) under paulb. Please take a look and let me know if its there an=\r\nd what you think.\n  many thanks\n  paul\n\n  Jim Gilbert &lt;jggilbert@EARTHLINK.=\r\nNET&gt; wrote:\n  Paul,\n  A thick, round rim is typical for early Akasaka guard=\r\ns.  Later ones tend to be thinner.  The early Akasaka really favored a very=\r\n &quot;high,&quot; rounded rim compared with other groups working at the same time.\n\n=\r\n  Sometimes tekkotsu are seen in early examples.  Senkotsu is more common, =\r\nwhich is a sort of long linear bone that forms where the inner and outer pl=\r\nates are joined.  \n\n  I&#39;m not sure if you intended there to be an attached =\r\nphoto.  The list doesn&#39;t permit attachments, but you can post images in the=\r\n group photo album at:\n  http://groups.yahoo.com/group/nihontostudy/\n\n  Log=\r\n in and click on the &quot;Photos&quot; link at the left.  I can provide detailed ins=\r\ntructions for anyone who would like to learn how to post photos. It&#39;s quite=\r\n easy.\n\n  Jim \n\n\n\n    Dear All,\n    I have been discussing the tsuba below =\r\nwith a number of friends from both this and another group. The concensus to=\r\n date is that this is early Akasaka. While I am more than content with that=\r\n attribution I was wondering how common the thick round mimi was in Aakasak=\r\na work? Also there are a lot of bones in the mimi. I understand that early =\r\nAkasaka work was influenced by Owari tsuba, is this an example of this? or =\r\nshould I be looking in another direction.\n    All comments greatly apprecia=\r\nted.\n\n\n\n    ---------------------------------\n    Want to chat instantly wi=\r\nth your online friends?
