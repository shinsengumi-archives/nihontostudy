I don&#39;t know about that seller so I can&#39;t comment about\nhis stuff.  If this is a cast iron copy it probably is modern.  A lot of the\nmodern Chinese fakes do get the proportions all wrong, so it&#39;s a matter of\nlearning about early sword mountings.\n&gt;\n&gt; Many early &quot;katana-type&quot; mountings had saya and tsuka that were much\nthinner than what became the convention during and after the Edo period.\nHence the seppa dai (sized to match the saya and tsuka) are small.  The\nearly kozuka and kogai were often very thin, so the ana made to match them\nare narrow.  They were sometimes mounted at angles slightly off from the\nlater 9:00, 3:00 standard.  Also at times it was the fashion to mount rather\nsmall guards on large blades, leaving behind nakago-ana that look\ndisproportionately large.\n&gt;\n&gt; Of course guards from these early mountings are pretty rare, so chances\nare that some misshapen thing on ebay is just a modern fake.\n&gt;\n&gt; Jim\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   Ron that second tsuba reminds me of some of the stuff being sold on ebay\nby\n&gt;   the guy who used to call himself &#39;mrvtjun&#39;, I think he changed his\nhandle to\n&gt;   &#39;po-edo&#39; now or something.\n&gt;   I always thought that quite a few of his tsuba looked funky with\nstrangely\n&gt;   proportioned nakago and hitsu ana. Alot of them do not have a proper\nseppa\n&gt;   dai either. Anyway judging from that dudes feedback alot of them are\ncheap\n&gt;   modern fakes. He gets LOTS of negatives :-) The rest are low quality\n20th\n&gt;   century renditions with some original and papered pieces mixed in.\n&gt;\n&gt;   Could this be such a modern piece also?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   Matt\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
