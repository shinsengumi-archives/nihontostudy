It has a Shin gunto tsuka and a older \nappeari=\r\nng Kyo-sukashi tsuba.  The blade is a bit &quot;rough&quot; but still has \nvery visib=\r\nle hada.  The hamon appears to be Suguha for the most part.\nThe hada is ver=\r\ny prominant, it seems to be a Itame/Mokume mix with \nMasame near the ha.  T=\r\nhe Masame hada also can be clearly seen through \nthe kissaki.  The sword is=\r\n unsigned with a osujikai yasurime. The \nnakago condition appears ( a guess=\r\n ) approx. 1800-1860.  I&#39;m thinking \na late Edo copy of an Koto Yamato.  Na=\r\ngasa 65cm, machi width 3.1 cm, \nyokote 2.1 cm, sori 1.5 cm.  Do these chara=\r\ncteristics suggest to \nanyone a particular Shinshinto School, Smith or Prov=\r\nince. I know it \nwould be difficult with or without blade in hand, but any =\r\nadvice or \ninformation would be appreciated.   Thanks.....\n\n\n\n"
