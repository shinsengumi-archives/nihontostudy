The brass fittings do not look to be of Japanese\n&gt; &gt; &gt; workmanship, especially the lack of a proper and neat finish where the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; metal\n&gt; &gt; &gt; edges meet the scabbard wood. This is especially true where the handle\n&gt; &gt; &gt; butts\n&gt; &gt; &gt; up to the habaki. The lack of a facing metal piece to the habaki\n&gt; indicates\n&gt; &gt; &gt; poor workmanship. It may all be modern, but the proof of the\n&gt; pudding for\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; blade will be when you take the handle off and see the tang. Do this -\n&gt; &gt; &gt; remove the habaki and take good closeup photos of both sides of\n&gt; the tang\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; put them up. The blade is the typical shape of a Meiji tourist\n&gt; piece, but\n&gt; &gt; &gt; running through the images again I&#39;m of the opinion that the\n&gt; koshirae is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; modern as it just does not have the refinement of shape that we\n&gt; expect to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; see in Japanese workmanship. So the blade may be old, but if it\n&gt; does not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; have a clear and distinguishable hamon it is nonetheless a &quot;junk&quot;\n&gt; piece.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Barry Thomas\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (Melbourne, Australia)\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ----- Original Message -----\n&gt; &gt; &gt; From: Patrik Danielsson\n&gt; &gt; &gt; To: nihontostudy@ &lt;mailto:nihontostudy%40yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sent: Thursday, November 27, 2008 8:27 AM\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: [nihontostudy] Question about a small Tanto or??\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hello everybody, i bought this small &quot;tanto&quot; on an ad here in Sweden.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Its feel really genunine, some kind of hard wood whith nice\n&gt; graining in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; saya\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and tsuka, on some places it looks like all the brass has been\n&gt; &gt; &gt; silverplated\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (can still se it above tha habaki on one of the photos), i have\n&gt; not been\n&gt; &gt; &gt; able to take the tsuka of it yet,but i gonna do that,(depending of the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; answers here :-)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Can this be a &quot;tourist&quot; thing , or is it made for a child , women or\n&gt; &gt; &gt; something like that?, if someone have some info age or something i\n&gt; will\n&gt; &gt; &gt; really happy.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The blade from grip (above habaki) to tip is 6.5 inches / 17 cm,\n&gt; and the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; total is 10 inches/ 25.5 cm.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Here is some pictures of it:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; http://s74.photobuc\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;http://s74.photobucket.com/albums/i248/wellcraftantiqua/japan/ \n&gt; &lt;http://s74.photobucket.com/albums/i248/wellcraftantiqua/japan/&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ket.com/albums/i248/wellcraftantiqua/japan/\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks alot\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Patrik\n&gt; &gt; &gt; .\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ----------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; No virus found in this incoming message.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Checked by AVG.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Version: 7.5.549 / Virus Database: 270.9.10/1814 - Release Date:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 2008-11-26\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 20:53\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
