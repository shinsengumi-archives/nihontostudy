It is in polish, Tokubetsu Hozon, ubu, shirasaya, nice. Avoiding Ebay, he has asked that I place a link to the some pictures of the sword to our groups. \n\nHere it is: www.nethumidors.com/sword.htm   (If link doesn&#39;t work, just type it is.)\n\nI&#39;m very familiar with this sword and agree, it is a nice, exuberant example of Yukihiro&#39;s work. Why do I not buy it myself? Hmmm...if you saw my sword debts at the moment, you wouldn&#39;t ask that question. It would be nice to keep this excellent sword &quot;in the St. Louis family&quot; but sometimes that&#39;s impossible. Please, contact Dave direct. His email and all other pertinent is posted through this link to the photos. If you have any problems with the photos (can&#39;t see why, but...), Dave&#39;s email is: davidballew@.... Feel safe; Dave&#39;s a good guy.\n\nRon\nSTL\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
