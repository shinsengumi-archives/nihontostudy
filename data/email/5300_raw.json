There aren&#39;t different attributions for the different parts of the\n  Edo period. The NTHK does assign a period within Edo for every fitting or\n  koshirae paper:\n\n  \u001b$B=i4|\u001b(B Shoki (the beginning)\n\n  \u001b$BA04|\u001b(B Zenki (the first part)\n\n  \u001b$BCf4|\u001b(B Chuki (the middle)\n\n  \u001b$B8e4|\u001b(B Koki (late)\n\n  \u001b$BKv4|\u001b(B Baki (the end)\n\n  The NBTHK does not.\n\n  I can&#39;t even guess at a group on the tombo menuki, and that is the way it is\n  with the Kyo-kinko attribution. I didn&#39;t see them in Tampa, but based on the\n  photos they look like late Edo work.\n\n  Agreed with Gordon&#39;s earlier comment that there are plenty of early solid\n  gold menuki, including Ko-mino and Ko-Kinko work in addition to Goto. The\n  recent NBTHK AB display and lecture at Tampa included several pairs of solid\n  gold mainline Goto menuki from the Muromachi and early Edo periods.\n\n  Jim\n\n  ----- Original Message -----\n  From: Ron Hartmann\n  To: nihontostudy@ &lt;mailto:nihontostudy%40yahoogroups.com&gt; yahoogroups.com\n  Sent: Wednesday, February 27, 2008 7:31 PM\n  Subject: Re: [nihontostudy] Kyo-kinko\n\n  Jim -\n\n  You may have seen these in Tampa but here is a link showing the menuki that\n  I was asking about:\n  http://www.nihonto. &lt;http://www.nihonto.com/11.3.07.html&gt; com/11.3.07.html\n\n  Papered as Kyo-kinko, maybe these fall into that area as you mentioned where\n  it is difficult to &quot;date&quot; them or to assign a maker.

It is often applied to work that is in Goto style but is not Goto\n  main or sideline work. Edo-kinko used to be used similarly for work in the\n  style of Edo region machibori kinko schools, but lately this is generally\n  lumped as &quot;Kyo-kinko&quot; as well. So it truly is a grab bag, but the problem\n  (especially with menuki) is that there is so much Edo period kinko work with\n  no unique character to it that makes it possible to give a more specific\n  attribution.\n\n  BTW, generic Edo period kinko work of lower quality than Kyo-kinko is\n  attributed to Kyo-kanagushi.\n\n  Jim\n\n  ----- Original Message -----\n  From: ROBSON Gordon\n  To: nihontostudy@ &lt;mailto:nihontostudy%40yahoogroups.com&gt; yahoogroups.com\n  Sent: Wednesday, February 27, 2008 4:23 PM\n  Subject: Re: [nihontostudy] Kyo-kinko\n\n  Hi Ron,\n\n  My understanding is that Kyo-Kinko is the new name for Waki-Goto. This would\n\n  make them a grab bag like Ko-Kinko or even Shoami. Their dates are post-Ko-\n  Kinko, so early Edo to Bakumatsu. There is a Kyo-Kinko book out there. I\n  think the\n  title is Kyo-Kinko no Kenkyu (research into Kyo-Kinko) or something like\n  that. Jim\n  is probably better up on this stuff then I am.\n\n  On on different note, good luck to Harry.
