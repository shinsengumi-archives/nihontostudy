As polishing plays a=\r\n vital  \n &gt; role in determining the sword&#39;s final shape and appearance, an =\r\n \n &gt; understanding of the polisher&#39;s art is essential for anyone  \n &gt; inter=\r\nested in this unique weapon.\n &gt; =E2=80=94FROM CHAPTER ONE\n &gt;\n &gt;\n &gt; To under=\r\nstand Japanese sword polishing is to understand the  \n &gt; Japanese sword. Do=\r\nwn through the years, the great sword  \n &gt; connoisseurs in Japan have been =\r\nsword polishers. A swordsmith can  \n &gt; spend a large amount of time forging=\r\n a classic sword, but refining  \n &gt; and bringing out its final shape, color=\r\n, and texture so that all  \n &gt; the details of the steel and hamon (the temp=\r\ner line) are clearly  \n &gt; visible is the responsibility of another craftsma=\r\nn\n &gt; =E2=80=94the sword polisher.\n &gt;\n &gt; The Art of Japanese Sword Polishing=\r\n is the first book in English to  \n &gt; examine in great detail the polisher&#39;=\r\ns techniques, for which they  \n &gt; may apprentice for as long as ten years. =\r\nIt illustrates the  \n &gt; methods, materials, and tools used for this process=\r\n. But the book&#39;s  \n &gt; true aim is to bring to readers an appreciation of th=\r\ne beauty of a  \n &gt; well-crafted Japanese sword. As readers learn both how t=\r\nhe sword  \n &gt; polisher enhances the beauty of a blade and how he handles th=\r\ne  \n &gt; problems of coaxing out its finest qualities through his polishing  =\r\n\n &gt; techniques, they will come to a higher understanding of the fine  \n &gt; a=\r\nrt of making a Japanese sword, and be able to view, purchase, or  \n &gt; colle=\r\nct swords with greater pleasure.\n &gt;\n &gt;\n &gt;\n &gt;\n &gt;\n \n \n \n [Non-text portions o=\r\nf this message have been removed]\n \n             \n\n        SPONSORED LINKS =\r\n  \n                                                    Buy fine art        =\r\n                               Japanese translation                        =\r\n               Japanese incense                                            =\r\n                         Fine art inkjet paper                             =\r\n          Fine art printing                                       Fine art =\r\nappraisal                                                                 \n=\r\n      \n---------------------------------\n   YAHOO!
