It allowed me to get a message sent to\nthe warehouse manager that started the search that immediately turned up\nthe sword.\n\nThis identical problem happened to me one year ago in Montreal, with the\nsame situation... someone removed a sword from the stream, scanned that\nit was sent to Customs, then it was put aside in someone&#39;s office where\nat the end of three weeks of phone calls and searching it was later\n&quot;found&quot; 15 minutes after I said I was sending the police.\n\nNeedless to say it is Fedex only for me here on in, and I could myself\nlucky to have gotten both pieces back.\n\nThanks go to a lot of you who sent me supportive notes. I was pretty\ndeep in despair there due to the value and importance of the\npiece. Those notes helped me make it through, so thanks.\n\n- darcy\n\n\n\n\n\n"
