For those unfamiliar with our annual KTK (Kokusai Tosogu Kai) publication, these are high quality printed hard-cover (with slip cover) books showing photographs with descriptions of high quality fittings (the best) selected from members&#39; collections. The KTK is a small private international club of tosogu collectors. Members fund these publications as as a means of supporting our organization (there are no dues) while sharing knowledge of fine tosogu. Each member is expected to buy (10) copies of these limited printings (usually 400 copies) while others will buy twenty or thirty copies and resell them. Myself, I&#39;ve been charging $90 pp to U.S. addresses which is, considering the cost of the photography and final printing, plus shipping. Some members do not even try to break even; myself, I prefer to not particularly take a loss, but that&#39;s just me. Anyway, that&#39;s a little background on these KTK publications. The 2010 edition is already being worked on and will be bigger and better than before, from preliminary indications. Feel free to contact me privately at: swords@... if interested in buying a copy. Those outside of the U.S.A. can buy them cheaper (because of shipping costs) from local members. \n\nRon\nSTL\n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: Andres Pedraza \nTo: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \nSent: Monday, May 03, 2010 7:33 PM\nSubject: [nihontostudy] Re: [nihonto] Chicago chit-chat anyone?\n\nI&#39;ll plug his KTK books, they&#39;re worth every penny.\n\nBest,\n\nAndres\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
