However, this residual \ncompressive stress is enhanced by the relative expansion of the \nmartensitic ha as compared to the ferritic/pearlitic core, but is not \nfundamentally caused by it.  Due to the much more rapid cooling of \nthe ha, there would be a residual compressive stress left in it even \nwere there no phase transformations at all, such as in a uniform \naustenitic nickel steel.  I am dubious, however, as to how much this \nresidual compressive stress adds to the longevity of the ha in battle \nuse.  Imagine the brittle ha under compression like a string of, say, \n20 child&#39;s wooden blocks squeezed between your hands.  Push really \nhard!  Now have someone tap the middle block from one side, and watch \nthe blocks spray out.  And so I&#39;ve seen nihonto with big chips blown \nout of the ha, perhaps likewise ejected by an off-center, sideways \nstrike to the ha by something hard.  In any event, I don&#39;t think any \nof the following has any effect on the &quot;flexibility&quot; issue, the \nelastic bending of the sword below the yield stress or brittle \nfracture stress.  Again, &quot;flexibility&quot; of an iron/steel sword does \nnot depend on carbon/alloy content or heat treatment.  Not intuitive \nat all to me.\n\nBTW, I obviously forgot which list I was on in a previous reply, and \nso apologize.  Also, the elastic modulus (Young&#39;s modulus) is, of \ncourse, the ratio of the stress to the strain, not the reverse as I \nerroneously said before.  If you maintain the units, any error \nbecomes obvious.  That is why physicists rarely have a problem, \nwhereas engineers tend to get into trouble, crashing space probes \ninto planets and whatnot.  ;o)\n\nNC\n\n\n"
