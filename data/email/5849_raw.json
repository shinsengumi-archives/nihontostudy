Reality is somewhat different with \nearly=\r\n Akasaka guards showing an inconsistent variety of forging schemes \nand lay=\r\nering.\n\nI&#39;ve never run across any particular story or \nreality with the for=\r\nging of Owari guards. The good ones I&#39;ve handled are \nquite tightly welded.=\r\n  Visible layers in a guard are often the result \nof rust or fire. Voids in=\r\n the outer rim like that are rather suspect - I \ndoubt that guards were let=\r\n out of the shop like that. But, it looks \nlike it&#39;s in good condition othe=\r\nrwise, so who knows.\n\nRegarding the reference to an &quot;Owari&quot; guard in a KTK =\r\ncatalog...  I would approach \nthose books with caution as reference materia=\r\nl.\n\nJim\n\nVisit Midway Atoll? \n\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/jggilbert/sets/=\r\n72157626224419365/\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\n\nFrom: Ron Hartmann \n\nSent:=\r\n Jul 14, 2011 1:19 PM\n\nTo: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com\n\nSubject: Re: [niho=\r\nntostudy] Owari sukashi tsuba\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n    \n      \n     =\r\n \n      Beautiful tsuba!

Fairly classic design and at 81mm x 80mm x 5.5mm it \n\n  is a nice=\r\n size. One of the traits here that I find most interesting is \n\n  the mimi,=\r\n and the obvious fold line that appears in it (it covers about \n\n  30% of t=\r\nhe mimi). it is almost like the tsuba was made from a two plate \n\n  constru=\r\nction, though I am not suggesting that at all. I assume the \n\n  original pl=\r\nate was forged, then folded and forged again before shaping.\n\n\n\nI cannot na=\r\ny that I have seen this so clearly before in an Owari guard \n\n  before ( I =\r\nwill also note that I got it to jump out a bit with some \n\n  clever lightin=\r\ng etc) and wondered if it was a normal trait in Owari works.\n\n\n\nI really lo=\r\nve the iron on this guard, its been well forged and is in \n\n  really good c=\r\nondition.\n\n\n\nhttp://farm7.static.flickr.com/6144/5934784209_807a0a2719_b.jp=\r\ng\n\n\n\nhttp://farm7.static.flickr.com/6132/5934784543_7aa87f9b4a_b.jpg\n\n\n\nhtt=\r\np://farm7.static.flickr.com/6144/5935345246_1aa21c6a64_b.jpg\n\n\n\nCheers\n\n\n\nR=\r\nich\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n[Non-text p=\r\nortions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n     \n\n    \n    \n\n"
