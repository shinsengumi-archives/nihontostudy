My guess would be that it is Shoami, and \nmost probably, Kyo Shoami. Nice floral these, we can&#39;t tell a lot about \nthe iron due to the colour of your photo&#39;s unfortunately but if in good \ncondition without cracks or serous damage, then this sort of thing might \nsell on Ebay for between $300 - $400.00\n\nJim&#39;s site has a section on Shoami tsuba I believe.\n\nCheers\n\nRichard\n\npetter992000 wrote:\n\n&gt;Hi all.\n&gt;\n&gt;I found this group via the excellent http://home.earthlink.net/\n&gt;~jggilbert/tsuba.htm and I was hoping you could tell me a bit about my \n&gt;first tsuba. A relative picked it up at a flea market, hoping to mount \n&gt;it on a drawer, but now it&#39;s mine :-).\n&gt;\n&gt;I&#39;ve looked through the above site, but I&#39;m having trouble both dating \n&gt;it and determining the style. I know the leaves and flower are \n&gt;chrysanthemum, but that&#39;s about it. It&#39;s 85 mm (3.35 in) in diameter \n&gt;and weighs 96 gram (3.39 oz). I can&#39;t find any characters engraved on \n&gt;either side or the rim. I&#39;m guessing it&#39;s made of iron with patches of \n&gt;gold leaf.\n&gt;\n&gt;The link to the front is http://tinyurl.com/d9fvq and to the back is \n&gt;http://tinyurl.com/b6643 . My lack of photography skills is legendary, \n&gt; so please ignore the level differences and let me know if better \n&gt;pictures are required.\n&gt;\n&gt;I doubt there&#39;s much market in my area for this type of item and I&#39;m \n&gt;definitely keeping it for the novelty, but I&#39;d be curious to know if \n&gt;it&#39;s worth 50 cents or 5 dollars.\n&gt;\n&gt;That&#39;s all for now, thanks in advance for any comments.\n&gt;\n&gt;Petter\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;Yahoo!
