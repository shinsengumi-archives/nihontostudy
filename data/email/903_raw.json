Hozon papers. Granted he is not giving it\naway, but the big &quot;name&quot; dealers would certainly not charge less than\nthis in my opinion (infact probably at least a couple of thousand\nmore..............), and it has provenance (where the seller purchased\nit). It is not one of those &quot;finds&quot; which usually turn out to be alot\nless grand than stated by the seller. \n \nAnyway it doesn&#39;t make much difference to me as I can&#39;t afford it at the\nmoment, but if I could I would seriously consider it. I believe Robert\nreferred to this blade earlier as having an &quot;etched&quot; design ? No such\nthing, this is a genuine piece of art. Not some piece of Chinese\nrubbish. \n \nAnd ofcourse anything koto Soshu den is going to cost you an arm and a\nleg. There seem to be more collectors in that area, generally driving\nprices up. \n \nWell I believe I have said enough now considering I still know nothing\nin the big scheme of things hahahahahah. Anyone who wants to put their\nfoot in my mouth, feel most welcome. \n \nMatt \n\n-----Oorspronkelijk bericht-----\nVan: Doug E.
