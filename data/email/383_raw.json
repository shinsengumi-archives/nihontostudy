Yes, I guess it would be a fukurin. It was quite \nwide, not unlike the wide rim of a sukashi tsuba,  dont think ( only \nguessing ) this would have been added later on as it seemed too well \ndesigned and fitted, it looked to much, part of the tsuba. If I can \nremember, I will scan a frame of the vid next week at work and post a \npic so we can see.\n\nthanks for the info\n\ncheers\n\nRichard\n\nJim Gilbert wrote:\n\n&gt; Richard,\n&gt; I haven&#39;t seen the video, are you describing a fukurin (rim cover)?  \n&gt; One characteristic of Hirata Hikozo&#39;s fukurin is that they turn freely \n&gt; on the guard.  His are original to the plate and were put there for \n&gt; aesthetic reasons.  Most fukurin do not turn freely like that.  \n&gt; Sometimes fukurin were added when the mimi was damaged and/or the \n&gt; plate was reduced in diameter.  I suppose that&#39;s also for aesthetics. \n&gt;\n&gt; The only functional reasons for a fukurin that I can think of would be \n&gt; to keep a rough rim from catching on clothing or to protect the tsuba \n&gt; from wear (if you were really fussy about preserving your tsuba).  Of \n&gt; course for multi-layer construction a fukurin is sometimes used to \n&gt; mechanically hold the plates together and to cover what would \n&gt; otherwise be a pretty unattractive rim. \n&gt;\n&gt; Sometimes you find plates that have had a fukurin removed, but you can \n&gt; still see a ring left on the surface where it was applied.  One method \n&gt; of attaching a fukurin involved cutting a small rectangular notch in \n&gt; the mimi (usually at the &quot;6 o&#39;clock&quot; position), and sometimes you&#39;ll \n&gt; see this on a piece that has lost the rim cover.\n&gt;\n&gt; Jim\n\n\n\n\n"
