According to Shinto legend, the kami of Kashima Jinja (in modern Ibaraki Prefecture) and Katori Jinja (in Chiba Prefecture), were summoned by the head of the Fujiwara clan, and arrived riding on white deer for installation in the new shrine.  The notion of deer serving as means of passage for divinities to the world of men enters into Shinto from Taoism.  In Taoist belief, deer are the only animal able to locate the sacred Fungus of Immortality [reishi, mannendake] and live to an exceptionally old age.  Deer are, therefore, the messengers of the gods of immortality, Furukokuju and Jurojin.  By the 17th century, the antlers of the resident deer were deemed hazardous to the crowds of visitors to the temple and shrine, and the ceremonial cutting of the antlers (Shika-no-Tsunkiri) became an annual October event.  The combination of deer antler and maple is a wonderful example of the allusive seasonal imagery beloved in Japan.&quot;\n\n\n\nwhen I finally obtained a copy of the 5th Haynes Auction Catalogue from the 1980s.  Mr. Haynes listed an almost identical tsuba, I would say clearly from the same hand, stating that these were symbols of the battles between Takeda Shingen and Uesugi Kenshin.  So I was trying to pursue that lead. \n\nThanks,\nDavid \n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: Dr John P Lissenden \n  To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Wednesday, April 13, 2005 8:38 AM\n  Subject: [nihontostudy] Re: Takeda Shingen & Uetsugi Kenshin symbolism\n\n\n\n  Dear David\n\n  This is not really an answer to your query but Edmunds, in \n  his &#39;Pointers and Clues to the Subjects of Chinese and Japanese Art&#39;, \n  describes The Maple with deer as being the emblem of autumn.\n\n  Regards, John L.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  --- In nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com, &quot;David Zincavage&quot; &lt;jdz@i...&gt; \n  wrote:\n  &gt;       Can anybody explain how maple leaves & deer antler would \n  symbolize the battles of the above fellows?
