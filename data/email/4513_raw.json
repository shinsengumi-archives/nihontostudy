I would like to find=\r\n\nout as much information as I can about it, I suspect it may be a WWII\nera =\r\nofficer&#39;s weapon or it may be older than that. The blade polish\nhas been co=\r\nmpletely destroyed, and the edge has been dulled. The tsuba\nis tarnished an=\r\nd much of the silver/gold decoration is missing. What I\nknow about it:\n\nThe=\r\n blade is between 16-17 inches from end of tang to tip. It is\ncurved, but t=\r\nhe handle is nearly straight. The handle itself has been\nre-wrapped and re-=\r\ncovered with rayskin, and two spacers have been\nadded between the Habaki an=\r\nd the tsuba, and the tsuba and the handle\ncollar. These are not original, t=\r\nhey look like they were taken from a\nmuch larger weapon. There is no idicat=\r\nion of a hamon. The Habaki looks\noriginal and is copper, polished on top wi=\r\nth diagonal file marks at\nthe bottom and on the sides. \n\nThe handle collar =\r\nis copper and is marked with three symbols, two\ncharacters and a &quot;flower&quot; t=\r\nhat is composed of a central circle and\nthree semi-circular lobes. The hand=\r\nle cap is horn, and is original by\nmy information. \n\nThere are characters c=\r\nhisled into the tang, I attempted to take a\nrubbing but it wasn&#39;t successfu=\r\nl. They are only one one side, but the\nreverse side has two small triangula=\r\nr notches near the top of the tang.\n\nI realize that no one would be able to=\r\n tell much from the words, but\nmaybe someone can inform me on how to best r=\r\necord and display the\nneeded markings/information that would allow identifi=\r\ncation or any\nother information to be determined. \n\nThanks in advance.\n\n\n\n"
