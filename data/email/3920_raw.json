The $10000 sword \nwas an=\r\n example only. For me to get something from Japan, I already \nhave 6 or 7% =\r\nduty plus 7% GST now if I went through a middleman \nanother 8% plus. This w=\r\nould seem innocuous on small purchases but it \nadds up. If I could get 8% o=\r\nn purchases dealing in millions per year \n(potentially) and on top of that =\r\ninternal shipping is paid and \nexternal shipping is added plus the handling=\r\n fee of $10 to pay my \nstaff, the 8% is gravy and I would be rich for doing=\r\n nothing. The \n15% you say some charge is just usurious. Maybe I&#39;m cheap bu=\r\nt that \nis a good gaff. John                                               =\r\n -\n-- In nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com, Richard Turner &lt;ikkanshi@...&gt; \nwrote=\r\n:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi John, actually, 8% is not bad, I know of dealers and buyers in \nJa=\r\npan \n&gt; who charge 15% and get good custom. The 1000JY fee is for internal \n=\r\n&gt; shipping with in Japan. The issue is, many sellers in Japan won&#39;t \nship \n=\r\n&gt; internationally. They don&#39;t want the bother, and they don&#39;t pack \nitems \n=\r\n&gt; to ship out of the country. The intermediate buyer should handle \nall \n&gt; =\r\nthat very well. Mine does.\n&gt; \n&gt; Of course everything is a risk and dropping=\r\n 10K on a sword in an \nonline \n&gt; auction is pretty risky anyway unless you =\r\nreally know what you are \n&gt; doing. There&#39;s a lot to be said for holding som=\r\nething in the hand.\n&gt; \n&gt; Rich\n&gt; \n&gt; excelsiorilluminati wrote:\n&gt; &gt;  Hello Ni=\r\nchido, 8% on top of all the other fees does not seem \ncheap \n&gt; &gt; to me. If =\r\nI was to buy a $10000 sword you get $800 dollars just \nto \n&gt; &gt; redirect it =\r\nto me from a seller who could send it direct. Plus  \n1000 \n&gt; &gt; yen to have =\r\nit delivered to you and the 1000 yen for who knows \nwhat. \n&gt; &gt; What would b=\r\ne the benefit?
