I hear the show was once again a sel=\r\nl-out show with loads of goodies to fondle at all the tables. \n\nWhat I enjo=\r\nyed so very much was the talks and exhibits that were presented. Gordon Rob=\r\nson (NTHK) presented an interesting exhibit and talk on swords and fittings=\r\n from Mino province which was quite educational. Then there was a wonderful=\r\n exhibit presented by Bob Benson and the NBTHK-American branch on &quot;tanto.&quot; =\r\nAround twenty fine tanto were laid out for our study showing the changes in=\r\n form and treatment over the centuries. This was quite educational, to see =\r\nKamakura work and then Muromachi and later, Muromachi copies of Kamakura wo=\r\nrks. \n\nThen there was a super exhibit of fittings entitled &quot;Machibori&quot; whic=\r\nh was assembled and presented by Mike Yamasaki. Unbelievable quality of fit=\r\ntings were represented! As Mike pointed out, the name &quot;Machibori&quot; is taken =\r\n(outside of Japan) as more common &quot;street carver&#39;s work&quot; when in reality, i=\r\nt does not mean &quot;lower quality&quot; work at all. The items exhibited and explai=\r\nned in Mikes illustrated catalogue (in color) were super in quality and car=\r\nried many famous names. \n\nThe NBTHK-American branch also held a kantei sess=\r\nion for members laying out four blades for our judgment, always a challenge=\r\n!!!\n\nIt was simply a great weekend. Saturday&#39;s banquet for tableholders was=\r\n yummy and appreciated, judging from the overflowing plates some guys carri=\r\ned away. The unfortunate part of the weekend was that the hotel was under c=\r\nonstruction as they remodeled the lobby bar/first floor area. It was a mess=\r\n!!! However, everyone adapted quickly and the temporary bar area (in the ca=\r\nsual restaurant area) was full of merrymakers at the end of the evening aft=\r\ner the show closed at ten. Fun times!\n\nRon\nSTL\n  ----- Original Message ---=\r\n-- \n  From: Elliott \n  To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Sunday, Au=\r\ngust 19, 2007 6:37 PM\n  Subject: [nihontostudy] SF Token Kai\n\n\n  I missed t=\r\nhe SF show and feel really bad.
