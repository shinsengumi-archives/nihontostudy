I&#39;ll look \ninto it. I am a &quot;practitioner&quot;, although the weapon I mostly train \nwith is the katana. Nonetheless, I started training with naginata, \ntoo, about, oh, 3 years ago. I&#39;m still a rank beginner, but I&#39;m very \nmuch interested in it as a weapon. I also started training in Yari \naround the same time. But while I practice and learn katana waza \nweekly, or sometimes more often, I do naginata and yari maybe once a month.\n\nBest Regards,\n\nAndres\n\nAt 07:54 AM 12/8/2006, you wrote:\n&gt;Hi Andres,\n&gt;                       Nice to see someone else out there interested in these\n&gt;wonderful polearms. Knutsen&#39;s book is one of the only ones in english that I\n&gt;am aware of. Are you a &quot;practitioner&quot; of Naginata or simply looking to study\n&gt;them?\n&gt;Another book you may want to look at is; Naginata - The Definitive Guide by\n&gt;Dr. Alexander Bennett.  It is only available through;\n&gt;HYPERLINK &quot;http://www.kendo-world.com&quot;www.kendo-world.com     A warning\n&gt;though; the suppliers have a &quot;reputation&quot; for being slow with their orders.\n&gt;I placed an order 2 weeks ago and there hasn&#39;t been any movement on my\n&gt;credit card or even an e-mail confirmation of my request.  Expect a wait of\n&gt;3-4 months! With that said, the book comes with some glowing reviews since\n&gt;anything on the subject in english is so rare. During the historical\n&gt;developement of Japan, it&#39;s amazing to see that the Katana took a backseat\n&gt;to the Bow and Naginata.\n&gt;\n&gt;Mark\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;-----Original Message-----\n&gt;From: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com [mailto:nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com]On\n&gt;Behalf Of Andres Pedraza\n&gt;Sent: Thursday, December 07, 2006 8:43 PM\n&gt;To: nihonto@yahoogroups.com; nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;Subject: [nihontostudy] Yari and Naginata\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Nihonto People,\n&gt;\n&gt;I haven&#39;t seen a whole lot of books on Yari and/or Naginata in\n&gt;English, so even though it was a bit pricy, I purchased Roald and\n&gt;Susan Knutsen&#39;s book ( HYPERLINK\n&gt;&quot;http://tinyurl.com/yxlhuj&quot;http://tinyurl.-com/yxlhuj). I just finished it.\n&gt;I am very impressed and sorry I did not purchase it earlier. The\n&gt;concise yet informative text plus the wealth of drawings and plates\n&gt;was well worth the price.\n&gt;\n&gt;If there&#39;s anyone else out there interested in the subject and that\n&gt;has been on the fence about this great book because of the price tag,\n&gt;well, stop considering it and buy it. Give it to yourself for\n&gt;Christmas. You won&#39;t regret it.\n&gt;\n&gt;And if Roald and Susan subscribe to these lists (or someone who knows\n&gt;them does) please receive a big thank you from me... This book will\n&gt;be a permanent part of my reference library.\n&gt;\n&gt;Anyone have any other books on Yari and/or Naginata they want to\n&gt;recommend? I&#39;m thirsty for more knowledge now.\n&gt;\n&gt;Thanks!\n&gt;\n&gt;Andres\n&gt;\n&gt;[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;--\n&gt;No virus found in this incoming message.\n&gt;Checked by AVG Free Edition.\n&gt;Version: 7.1.409 / Virus Database: 268.15.14/578 - Release Date: 12/7/2006\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;--\n&gt;No virus found in this outgoing message.\n&gt;Checked by AVG Free Edition.\n&gt;Version: 7.1.409 / Virus Database: 268.15.15/579 - Release Date: 12/7/2006\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Yahoo!
