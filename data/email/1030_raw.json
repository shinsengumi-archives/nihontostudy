(Same=\r\n thing that happened before.)  \n\n  Is this the tsuba labeled Akasaka-1 & 2 =\r\nin your folder (&quot;Sashimono in negative silhouette and clouds in positive si=\r\nlhouette&quot;)?  \n\n  4 mm would be unusually thin for early Akasaka.  The late =\r\nguards can be that thin.\n  Jim \n\n\n\n    Hi all, I picked this Akasaka tsuba =\r\nup some time ago. It was sold to me as Sh=F4ami I think from memory. I  per=\r\nsonally believed it to be from around the 6th or 7th Gen Akasaka line, thou=\r\ngh unsure who in that line may have made it.\n\n    A few months back I took =\r\nit to a trip to Melbourne and showed it to some friends and our local Kod=\r\n=F4gu expert there believed it was early Akasaka, maybe around the time of =\r\nthe 2 - 4th gen.\n\n    It is Wak sized and about 4mm thick.
