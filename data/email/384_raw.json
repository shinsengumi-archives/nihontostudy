It was \nsuggested that they may have been made for women&#39;s wedding presents or \nsome such thing, and I think it was suggested that blades offered to \nwomen as presents was a Meiji or there abouts practice.\n\nI would have thought a small blade would be easy to conceal and \ntherefore perfect for any clandestin action. I am wondering if these \nvery small blades ( 15 cm or there abouts ) were common to any \nparticular era. I wouldn&#39;t have thought they would be useful as \nyorio-doshi as they would be too short, though they all seem to be quite \nwide so I thought they may have not been Koto. So I guess that leaves \nShinto and on.\n\nAny thoughts on this.\n\nCheers all\n\nRichard\n\n\n"
