Works of art will be screened &quot;at a level of security commensurate to that of passenger baggage&quot;, in other words everything will be unpacked and handled. There is no guarantee that the inspectors will have any training in handling works of art.\n\n  US Shippers can apply for Certified Cargo Screening Facility (CCSF) which would allow their cargo direct access to a passenger air carrier, but it is not clear whether cargo shipped this way would or would not be subject to individual inspection at airports if the authorities requested it.\n\n  I think the inspectors for each shipment should be identified so we will know whose fingerprints are on the blade.\n\n  Alan\n\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n  __________ Information from ESET NOD32 Antivirus, version of virus signature database 4909 (20100302) __________\n\n  The message was checked by ESET NOD32 Antivirus.\n\n  http://www.eset.com\n\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n  \n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
