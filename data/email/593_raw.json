The wood costs me nothing as\nmost often I pull it out of the scrap bin (you&#39;d be\namazed what people will throw away) and the time it\ntakes me to build one well that&#39;s just wasted time\nbetween when I get off work and when the wifey gets\nhome. Besides I need a reason to get off my butt and\nget back into the woodshop. I have so many projects on\nthe back burner but no real motivation to go and get\nstarted on them. So if any of you out there would be\ninterested in a custom box just get a photo copy of a\nTsuba you want it for and mail it to me. I ask for a\nphoto copy and not a digital picture because I need a\n1:1 copy to work from. I&#39;m not going to ask anything\nbut shipping for the box&#39;s at least for now because\nthere is no timetable for completion of them. When I\nstart doing them to turn a profit THEN I&#39;ll start\ncharging for labor. But for right now I just want to\nuse my woodworking skills before I lose them.\n\nBob R\n\nP.S. Tsuba bags are easy just get yourself some\npliable felt cut it about an 8th of an inch wider than\nthe Tsuba on either side and 3 times the length. Fold\nthe tsuba up with the felt and sew up two sides. This\nshould give you a flap that you can either sew velcro\nonto it or get some silk string to tie the bag shut.\n\n=====\nCheck out &quot;Cowboy&quot; Bob&#39;s Books & Things at:\nhttp://asia.geocities.com/gentleman9/index.html\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nSBC Yahoo!
