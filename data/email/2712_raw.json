As far as pictures go, what do you have to work with in the \nway of camera/lighting?  there\nare a number of techniques, not all of which are applicable to all \ncameras...  Also, what are\nyou trying to capture?  The activities in the hada/ha, the overall shape \nof the blade with the mune &quot;lit up&quot;\nand the hamon line visible, closeups of the grain structure, pictures \nwith the nie/nioi &quot;lit up&quot;, or...?\n\nA great place to start is to read Darcy&#39;s write up on nihonto.ca - have \nyou read this?\n\nLately I&#39;ve been experimenting with just using one big light and \nblocking/reflecting light as needed - this seems\nto work pretty well - I place the light at the end of the nakago shining \nalong the blade to light up stuff, and then I use\nwhite cards to illuminate the back and kissaki - I also either use \nfilters or simply block the light shining on the nakago and\nthen use a white card to put some back (or a less dense nd filter \nbetween the nakago and the light and no reflector card...).\nhere&#39;s a typical result:\n\nhttp://home.teleport.com/~rkg/photos/kaneyoshi_korekane_tanto.jpg\n\nhere&#39;s a hada shot:\nhttp://home.teleport.com/~rkg/photos/sukesada_boshi.jpg\n\nand a nasty hamon shot:\nhttp://home.teleport.com/~rkg/photos/ubu_nag_hada.jpg\n\nhere&#39;s one of my earlier attempts trying to use multiple lights\nhttp://home.teleport.com/~rkg/photos/yasu_front.jpg\n\nI don&#39;t seem to have any glowing hamon/activity shots on my computer at \nthe moment - sorry...\n\n\nfor getting pictures of hada/hamon structures, you can shoot straight on \n(TURN OFF THE FLASH!!!) with a light to either side coming in\nat a steep angle (or the beforementioned one side), and to get glowing \nnie/nioi you really need to do the same thing you\ndo when looking at it (camera at an angle to the sword, light at an angle).\n\nAlso, don&#39;t be afraid to use a really high f/stop to get more depth of \nfield (using a wider lens gets you more DOF as\nwell, but that can cause other problems if you go too wide) - just put \nthe camera on a tripod (use the shutter lockup\nif you have it) and go for it - maximum &quot;sharpness&quot; might be at f/8, but \nusually you&#39;re beyond the resolution of the system\nthat cranking on over to f/16 or tighter will result in no visable \ndegradation...\n\nThe other thing to remember is that swords are effectively complex \nmirrors - I tend to surround the sword with white/black\ncards (sheets of foamboard) filling up the angles that would reflect \ninto the lens (I also have a big black sheet and a stand to\nblock stray reflections from ceilings, walls, etc., but that&#39;s another \nstory....).\n\nA good dissertation on lighting stuff is in a book called &quot;color, light, \nand magic&quot; (can&#39;t remember the author at the moment) .\n\nGotta run, Good Luck,\n\nrkg\n(Richard George)\n\n&gt;Hey all,\n&gt;\n&gt;I&#39;m pretty new to this subject and to this group. Can anyone give me some \n&gt;help as to how to photograph swords in a way that shows the detail. I have \n&gt;been at it a while now with very limited success.\n&gt;\n&gt;Best regards to all\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;Yahoo!
