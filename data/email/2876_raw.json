When I said Kaga and the Yoshiro, I meant Kaga Yoshiro and the\nYoshiro of Kyoto area. (I think that&#39;s right, right?)\n&gt;\n&gt; When thinking Kaga Yoshiro, I&#39;ve had the impression that more often they\nwould have squarish-type hitsuana; these are conventional shape with the\nkogai histsu being very &quot;rounded/drilled-like&quot; as you see on many of the\nKyo-sukashi tsuba. That was my thinking here. Not sure why, but I also\nthought Kaga Yoshiro tsuba were more of a thinner plate than the others, but\nI&#39;m not sure where that idea came from.\n&gt;\n&gt; Ron\n&gt; STL\n&gt;\n&gt;   ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt;   From: Alan Bale\n&gt;   To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;   Sent: Saturday, April 23, 2005 3:04 PM\n&gt;   Subject: Re: [nihontostudy] yoshiro school tsuba?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   It looks like Kaga to me, don&#39;t forget that you also divide Yoshiro into\n&gt;   &#39;Kaga Yoshiro&#39; and &#39;Bizen Yoshiro&#39;.\n&gt;\n&gt;   Alan\n&gt;\n&gt;   ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt;   From: &quot;dirk marshall&quot; &lt;dirkmarshall@...&gt;\n&gt;   To: &lt;nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt;   Sent: Saturday, April 23, 2005 7:56 PM\n&gt;   Subject: [nihontostudy] yoshiro school tsuba?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   &gt;\n&gt;   &gt; I bought this with the other and got a good deal as they were rusty.\nI\n&gt;   was wondering if this could be a yoshino or kaga tsuba.
