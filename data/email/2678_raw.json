His conclusion has been=\r\n that the later edition is\nmore complete and accurate and therefore the bet=\r\nter reference.\n\nOf course that still leaves me wondering *which* book it wa=\r\ns that supposedly\nhad many gimei in the first edition ... or if my memory i=\r\ns manufacturing\nthings.\n\nCraig Harris \nwww.bridgeofdreams.com\n\n\n\n"
