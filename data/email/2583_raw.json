The\nblade was buffed and was eventually resold minus the\ntsuba.  I just got this 2nd tsuba the other day.  I am\nattaching the photo, however, if Jim didn&#39;t allow\nattachements I will post it.  I was given attributions\nof either ko shoami or akasaka mid edo.  I know these\naren&#39;t of the highest quality, but I am seeking any\ncomments that can be made about them.  \n\nI don&#39;t neccesarily see the signs of casting that\nnormally are seen, ie bubbles around the seppa dai,\netc.  However, barring the broken antanae (the 1st one\nowned) and the wheel leg they match exactly.  The back\npattern of the mantis appears to have some different\nlow relief detail carving crosshatch vs lines.  I\nthink the one on the left (newest acquisition) might\nneed a really good cleaning which obscures some of it\nplus it has some rust pitting here or there. Any\ncomments on them and or manufacture of them?\n\nhopefully these pics won&#39;t take too long to load, I\njust got high speed wireless internet access and I am\nenjoying extremely fast download seconds!\nThanks,\nKen aka &quot;the mantis dude&quot; \n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?
