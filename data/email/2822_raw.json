But, to be an even wetter blanket, I&#39;m not convinced that it&#39;s Akasaka either.  The Akasaka weren&#39;t the only group to use this design.  The edges of the sukashi show some rounding and beveling, where Akasaka is usually quite sharp and vertical.  The texture of the iron looks a bit softer and grainier than Akasaka.  The shape of the design elements is also softer and looser than typical for Akasaka, compare the details with the signed example in the Sano catalog.  Note also that the seppa dai is wider than that one.  Some things to consider.\n\nJim\n\n\n\n  Hi Ron, a nice observation. and possibly correct. I went right through \n  the Akasaka books and cannot find a single tsuba with the kakushi-tagane \n  though straight lines were used form time to time by the second \n  Tadamasa. Akasaka and Tosa Myochin can at times be very hard to separate \n  I find but it is these little tips that help separate them that make the \n  job just a tad easier.\n\n  I guess one thing is, when in hand, it&#39;s look of age might help. Sasano \n  reports that the Tosa Myochin group started in the mid 1800&#39;s or there \n  abouts. I have a signed Tosa Myochin tsuba signed Toshu ju Kuniyoshi \n  Saku ( shoshin according to Hagihara sensei ) that would date to about \n  1780 - 1800. I know Cary has a Tosa Myochin piece about the same age. I \n  have not heard of them earlier than that, has anyone else ?. I kind of \n  think from the images, this tsuba of mine looks older than the 1800&#39;s, \n  but then again, as I a said, when I have it in hand, it may be easier to \n  tell.\n\n  Anyway, food for thought, I like Tosa Myochin also as a school and would \n  not be upset if it turned out that way.\n\n  best wishes\n\n  Rich\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
