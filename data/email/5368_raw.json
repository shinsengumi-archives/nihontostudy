The 3-leaf sukashi (if that what it is) does re=\r\nsemble \nkiri leaves but I wanted to hear that from somebody else. The stran=\r\nge \npatina is just the quality of the photo...probably a scan. Oddly, \nthat=\r\n off-color shows up the black lacquer, at least I think that&#39;s \nwhat I&#39;m se=\r\neing on the posted view. I find this rather fascinating \nlittle tsuba, my r=\r\neason for seeking some feedback from fresh eyes. \n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m going to send a =\r\ncouple &quot;tests&quot; out after this email. Strange, \nmy nihontostudy email and ya=\r\nhoo email both came back here and was \ndumped into my spam folder. No repli=\r\nes needed for the &quot;test.&quot; \n&gt; \n&gt; Ron\n&gt; STL\n&gt;   ----- Original Message ----- =\r\n\n&gt;   From: excelsiorilluminati \n&gt;   To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n&gt;   S=\r\nent: Wednesday, March 19, 2008 4:22 PM\n&gt;   Subject: [nihontostudy] Re: Tsub=\r\na kantie\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   Hi Ron, A rather strange patina. Looks brassy coloured i=\r\nn areas. \n&gt;   Lighting probably, eh? The sukashi look to be kirimon in shap=\r\ne. \nDon&#39;t \n&gt;   know about the ovals. Nice for a change, from marugata. John=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt;   --- In nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Ron Hartmann&quot; &lt;swords@&gt; \n&gt;   =\r\nwrote:\n&gt;   &gt;\n&gt;   &gt; Hi - \n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; I&#39;m seeking some comments on an inter=\r\nesting old tsuba in my \n&gt;   collection. It is iron sukashi work of a very u=\r\nnusual \n(undescribable, \n&gt;   to me) shape and design. It measures 70mm x 58=\r\nmm x 6mm and has \n&gt;   remnants of black lacquer remaining on it. The hitsu-=\r\nana pillows \nare \n&gt;   interesting in that hey are double-layered, the insid=\r\ne inlay \nbeing \n&gt;   shakudo with a silver overlaid plate. The tsuba has not=\r\n been cut \n&gt;   down so this is its original shape, in my opinion. Obviously=\r\n it \nhas \n&gt;   been refitted many times. A photo is posted in nihontostudy \n=\r\npictures \n&gt;   under Ron STL. (posted under two groups...so one should work =\r\nfor \n&gt;   you.)\n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; http://tinyurl.com/2vyzfc\n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; http://t=\r\ninyurl.com/2z2u8j\n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; Any and all comments welcomed.\n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; =\r\nRon\n&gt;   &gt; STL\n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been rem=\r\noved]\n&gt;   &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;    \n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have bee=\r\nn removed]\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"
