The most appropriate translation for &#39;nihiki \ndesign&#39; wo=\r\nuld perhaps be &#39;two thingys design&#39;!\nRegards, John L.\n\n--- In nihontostudy@=\r\nyahoogroups.com, &quot;Jim Gilbert&quot; &lt;jggilbert@E...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; John,\n&gt; If I am p=\r\nicturing it correctly, the rectangular openings are \nusually interpreted as=\r\n representing measuring boxes (masu).  The \ndesign with two boxes is called=\r\n sayu-masu (left and right boxes).    \n&gt; \n&gt; My Japanese language skills are=\r\n minimal, but I only know of nihiki \nas the &quot;counting word&quot; used for two sm=\r\nall animals. I asked my shodo \nteacher (first native speaker I remembered t=\r\no ask) if she could \nthink of any other meaning for nihiki or a way that it=\r\n might relate \nto that motif, but no luck.  \n&gt; \n&gt; Do you know what the kanj=\r\ni are for that nihiki?  \n&gt; \n&gt; It just occurred to me to try a google image =\r\nsearch on nihiki.  \nMost hits are photos of pairs of dogs, cats, rabbits, e=\r\ntc., but \ninterestingly this jpg http://www005.upp.so-\nnet.ne.jp/minbun/new=\r\ns/news21/nihiki.jpg\n&gt; of a kimono turned up.  Kimono sleeves are normally c=\r\nalled sode as \nfar as I know, but the two rectangular sleeves would fit the=\r\n two \nrectangle motif.  The nihiki  =E4=BA=8C=E5=BC=95 in the caption I thi=\r\nnk refers \nto the kind of garment, but I don&#39;t know the meaning.  It&#39;s prob=\r\nably \na red herring.  The source page is here:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://www005.upp.so-ne=\r\nt.ne.jp/minbun/news/news21/news21.html\n&gt; \n&gt; Oddly on the same page I notice=\r\nd this \n&gt; http://www005.upp.so-net.ne.jp/minbun/news/news21/kodougu.jpg\n&gt; w=\r\nhich looks like a large harvesting knife in shirasaya with a \nkoshirae.  I&#39;=\r\nve seen plenty of bamboo splitting knives with blades \nlike that, but not w=\r\nith a habaki or koshirae.  Something for a \nperformance?  Does anyone know?=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Jim\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   Dear Members\n&gt; \n&gt;   Can anybody please tell me what =\r\nis meant by the term &#39;nihiki \ndesign&#39;?  \n&gt;   It appears to refer to a tsuba=\r\n design incorporating two \nrectangular \n&gt;   openings, one on each side of t=\r\nhe seppa-dai, but I have never \nbeen \n&gt;   able to identify what, if anythin=\r\ng, these represent.\n&gt; \n&gt;   Regards, John L.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions o=\r\nf this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n"
