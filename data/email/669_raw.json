When\nyou think about it, it makes complete sense, but I doubt anyone would\never take the trouble to figure something like that out over here. \n \nNow, we can tell the fake cutting tests from the genuine ones with a\nsimple swoop.

The\nUmetada did some kinzogan-mei for the Honami.  I seem to recall another\nspecific group that worked for the Honami but I don&#39;t remember who it\nwas.  I&#39;m sure that a variety of kinko inlaid kinzogan-mei and cutting\ntests.  Maybe someone else on the list knows more.\n\nIf I understood correctly, during one of his lectures at the Tampa show\nthis year Tanobe-san mentioned that original Honami kinzogan-mei should\nbe slightly lower than the surface of the nakago.  He explained that as\nthe nakago rusts over the years the volume of the resulting iron oxide\nis greater than that of the iron it developed from.  So the gold inlay\nstays at the level of the original filed surface, but the surrounding\niron &quot;grows thicker&quot; as it rusts.  I haven&#39;t checked it out for myself,\nthough.  Anyone have a good Honami kinzogan-mei handy to check?\n\nJim\n\n\n\n  Gang, I was looking at a sword with a cutting test inscription inlayed\n  in gold today. Part of it had fallen out. \n\n  Now I understand the the inscriptions were done (composed) by the\nHonami\n  family, but who actually inlayed the inscription in gold and how was\n  this done ? \n\n  Did a smith do this, or a kinko artist perhaps ? Or did they do it\n  themselves ?\n\n  - Matt \n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\nYahoo!
