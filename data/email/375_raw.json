I under=\r\nstand that they were not particularly highly thought of 20+ years ago as th=\r\ney were regarded as ultra conservative and not conforming directly with one=\r\n of the 5 traditions. More recently 1 was listed in Comptons 100 masterpiec=\r\nes and I have seen several others (well at least 1) with Juyo certification=\r\n. I bought a O-suriage katana with hozon papers a couple of years ago and h=\r\nave to say I really like it, not least for the fact it is extremely healthy=\r\n ( particularly for a blade that is between 5 and 700 years old) and a powe=\r\nrful blade. Originally it must have been 31+ inches long. Has the school be=\r\ncome more widely appreciated in recent years or is it just us ultra conserv=\r\native suguha fanatics that love them.\nwould value opinions\nregards\npaul\n\n\n\n=\r\n---------------------------------\nWant to chat instantly with your online f=\r\nriends?=A0Get the FREE Yahoo!Messenger\n\n[Non-text portions of this message =\r\nhave been removed]\n\n\n"
