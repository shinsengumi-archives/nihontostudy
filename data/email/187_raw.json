Based\non the size and rusting, I would say late Kamakura to Nambokucho. Sasano did\nnot mention what blade, if any, it was on.\n\nG\n  -----Original Message-----\n  From: Jim Gilbert [mailto:jggilbert@...]\n  Sent: Tuesday, May 06, 2003 7:24 AM\n  To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com\n  Subject: Re: [nihontostudy] Ban Dainagon stuff\n\n\n  By the way, Hatori Jiichiro published the uchigatana and koshigatana\ndetails from Ban Dainagon in his book &quot;Tsuba no Bunkashi&quot; in 1969 (page 26).\nThat was ten years before Sasano did the same  in &quot;Tosogu no Kigen.&quot;\n  Jim\n\n    For those who haven&#39;t seen the book, the best detail online from the Ban\nDainagon I&#39;ve found so far is here:\n\n    http://www.kyohaku.go.jp/gakuso/gakuso02/gs2a28ie.htm\n\n    Look at the fellow in the upper left hand corner.  He is carrying an\nuchigatana with a tsuba, however it&#39;s rather difficult to say whether it\nmight be made of iron, yamagane or leather.\n\n    Gordon - do you have any sort of image of the nagamaki tsuba?  Is it a\nplain iron plate without sukashi?\n\n    Jim\n\n\n\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n        Yahoo!
