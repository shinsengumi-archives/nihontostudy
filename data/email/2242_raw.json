Anyway, you did very well.\n\nJim  \n\n\n\n  All, I picked up some good bargains on the weekend. A full set of  \n  Kanzan Token Koza by Sato Kanzan and a full set of Toso Kodogu Koza by \n  Wakayama Takeshi. I know that books 5 and 6 of Sato&#39;s books are hard to \n  get but I have never see the full set of Toso Kodogu Koza listed \n  anywhere before, well at least in the last 4 or 5 years. Are they quite \n  rare now ?,  I have seen the odd single books around but not the full set.\n\n  Cheers\n\n  Rich Turner\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
