His latest m=\r\novie, &quot;The\nLast Samurai,&quot; falls squarely into the realm of the\nprevious Zwi=\r\nck bedeviled-hero films, &quot;Glory,&quot; &quot;Courage\nUnder Fire&quot; and &quot;The Siege.&quot;\n\nAn=\r\nd I do mean squarely. &quot;Samurai&quot; is a mythic western that\ncombines a fish-ou=\r\nt-of-water theme with an immersion in\nJapanese culture: John Ford&#39;s &quot;Lost i=\r\nn Translation.&quot; It\ndepicts phalanxes of troops moving with deliberate,\nterr=\r\nifying fervor across the very wide screen.\n\nAnd this time Tom Cruise, the c=\r\nan-do idol of millions, uses\nhis polished-chrome smile mirthlessly. At leas=\r\nt for the\nfirst hour, his grin looks like a faded tattoo. The uneven\n&quot;Samur=\r\nai&quot; is a can-do movie that&#39;s far more effective at\ncommunicating emotion in=\r\n bigger scenes than in more\nintimate ones.\n\nMr. Cruise plays Nathan Algren,=\r\n a burned-out former Army\nofficer and Indian fighter. Having survived Custe=\r\nr&#39;s Last\nStand in 1876, he is now a commercial sideshow prop,\ndemonstrating=\r\n the newest Winchester rifle. As Algren\nlumbers through the clich=E9s he&#39;s =\r\nhired to recite before\nblasting away at targets - though the whiskey oozing=\r\n from\nhis pores probably makes him more of a danger than the\nweapon - a sud=\r\nden ember of regret flames in this\nex-soldier&#39;s eyes. He goes off the scrip=\r\nt, reciting the\nhorrors of a campaign in which he and his troops\nslaughtere=\r\nd innocents.\n\nAlgren looks so wasted and beleaguered that the biggest\nquest=\r\nion is not whether he&#39;ll wing an audience member with\na stray shot, but whe=\r\nther he can bear up under the dense,\ncast-iron plot. After being bounced by=\r\n the Winchester\nfolks, Algren is hired by his former commander, Colonel\nBag=\r\nley (Tony Goldwyn, playing a salamanderlike ancestor of\nall the sleazy char=\r\nacters he&#39;s ever portrayed). Bagley\nwants Algren to travel with him to Toky=\r\no and train Japanese\nsoldiers in the use of American tactics and rifles. Th=\r\ne\nMeiji emperor is ready to accept the ways of the West; he&#39;s\nactually bein=\r\ng pressured to by American business interests.\n\nOnce in Japan, Algren is fo=\r\nrced to send his nervous,\nunderprepared imperial troops into battle too soo=\r\nn against\nan enemy of the emperor, the samurai Katsumoto (Ken\nWatanabe). De=\r\nspite the imperial army&#39;s modern weapons,\nKatsumoto and his men sweep in wi=\r\nth ferocity and wield\ntheir arms of the past - swords and spears - with let=\r\nhal\neffectiveness. The cinematographer, John Toll, films their\narrival thro=\r\nugh a thick fog in a forest, as if Katsumoto&#39;s\nmen were ghosts from the rec=\r\nent past out to rob Algren&#39;s\ntroops of their backbones - and their lives.\n\n=\r\nIn their ritual armor, Katsumoto&#39;s men make quick work of\ntheir foes; there=\r\n&#39;s tragicomic relief as Algren&#39;s\nconscripted farmers tremble while trying t=\r\no load their\nguns. When a wounded Algren kills Katsumoto&#39;s second in\ncomman=\r\nd, he&#39;s captured by the invaders and, even more\nbewildering, cared for by K=\r\natsumoto&#39;s sister, Taka\n(Koyuki), the widow of the man Algren murdered.\n\nIt=\r\n&#39;s a complicated story, and Mr. Zwick is complicated,\ntoo: he loves arrogan=\r\nce slapped out of its self-regard.\nAlgren is full of himself, even though h=\r\ne&#39;s conceived as a\nman who was second tenor to a legend; he knew and despis=\r\ned\nCuster. Looking fashionably distressed, with slightly\npuffy, red-rimmed =\r\neyes that at the very least suggest that\nhe&#39;s survived a grueling press jun=\r\nket, Mr. Cruise has a\nworn cockiness. His aw-shucks virility is a little wi=\r\nlted,\nif not mildewed, around the edges: a kind of reverse\nnarcissism, sinc=\r\ne Algren is proud of his dissolution\n(though Mr. Cruise&#39;s good-boy posture =\r\nworks for a man\nreared under the disciplinary rigors of the military).\n\nAlt=\r\nhough at times Mr. Cruise comes off as too contemporary\nfor the 19th centur=\r\ny - at one point, he seems to be waiting\nfor a cellphone call to confirm hi=\r\ns terms for a cover of\nDetails magazine - this displacement fits better whe=\r\nn he\nbecomes a prisoner. Algren appears to be reacting to this\nstrange new =\r\nworld through sounds; nothing he&#39;s hearing\nmakes any sense to him. He&#39;s a m=\r\nangy gaijin that Edgar Rice\nBurroughs might have invented, though James Cla=\r\nvell got\nthere eventually.\n\nThe film includes notable performances by actor=\r\ns not\ndrafted to shoulder the burden of the entire production.\nBilly Connol=\r\nly, emanating a gamy, sly menace that he&#39;s\nrarely suggested before, plays A=\r\nlgren&#39;s former sergeant at\narms, Zebulon Gant. Gant, used to propping up hi=\r\ns old\nfriend and superior officer, joins Algren in the journey to\nJapan. Mr=\r\n. Connolly&#39;s loose, hostile vivacity registers so\nclearly that it&#39;s obvious=\r\n we won&#39;t be seeing very much of\nhim. But this is crackling, rigorous comic=\r\n work; he doesn&#39;t\nhave to present the face of tragedy.\n\nThe far more weight=\r\ned and daring acting comes from Mr.\nWatanabe, as Katsumoto. Probably best k=\r\nnown outside of\nJapan as the reedy, restless sidekick in the gourmand\nclass=\r\nic &quot;Tampopo,&quot; Mr. Watanabe has filled out physically\nand spiritually. The f=\r\normality he brings to Katsumoto is\nhard-won, especially when he&#39;s having po=\r\nintedly thoughtful\nconversations with Algren that sound more like translati=\r\nons\nof ideograms than actual dialogue.\n\nThe film never really explains how =\r\nor why this resolute,\nisolated samurai learned to speak English better than=\r\n the\nemperor. His fluency doesn&#39;t quite make sense, though it\ngives the mov=\r\nie some needed mystique. It plays better than\nthe inexorable pull of romanc=\r\ne, drawing Taka and Algren\ntogether.\n\n&quot;The Last Samurai,&quot; which Mr. Zwick a=\r\nnd Marshall Herskovitz\nwrote with John Logan, from a story by Mr. Logan,\nsu=\r\nper-glues together a host of contradictions.\nUnfortunately, as dramatized, =\r\nthey function as conventions\nthat are older than the story the film is weav=\r\ning. The\nmovie, which opens nationwide today, is most watchable\nduring the =\r\nmajestic brutality of the battle sequences. This\nis not only because of the=\r\n handsome staging, but also\nbecause the keywords sacrifice and honor are ev=\r\noked with\nverve and simplicity, more so than in the &quot;exchange of\nidea&quot; chat=\r\ns between Algren and Katsumoto, which sound like\nstatements being read into=\r\n the Congressional Record by\nNathaniel Hawthorne.\n\nMr. Zwick has absorbed t=\r\nhe lethal agility of Akira\nKurosawa; what registers just as powerfully as t=\r\nhe sureness\nof the combatants is the ugly futility of the battles\nthemselve=\r\ns. When the film sets up the lessons that Algren\nhas to learn, the hero is =\r\nnot really a fish out of water;\nhe&#39;s more like a big fish in a dry pond, pi=\r\ncking up a\nlesson in Eastern deportment and philosophy a step away\nfrom the=\r\n &quot;wax-on, wax-off&quot; curriculum of &quot;The Karate Kid.&quot;\nIn those scenes presagin=\r\ng his Eastern conversion, Algren\ncan&#39;t suppress his eagerness to learn, pic=\r\nking up the ways\nof the sword and the Samurai code of Bushido with an\nalacr=\r\nity that&#39;s mandated for movie stars: flash-card\neducation.\n\nThe film&#39;s titl=\r\ne evokes James Fenimore Cooper, though he\nhad enough perspective not to mak=\r\ne a white man &quot;the last&quot;\nin his novel. Even though &quot;The Last Samurai&quot; opts =\r\nfor\nJapan&#39;s cultural differences, all of the unmentioned\nhardships of a feu=\r\ndal society notwithstanding, the\nremaining honorable native here is an Amer=\r\nican. Is that a\nveiled way of saying that Japan&#39;s old ways were doomed\nafte=\r\nr all?\n\n&quot;The Last Samurai&quot; is rated R (Under 17 requires\naccompanying paren=\r\nt or adult guardian). It has violence,\nincluding enough ritualistic bloodle=\r\ntting for a week on the\nHistory Channel; alcohol use; strong language; and =\r\na chaste\nhint of sexuality.\n\nTHE LAST SAMURAI\n\nDirected by Edward Zwick; wr=\r\nitten by John Logan, Marshall\nHerskovitz and Mr. Zwick, based on a story by=\r\n Mr. Logan;\ndirector of photography, John Toll; edited by Steven\nRosenblum =\r\nand Victor du Bois; music by Hans Zimmer;\nproduction designer, Lilly Kilver=\r\nt; produced by Mr. Zwick,\nMr. Herskovitz, Tom Cruise, Paula Wagner, Scott K=\r\nroopf and\nTom Engelman; released by Warner Brothers Pictures.
