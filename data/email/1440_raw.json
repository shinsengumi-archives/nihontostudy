They do have a unique surface texture that is very uniform and fine grained.  They are known for using a sandwiched construction with a hard skin layer, but I do not know how that layer was finished.  \n\nA common metal working technique is to make a texturing punch from annealed steel by driving it into nicely grained stone and then hardening it.  It&#39;s possible that Ko-Akasaka guards were finished with this sort of tool, but the surface doesn&#39;t look beaten down and the effect is very uniform.  My guess is that it was done another way.\n\nJim\n\n\n\n  Thanks Jim........ reading further Graham discusses a couple of early\n  Akasaka guards. Here he also mentions that the surface is treated in a\n  particular fashion with very tiny and precise &#39;dots&#39; that give the\n  akasaka guards this kind of matt gloss sheen, pretty hard to describe\n  but you can&#39;t miss it when you hold one. I have had the privelidge of\n  handling a couple the last year, but I never noticed this surface\n  &#39;treatment&#39;. \n\n  Do you know anything about that? \n\n  Regards, Matthew. \n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
