It is much finer work indeed. This one of mine is like \na cr=\r\noss between the Ito/Bush=FB ones around in books ( 3 different ones \nfrom m=\r\nemory ) and the Akasaka though I thought mine with the running \nbones in th=\r\ne Mimi and the seppa dai&#39;s shape may be a lter Akasaka, a \nstudents work or=\r\n something. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s bush=FB.\n\nA good score on your behalf too ma=\r\nte. Well done, can you post any pics \nof your tsuba ?.\n\nRich\n\nRon Hartmann =\r\nwrote:\n\n&gt; Rich -\n&gt;\n&gt; Interesting to see this tsuba. My Akasaka of this desi=\r\ngn signed \n&gt; Tadashige (to my relief) passed shinsa in Chicago. Of course I=\r\n have it \n&gt; here in front of me now to compare the work with your tsuba. Wh=\r\nile the \n&gt; design is the same, the work on mine is more delicate (?)--more =\r\n\n&gt; piercing--and seems to &quot;flow&quot; more, if you know what I mean. The \n&gt; hors=\r\ne&#39;s hoofs on your tsuba are more &quot;squared&quot; and &quot;bold&quot; than the \n&gt; more natu=\r\nrally shaped hoofs on my tsuba. I just saw a similar tsuba \n&gt; (picture) jus=\r\nt the other day that showed these rather boldly made \n&gt; hoofs and it was ca=\r\nlled something other than Akasaka, but for the life \n&gt; of me I don&#39;t recall=\r\n where I saw this. Thought it was in the new \n&gt; Mosle&#39; catalogue, but if so=\r\n, I&#39;m not finding it now. My tsuba came out \n&gt; of a large collection of tsu=\r\nba sold in Santiago, Chile in 2003. That \n&gt; collection also had another sim=\r\nilar &quot;horse&quot; tsuba that had these large \n&gt; hoofs like your new tsuba, but I=\r\n didn&#39;t buy that one. Most of these \n&gt; 730-plus tsuba were bought up by Mic=\r\nhael Zomber, so perhaps your&#39;s \n&gt; could be the one I saw. I&#39;ll check my rec=\r\nords.\n&gt;\n&gt; Ron\n&gt; STL\n&gt;\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been remove=\r\nd]\n\n\n"
