However I have no literature stating that this continued into\nthe 17th cent, does anyone know anything about that ?\n \nOne can just imagine some metal worker in Nanking making a tsuba for his\nGreat Grandfathers treasured Japanese sword to take it to war once\nagain........ \n \nI  might add it is extremely unusual for any Chinese artisan to sign\ntheir work with the exception of perhaps paintings. \n \nMatt\n \n \n\n\n    Z Recruiting Services\n    &quot;Zurich Toren&quot; Muzenstraat 89\n    2511 WB Den Haag\n    T: +31 70 4262273\n    F: +31 70 4262111\n    W: zrecruiting.com\n    E: info@...\n    Kijk ook op monsterboard.nl, jobbingmall.nl en \n    nationalevacaturebank.nl voor actuele vacatures!\n\n\n-----Oorspronkelijk bericht-----\nVan: Jim Gilbert [mailto:jggilbert@...] \nVerzonden: woensdag 3 december 2003 1:17\nAan: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com\nOnderwerp: Re: [nihontostudy] A little help please?\n\n\nBuddy and Peter,\nI&#39;ve been mulling this one over, too.  The only example I can think of\nthat&#39;s a hard data point is a tsuba in the Boston Museum collection.\nIt&#39;s number 354 in the Ogawa catalog.  It is a piece that has nakago,\nkozuka and kogai ana that are typical of a guard made for a Japanese\nsword.  I don&#39;t see any evidence that it was made for another type of\nsword and modified for nihonto use.  Quoting from the catalog, this\ntsuba is signed:\n\n&quot;Nan-ching yu -- Ch&#39;ang Lo-chiao tsao K&#39;ang-hsi (ting) - wei (sui)\nCh&#39;ang Lo-chiao tsao\n\n(Residing in Nanking, made by Ch&#39;ang Lo-chiao.  Made in the [ting]-sheep\n[year] of K&#39;ang-hsi [1667] by Ch&#39;ang Lo-chiao)&quot;\n\nIt is not in one of the typical &quot;Nanban&quot; tsuba styles, but there is some\nof that taste to it in the overlapping foliage motif.  Can anyone\ndiscuss or dispute the reading of the signature?  Any comments on the\nguard?\n\nThe text mentions another example signed with the same name.  I found\none unsigned example with the same decorative motif and workmanship.\n\nI don&#39;t remember seeing any guards for Chinese swords with signatures.\nHas anyone?\n\nJim\n\n\n\n\n  Now on to your question.\n\n  Over the past couple of years, I have gotten quite interested in tsuba\nthat\n  seem - to me - to show direct influence between Japanese and foreign\n  swords. In generic terms these are assigned to the &quot;Namban&quot; style.\nWithin\n  that categories there are masses of clearly Japanese stuff. Then there\nare\n  some guards that seem to have obvious referents to European rapiers or\n  smallsword guards. And then there are  guards that have been adapted\nfor\n  use with Japanese blades altho they also seem to be of Chinese\nmanufactures\n  These come in two type - at least. First there are some cupped tsuba\nthat\n  seem to have been made in China and used in Japan. The other type is\nmore\n  classically &quot;Namban&quot; but with no sign of accommodation to nippon-to.\nAnd\n  they show up in placed like Tibet and Nepal.\n  To my eye, these tsuba show diverse international influence that is\nnot\n  surprising, given the way East Asia worked in the 16th and 17th\ncentury.\n  John Lissenden wrote a very interesting MA thesis on this school at\nthe\n  University of Durham, last year. I am sure that he will try to see it\n  published, but that has not happened yet. Beyond that there is a lot\nof\n  other discussion of these issues whenever the Namban category is\ndescribed.\n\n  Best of luck\n  P.
