They have not fallen on deaf ears.\nI am very new at this and I have already discovered some valueable lessons.\nI just wanted to share that with Kim.  It can be frustrating reading of\nthese e-mails and not really knowing what&#39;s being said but it&#39;s a &quot;process&quot;\nlike anything else. The &quot;learning curve&quot; is extremely steep at this point\nand there have been a few &quot;nose bleeds&quot;,  LOL!  But like you said, &quot;study,\nstudy, study&quot;.\n\nI couldn&#39;t agree more with  &quot;Nihonto&quot; picking me. LOL!    O.K., &quot;Grandfather\nlesson # 1&quot;,   DO NOT SELL MY BOOKS       Got it!

I laugh at it now but it didn&#39;t\nsit well...\n\n  Had to laugh at this comment because we have all experienced this thinking\nsomewhere along the way. Actually, I doubt that many of us &quot;picked&quot; this\nhobby; rather, I think the hobby picked those of us having that &quot;spark,&quot;\nthat fascination (obsession?) with ancient things needing preserving.\n\n  &gt;not having a &quot;ton of money&quot;...\n\n  Today, I sometimes wonder how the newer collectors bitten by this interest\nsurvive, seeing the cost of things today. Then I realize that 35 years ago\nwhen swords could be bought for $25, many of us struggled to purchase those\n&quot;cheapies.&quot; Fresh out of the navy and with a new wife and baby, and making\nsquat in salary, I had to peddle whatever could be found and then hoard\nthose dollars for when a sword of interest was found. Fun times, indeed! So\nI suppose things never change.\n\n  &gt;Whatever you spend on books, you will save when you come to buy your\npieces.\n\n  Truer words where never written! My only regrets regarding books are the\nbooks I sold off, thinking I&#39;d never really use them. Buy they better books\nas they come out because once they are out-of-print, the price exculates.\nYes, the internet has a wealth of information on it but there is nothing\nlike researching a sword of kodogu with a good library at your fingertips.\nYou recommended &quot;educate yourself&quot; and that is the key to advancing in our\narea of study. I too was told to &quot;study, study, study&quot; when I met my first\nknowledgeable person familiar with Japanese swords (Dr. Thomas Hoopes) back\naround 1968.\n\n  Sorry...feeling &quot;grandfatherly&quot; today...just had to add my few cents worth\nto this discussion.\n\n  Ron\n  STL\n    ----- Original Message -----\n    From: Mark Jaillet\n    To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com\n    Sent: Tuesday, July 12, 2005 9:55 AM\n    Subject: RE: [nihontostudy] RE: Question....\n\n\n    Hi Kim,\n                        As a complete beginner myself, rest assured, there\nis\n    information out there. It will not however fall into your lap. There is\na\n    ton of information on the web. I do not live in a &quot;Nihonto Knowledge\nRich\n    Enviroment&quot;!  My only contact for information is the web.  As far as not\n    having a &quot;ton of money&quot;,  I once mentioned the same statement to my very\n    first contact in the Nihonto world. His reply to me was that maybe I\nshould\n    pick another hobbie!  I laugh at it now but it didn&#39;t sit well with me\nwhen\n    he first told me. It forced me to re-focus my train of thought. EDUCATE\n    yourself Kim. Whatever you spend on books, you will save when you come\nto\n    buy your pieces.\n\n    Your frustration came across load and clear! As a beginner, I could\nrelate.\n    I agree with Barry, we are all busy. Do not think that you are being\n    intensionally ignored.\n\n    Good luck in your quest.
