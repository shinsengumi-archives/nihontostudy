Also, while the first two generations started working in copper alloy after leaving Echizen, I don&#39;t think that they stopped making iron tsuba.  FWIW, I have an iron sukashi guard signed Kofu ju Akao Yoshitsugu.  This would probably be the third generation or later.  Your kanji for the nidai signature did not come out for me.  Sorting out generations from the signatures without personal names is not straightforward.  \n\nJim\n\n\n  All, does anyone know if the Akao smith Yoshitsugu ( Shodai and Nidai ) \n  was the only smith of this group ( 9 generations I think ) that worked \n  in tetsu ?. I see the 1st and the 2nd Yoshitsugu worked in Shakudo \n  Sukashi after they moved to Edo, but worked in iron whilst in Echizen. \n  Did any of the other 7 Yoshitsugu&#39;s work in Iron, or were they all in \n  Shakudo and Shibuichi plate.\n\n  Also, I see the Nidai signed ???? ( Akao Yoshitsugu if the kanji does \n  not come out ), did any other of the group sign this way ?.\n\n  Cheers\n\n  Rich Turner\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
