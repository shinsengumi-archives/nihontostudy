Sometimes you will find some numbers stamped on the nakago (tang) of a sword, usually two or three digits, which in that case might relate to &quot;assembly&quot; numbers; these same numbers are often repeated on seppa, tsuba, etc. Swords were &quot;registered&quot; after the war and continue to be so today, but the Japanese government never required anything (registration numbers) to be stamped on swords. \n\nRon\nSTL\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: dpoll64 \n  To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Wednesday, January 04, 2006 3:12 PM\n  Subject: [nihontostudy] SERIAL NUMBERS ON JAPANESE SWORDS\n\n\n  Firstly, happy  new  year and nice  to meeet  you  all. I am  new  at  \n  this so I  have a question that  one  of  you may be  able to  help  \n  me  with.\n\n  After  WWII did the  Allies  make  the  Japanese  register their  \n  swords and were the  swords  stamped with a serial number after  \n  registration?\n\n  If this is  true,   does  anybody  know  how  I can get  access to \n  these  registers so that  I  can   trace  the  history  of these  \n  numbered  swords.\n\n  regards\n\n  David\n\n\n\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  YAHOO!
