Of course postage is on top of \nthat and I have no id=\r\nea what that would be, however, I paid AUD$60 \nfor it from a local collecto=\r\nr who no longer wanted it and I was quite \nglad to have it.  I cannot find =\r\nit on Amazon, but Wikipedia has some \ninformation on Rokusho:\n&gt; http://en.w=\r\nikipedia.org/wiki/Rokusho\n&gt; \n&gt; I found this altogether fascinating and, for=\r\n a primarily blade man, \nvery interesting indeed.  Some of the Wikipedia li=\r\nnks under the \nlisted catogories of Artistic techniques | Decorative art | =\r\n\nMetallurgy may be of interest to many of you.
