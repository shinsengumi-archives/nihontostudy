Goto ke Junanadai (17 Generations of Goto). 1973. 258 pages with\n  photos of fittings, diagrams of motifs and examination of written\n  inscriptions. Hard Cover with Slipcase.\n\n  A great book, wish I had a copy or two on hand, but they sell when I get\n  them ...\n\n  On the Goto menuki Peter asked about, are there examples in the Fukushi book\n  that you can refer us to?\n\n  Craig\n\n  -- \n  Craig Harris\n  Books from and about Asia\n  www.bridgeofdreams.com\n\n  On 5/27/06, Barry Thomas &lt;warlord@...&gt; wrote:\n  &gt;\n  &gt; Blokes,\n  &gt;\n  &gt; The story I remember is that menuki are vestigial ornaments from pre-Heian\n  &gt; times\n  &gt; when the tsuka was fixed to the nakago with a rivet that was not\n  &gt; removable.  The\n  &gt; heads of the rivet were decorated and eventually became the menuki we know\n  &gt; today.  What I did not know until these emails is that some menuki have\n  &gt; &quot;interlocking pins&quot; to become mekugi.  Sure, I&#39;ve seen these on cheap\n  &gt; Meiji\n  &gt; pieces, especially tanto, but didn&#39;t know early Goto menuki had the same\n  &gt; feature.  We can clearly see that as the Nihonto developed from earliest\n  &gt; times\n  &gt; the disadvantage of a fixed rivet became evident, but the early menuki\n  &gt; discussed\n  &gt; appear to have still functioned as a mekugi, only later becoming separate\n  &gt; with a\n  &gt; bamboo mekugi, or mekugi of other material (iron??).  I also remember that\n  &gt; in\n  &gt; the Momoyama period a single menuki was used, accounting for some of the\n  &gt; &quot;orphans&quot; we see.  Looking back over my collecting career I think I once\n  &gt; had a\n  &gt; single (i.e., never a pair) shakudo menuki of a pomegranate.  It was of\n  &gt; that\n  &gt; really dark black shakudo.  Sometimes knowledge comes too late to save us\n  &gt; from\n  &gt; ourselves!!!\n  &gt;\n  &gt; Ken, I do have somewhere a late 19th century English treatise on the Goto\n  &gt; mainline (Shirobei 17 generations) with photos, but it doesn&#39;t go into the\n  &gt; &quot;secret marks&quot;...  Does anyone know the title of the Japanese one that Ken\n  &gt; mentions??\n  &gt;\n  &gt; Regards,\n  &gt;\n  &gt; Barry Thomas.\n  &gt;\n  &gt; ----- Original Message -----\n  &gt; From: &quot;Kenneth Wilson&quot; &lt;kdw21620@...&gt;\n  &gt; To: &lt;nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n  &gt; Sent: Sunday, May 28, 2006 12:34 AM\n  &gt; Subject: Re: [nihontostudy] Menuki Posts\n  &gt;\n  &gt;\n  &gt; Yes, I believe that at one point the menuki where\n  &gt; &quot;interlocking&quot; with each other, at least on some\n  &gt; styles of sword mounting design.  I can&#39;t remember\n  &gt; what I had read about it, but I think this was the\n  &gt; combo of the mekugi-ana and the menuki, but overtime\n  &gt; the menuki and peg seperated and served different\n  &gt; roles.  ok I took a stab at it, now someone can\n  &gt; correct what I said.  Would love an english\n  &gt; translation  of the 17 generations of goto (can&#39;t\n  &gt; remember japanese tittle) in which all the secret\n  &gt; marks are revealed.\n  &gt; Ken\n  &gt;\n  &gt; --- klepet33319 &lt;Ppeterdds@...&gt; wrote:\n  &gt;\n  &gt; &gt; Hello all.
