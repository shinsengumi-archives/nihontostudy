Arnold\n\nThat&#39;s what I thought, then when I saw the tsunagi I thought that was a\nvery strange thing to be writing on the tsunagi. \n\nWhenever I&#39;ve seen it on a tsunagi before, it&#39;s always something like\nthe long name of the smith, or else the signature that is on the blade. \n\n- darcy\n\n\n\n\n \nYahoo!
