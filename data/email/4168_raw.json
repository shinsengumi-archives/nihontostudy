To \n&gt;   find a st=\r\niffer\n&gt;   &gt;   deer one would have to go to the tundra...\n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt;   I r=\r\necall well a tsuba that I found many years ago.  It was a \n&gt;   small, coppe=\r\nr\n&gt;   &gt;   sanmai awase (if I correctly remember a phrase I haven&#39;t \nuttered=\r\n \n&gt;   for 15 or more\n&gt;   &gt;   years!) with a touch of silver (tin??) showing=\r\n stylised \n&gt;   (stamped?) waves with a\n&gt;   &gt;   creature on it that I always=\r\n thought was an &quot;over-endowed \n&gt;   rabbit&quot;, but Bob\n&gt;   &gt;   Haynes told me =\r\nwas a fox!!  I wrote to Bob when I saw a \nsimilar \n&gt;   tsuba in one of\n&gt;   =\r\n&gt;   his catalogues.  I was amazed when he said this was a very \nearly \n&gt;   =\r\nstyle of tsuba\n&gt;   &gt;   ca 1300 - 1400.  I had it for years, often looking a=\r\nt it and \n&gt;   saying &quot;Do I like\n&gt;   &gt;   it, or do I not??&quot;  Same thing with=\r\n this deer kinko.  I have \n&gt;   gazed at Pete\n&gt;   &gt;   Klein&#39;s image on yahoo=\r\n (I actually have the Lundren \nCollection \n&gt;   book, but it&#39;s\n&gt;   &gt;   out o=\r\nn loan to a &#39;kinko&#39; mate) for a long time on this \nsleepless \n&gt;   night, an=\r\nd I\n&gt;   &gt;   ask myself the same question all over again.  So David Z, if \nI=\r\n \n&gt;   could ask you a\n&gt;   &gt;   question, when you say &quot;I don&#39;t collect kinko=\r\n at all,  but \nthis \n&gt;   is one of a\n&gt;   &gt;   small number of cases which, g=\r\nranted a opportunity, would \nlead me \n&gt;   to alter my\n&gt;   &gt;   policy&quot; I hav=\r\ne to ask you &quot;WHY??&quot;  Please explain.\n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt;   If I found this very t=\r\nsuba I would think it was junk.  I \ndon&#39;t \n&gt;   have to tell you\n&gt;   &gt;   why=\r\n.  Or do I??  The design spilling into the seppadai I have \n&gt;   only seen o=\r\nn tsuba\n&gt;   &gt;   I didn&#39;t care for.  The wobbly surface and incredibly bad \n=\r\nnanako \n&gt;   would kill it\n&gt;   &gt;   for me.  And the stiff deer doesn&#39;t do an=\r\nything for me at \nall.  \n&gt;   However, I would\n&gt;   &gt;   look at the larger th=\r\nan usual kozuka ana and opine &quot;Hmmm, \nmaybe \n&gt;   it&#39;s early&quot;.\n&gt;   &gt;   Back =\r\nto my question to myself &quot;Do I like it, or do I not&quot;.  \nIf I \n&gt;   don&#39;t lik=\r\ne it,\n&gt;   &gt;   I don&#39;t collect it, no matter what the aesthetes say.\n&gt;   &gt; \n=\r\n&gt;   &gt;   Now, this puts me into the rustic class, I know, but there is \na \n&gt;=\r\n   point to this\n&gt;   &gt;   that is not all derisory or derogatory.  It is thi=\r\ns.  It is \neasy \n&gt;   to pick\n&gt;   &gt;   excellent work amongst Edo period tsub=\r\na , even in the \niron &quot;wabi-\n&gt;   sabi&quot; class,\n&gt;   &gt;   but the archaic style=\r\ns, the transition between (if we might \nsay) \n&gt;   conceptual\n&gt;   &gt;   foreru=\r\nnners and the refined later schools is much, much more \n&gt;   difficult.  Or =\r\nis\n&gt;   &gt;   it??  Recall here Milt&#39;s hawk tsuba that lead to the present \n&gt; =\r\n  discussion.  And I\n&gt;   &gt;   can show you a tsuba that a well-educated (tsu=\r\nba knowledge) \nmate \n&gt;   of mine\n&gt;   &gt;   dismissed as &quot;late, possibly 1920s=\r\n&quot;.  It is a masterwork of \nlate \n&gt;   Edo/early Meiji\n&gt;   &gt;   and belongs to=\r\n a friend of mine.  If he gives permission I&#39;ll \nput \n&gt;   up some images\n&gt; =\r\n  &gt;   of it.\n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt;   So, to bring this to a close, are there any oth=\r\ners inhabiting \nthe \n&gt;   same closet as\n&gt;   &gt;   I???  I know I&#39;m lacking an=\r\n ability, an aesthetic if you \nlike, to \n&gt;   appreciate the\n&gt;   &gt;   stiff d=\r\neer kinko in question and it worries me.  It seems \nwithout \n&gt;   thorough s=\r\ntudy\n&gt;   &gt;   and training many tsuba in this time frame would indeed be \n&gt; =\r\n  considered junk and\n&gt;   &gt;   sold off, possibly to an ignominious fate.  T=\r\nhe other kinko \nthat \n&gt;   Pete shows in\n&gt;   &gt;   two images at the same link=\r\n does &quot;speak to me&quot;.  It is from \nthe \n&gt;   same time frame\n&gt;   &gt;   and I fi=\r\nnd it elegant and refined and would collect it.  I \nthink \n&gt;   this discuss=\r\nion\n&gt;   &gt;   parallels the Sue Koto kazuuchimono line of thinking with \nblad=\r\nes -\n&gt;   I don&#39;t\n&gt;   &gt;   collect those either...\n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt;   Barry Thoma=\r\ns\n&gt;   &gt;   (Melbourne, Australia)\n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt;   ----- Original Message ----=\r\n-\n&gt;   &gt;   From: &quot;klepet33319&quot; &lt;Ppeterdds@&gt;\n&gt;   &gt;   To: &lt;nihontostudy@yahoog=\r\nroups.com&gt;\n&gt;   &gt;   Sent: Monday, April 17, 2006 5:50 AM\n&gt;   &gt;   Subject: [n=\r\nihontostudy] Re: in defense of the ugly bird or \n&gt;   seeking more &quot;\n&gt;   &gt;  =\r\n punishment &quot;\n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt;   Link to scan &#39;deer&#39; tsuba from Lundgren=\r\n collection:\n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt;   \nhttp://ph.groups.yahoo.com/group/nihontostudy/=\r\nphotos/view/7936?b=3D3\n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt;   SPONSORED LINKS Buy fine art  =\r\nJapanese translation  Japanese \n&gt;   incense  \n&gt;   &gt;         Fine art inkjet=\r\n paper  Fine art printing  Fine art \n&gt;   appraisal  \n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; --=\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n----\n&gt;   ---=\r\n-------\n&gt;   &gt;   YAHOO!
