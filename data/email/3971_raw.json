I notice most bones appear =\r\non the mimi but not( usually ) the flat \nsurface, is it due to the forging =\r\nprocess ?

The ko-Shoami tsuba I have in the folder also show traces =\r\nof &quot; \nhada &quot;, I notice one on the mimi that is a circle (like mokume ) whic=\r\nh \nis not bone, may be the gold nunome on the flat surfce of the rim is to =\r\n\nfill in those &quot; openining edges &quot; of mokume hada as I see nodefinite \npatt=\r\nern to the nunome ?\n\nMuchias Gracias.......\n\nmilt\n\n\n\n\n\n"
