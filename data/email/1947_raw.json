Cary Condell speaks very highly of Fujishiro Matsuo&#39;s son, \nFujishiro Okisato and I take him on his word on this matter. It is \nwonderful to know this organization is in good hands. My friend and I \nwere also talking of other more &quot;singular&quot; giants of nihonto such as \nShibata Sensei and who his replacement would be in his business. This \nled me to Hagihara Sensei, does he have a protege ?, who will replace \nhim when he passes on or retires ?. Is there much in the way of up and \ncoming&#39;s in line after the likes of Shibata, Tanobe and other sensei ?.\n\nRich Turner\n\narnold frenzel wrote:\n\n&gt; Hi Jim:\n&gt; Can you confirm that Hagihara sensei will still be doing the kodogu at\n&gt; Chicago?
