It wasn&#39;t unusual to see a one guy submit a big group of items with 90% passing and the next do the same with 90% failing.  It&#39;s quite a report card for those willing to read it.  Of course I suppose shinsa is still very cheap compared to long-term serious study.\n\nJim\n  I had a good laugh over that.  Some years ago four of us from my part of the world travelled 600 miles to see some collector mates in another State.  It was a great get together and we stayed for 5 days enjoying the hospitality and the viewings.  One of our mates there has had a collection of fittings for many years.  At one stage of the proceedings he cried out &quot;Why isn&#39;t anyone looking at the fittings??!!&quot;  The following words sprang unbidden to my mind &quot;Because they&#39;re all crap mate&quot;.  He did have a couple of nice pieces, but the rest...  When I hear about the &quot;rain of pink slips&quot; at Shinsa I know people aren&#39;t even beginning to try and do their own study and homework, like my mate who prefers to &quot;keep and dream&quot; rather than find out or even advance his knowledge.  I&#39;ve always used Shinsa to back my own judgement.  In the early daze I had blades fail, but I never had a tosogu fail.  The learning curve is steep and long.\n\n  Best regards,\n\n  Barry Thomas.\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
