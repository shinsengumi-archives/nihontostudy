I would urge you not to alter you=\r\nr  sword\nin the way you are describing. If you want a grooved blade order o=\r\nne or\nfind one. At the very least you should not do anything until you have=\r\n had\nyour blade well shinsa&#39;d.\nStill, your question does point up a basic f=\r\neature of the world of\nnippon-to. The values and standards of the various p=\r\neople involved in\nJapanese swords are diverse. What is absolutely &quot;wrong&quot; t=\r\no some is &quot;just\nfine&quot; to others. Most of us base our actions on our views o=\r\nf aesthetics and\na sense of historical preservation. There are other values=\r\n out there and\nknowing that helps to understand some of the things we see a=\r\nbout swords.\nWhen I was first in Japan I happened to meet a number of sword=\r\n craftsmen\nrather than collectors. Of course this was interesting (heck, it=\r\n was\nwonderful), but it may have given me a skewed view.\n1. The first &quot;smit=\r\nh&quot; I met ( and he was an important artist-and a\nwonderful person) was re-te=\r\nmpering some old swords when I visited his\nforge.\n2.  An important kinko pr=\r\noudly showed me his portfolio that included some\nvery excellent &quot;umegane&quot; w=\r\nork he had done. He assured me that &quot;no one could\nsee&quot; the fillings he had =\r\nput into some seriously flawed blades.\n3. During a road trip with a fellow =\r\nwho had recently completed his\npolishing apprenticeship, we took a long ext=\r\nra trip to let his teacher see\nthe grooves he was carving on a tanto. He wa=\r\ns proud of his work and his\nmaster approved. When I asked why he was doing =\r\nit, he said &quot;the smith\nshould have put the grooves in.&quot;\nThese men are not c=\r\nrooks or villains. Indeed, I think they are great\nartists and skilled stude=\r\nnts, but they operate with a different set of\nvalues.\nYou certainly can fin=\r\nd craftsmen who will do what you ask of them, but one\nthing is clear. You w=\r\nill only be able to cut grooves in your sword once. I\nurge you to proceed w=\r\nith caution.\nPeter\n\nPeter Bleed\nProfessor of Anthropology\n810 Oldfather Hal=\r\nl\nUniversity of Nebraska\nLincoln, NE 68588-0368\n(402) 472-2439\n\n\n          =\r\n                                                                 \n         =\r\n    &quot;Gordon Robson&quot;                                               \n        =\r\n     &lt;robsongo@....                                             \n       =\r\n      jp&gt;                                                        To \n      =\r\n       Sent by:                  &lt;nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com&gt;      \n     =\r\n        nihontostudy@yaho                                          cc \n    =\r\n         ogroups.com                                                   \n   =\r\n                                                                Subject \n  =\r\n                                     RE: [nihontostudy] Bo-hi            \n =\r\n            12/05/2006 05:16                                              \n=\r\n             PM                                                            =\r\n\n                                                                          =\r\n \n                                                                         =\r\n  \n             Please respond to                                          =\r\n   \n             nihontostudy@yaho                                         =\r\n    \n                ogroups.com                                           =\r\n     \n                                                                     =\r\n      \n                                                                    =\r\n       \n\n\n\n\nHi Enore,\n\nAre you talking about taking an antique sword and cu=\r\ntting a groove in it? I\nhope not. There is no one I know of in Japan who wo=\r\nuld do that. And I think\nyou would be hard pressed to find someone who woul=\r\nd even do it to a newly\nmade blade. The sword comes as it is and anything a=\r\ndded later is typically\nnot seen as a good thing.\n\nGordon\n\n-----Original Me=\r\nssage-----\nFrom: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com [mailto:nihontostudy@yahoogro=\r\nups.com] On\nBehalf Of egardonio\nSent: Wednesday, December 06, 2006 2:28 AM\n=\r\nTo: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: [nihontostudy] Bo-hi\n\nHello every=\r\nbody, I&#39;m new to this forum so if I make an error please\nremember that.
