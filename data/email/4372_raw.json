This is the Gendaito smith \nthat became a intangible cultural asset of Gifu prefecture in 1973. It \nturns out that part of the kanji, on the right hand side of the ura side \nof the nakago, have been deleted.\n\nThe left hand side I think translates as\n\n&quot;This blade was presented to the person, who&#39;s name has been deleted, \nfor his sincere assistance in the shipping department at the the \nHankengoku Educational Institution located by the Kizugawa (Kizu River) \nin Kyoto, in Greater Japan. &quot;\n\nThis is with help from Harry Watson (thanks) but any mistakes are all my \ndoing. \n\nOn the right hand side of the ura all that is left is something like\n\n&quot;This blade was presented to someone of rank that could be called His \nMajesty&quot;\n\n&lt;&gt;Many of the kanji have been erased/deleted.\n\nYou can see images of the nakago and the kanji that I have identified at\n\nhttp://www.montanairon.com/images2.html\n\n&lt;&gt;Now my questions are\n\n1. Does any one know anything about this Hankengoku Educational Institution?\n\n2. Is there enough information still on the nakago to identify who the \nblade was presented to?\n\n3. Is there a way to raise the deleted kanji?\n\n            Like they do one guns with the serial numbers filed off!\n\n  &lt;&gt;\nThanks for any help.\n\n \n\nlater\n\ndavid\n\n-- \nDavid McDonald                  Collector of Japanese Swords and Old Iron \nPO Box 265                      WEB page - http://www.montanairon.com \nSidney MT  59270                email - jswords@... \n406-482-3243  evenings          I do tsukamaki (wrapping of sword hilts) \n\nOwner of White IH Cub & Super A Farmall, IH 100 & 130, 140, AC G  \nMcD type M, Monitor, Frost King and other stationary engines. \n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
