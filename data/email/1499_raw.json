I hadn&#39;t noticed the term Yujo yasuri before, although as I mentioned in an earlier post he does seem to be the first one applying fine sujigai yasuri to gold kogai, at least as far as surviving and published examples go.\n\n  Checking Kajihara&#39;s glossary again, the terms Yujo-yasuri habaki and koshi-Yujo habaki are listed in the habaki section on page 146.  There is no drawing for a Yujo-yasuri habaki, just some text.  There is a drawing of a koshi-Yujo habaki, which looks like the ones you pointed out.  Both sources are saying that the fine filework on the lower half are the Yujo-yasuri.  I think that the work on the upper part is what is usually referred to as cat scratch.  Although Kajihara describes the term nekogaki, he doesn&#39;t provide an illustration.   \n\n  I have never seen file work by Yujo or other Goto makers that had the raised and burnished burs that appear on these habaki.  Their file marks are fine and smooth.  Probably a somewhat different tool and/or technique.  This work with the raised bumps is quite typical of habaki, but I have seen it on the backs of some machibori kodogu.\n\n  Oddly the text in Kajihara about Yujo yasuri habaki does not appear in the English translation volume.  It says something like that this is a kind of ji-yasuri habaki that is called Yujo-yasuri because it is like the style of yasuri particular to Yujo.  The koshi-Yujo habaki is based on this. \n\n  If someone knows more about this or other habaki lore, please let us know.\n\n  Jim\n\n\n\n    Ok guys, check this out: http://www.ksky.ne.jp./~sumie99/habaki.html\n\n    look at the third type of habaki, a gold and silver one are illustrated\n    called &#39;koshi-Yujo&#39;. \n\n    Who was Yujo and is this a type of &#39;cat scratch&#39; habaki?\n\n    - Matt\n\n\n\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n        Yahoo!
