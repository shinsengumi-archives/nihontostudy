It was\n  thin -  3 mm - and rather small, but showed a wonderful delamination flaw\n  and a very sabishii set of 4 &#39;arrow fletch&#39; cut-outs. It clearly is an old\n  soldier that I&#39;ll bet you dates from the later Muromachi period. I rather\n  like these things, but this one was in  &quot;as found condition&quot; which meant it\n  was terribly dirty and seemingly covered with red rust and some kind of\n  really noxious pucky. At first I thought that I should just throw it in the\n  junk box, but decided to give it a bit of &#39;treatment.&#39;\n        After a good boiling, it was clean enough to show the laminations,\n  but it was also entirely bright. In that condition It wouldn&#39;t look good\n  even in the junk box, so I invited it to have a bit of color. It responded\n  nicely, but it was now rather fresh. Here&#39;s the tip I discovered. I used a\n  bit of boar tusk to &quot;bone&quot; the surface. I used this in the usual way, to\n  burnish the flat surfaces and clean out the sukashi and the rim. I was VERY\n  impresses that the tusk seemed to work better than the antler does. It was\n  not hard enough to scratch the surface so that it left no bright  lines. It\n  also was hard enough to leave not dusty residue on the surface. But it did\n  a nice job of finishing the surface and quickly turned it a nice dark\n  blue/black. With a dab of oil, and in less than an hour, this tsuba went\n  from a questionable buy to a presentable piece I was pleased to hang with\n  my other swordsmith guards.\n        I could never have done this sort of thing with a finer or more\n  valuable tsuba, but in this case I felt I not getting beyond my\n  capabilities and also that I was preserving an old guard that was &#39;at\n  risk.&#39; From now one, I am going to use the harder tusk rather than antler.\n  Ahhh the joys of collecting\n\n\n  Peter Bleed\n\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  Yahoo!
