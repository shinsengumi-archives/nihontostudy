Any takers???\n\nRegards,\nBarry Thomas.\n\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: excelsiorilluminati \n  To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Friday, February 23, 2007 11:24 AM\n  Subject: [nihontostudy] Re: NAMBAN TETSU\n\n\n  Hi, ThAround the 11th or 12th year of this same period of Keicho \n  (1606-1607), Yasutsugu&#39;s fame reached the point that he was called to \n  Edo (Tokyo) to share his time with Tokugawa Ieyasu. About this time \n  Yasutsugu was given the privilege of using the character &quot;Yasu&quot; from \n  Tokugawa Ieyasu&#39;s name. Thus he changed his name to Yasutsugu from \n  that point on. About the same time ( some feel it was a few years \n  later) he was given the additional privilege of carving the Hollyhock \n  crest ( Aoi mon) on his blades. These privileges were given in \n  perpetuity to Yasutsugu and his descendents. Thus the Yasutsugu \n  swordsmiths became the kaji of the Tokugawa Family.\n\n  Earlier I raised the question of what made Yasutsugu&#39;s fame and \n  fortune seem to spread disproportionately to his skill when we \n  compare him to some of his contemporary smiths such as Umetada Myoju \n  and Horikawa Kunihiro. About this time, non oriental foreigners made \n  their presence felt in Japan for the first time. Things from \n  the &quot;West&quot; were new, exciting, strange, and highly sought after. \n  Yasutsugu was one of the first advocates of using namban tetsu \n  (foreign steel) in his swords. He proudly incised this fact on the \n  nakago of his later works. It was new, it was exciting, and there is \n  no doubt that this use of foreign steel helped spread his fameis is \n  from an article on nihonto.com\n\n  --- In nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Alan Bale&quot; &lt;abale@...&gt; wrote:\n  &gt;\n  &gt; To All,\n  &gt; Yasutsugu 1st inscribed &#39;Nanban tetsu wo motte&#39; on some of his \n  swords, according to the Meikan his dated blades range from 1613 to \n  1621\n  &gt; Alan\n  . \n   \n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
