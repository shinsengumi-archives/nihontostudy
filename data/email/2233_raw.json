How about a sword that is retempered, or more closely\nthat is downgraded because the horimono is atoh-bori? What about a\nRembrandt that some later artist &quot;improved&quot; by brightening up one of\nthose dark backgrounds? Sword polishing is reductive, these other things\nare additive.\n Arnold Frenzel\n  \n\n\n\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; alchemyst@... 09/27/04 4:26 AM &gt;&gt;&gt;\n--- In nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com, &quot;bungotakadasword&quot; \n&lt;MuramasaIII@a...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Jim,\n&gt;  While making copies for the Chicago shinsa,I notice an iron tsuba \n&gt; got the pinkie ........reason given was the inlays were added later.\n&gt; Why is that ?  I mean if the soft metal inlays were added in the Edo \n&gt; days, it was &quot; fashionable &quot; then and not meant to deceive .\n&gt; I recall that tsuba was a mumei.\n&gt; \n\nVery interested in the reply here. Seems to me a lot of\nvery good tsuba had inlay which were later applications.\nKo-Nara, Heianjo, etc commonly used Saotome tsuba as\nstarting points. Also most of the gomoku zogan and mukade\nstyles, the inlay or wire is a later addition. I&#39;m sure\nmany other examples could be cited. Does that\nmean none of those are eligible for papers?\n\nRich S\n\n\n\n\n\n \nYahoo! Groups Links\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n"
