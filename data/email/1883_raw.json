Let me resend this...\n\nG&#39;day Rich - \n\nMy opin=\r\nions are based largely on &quot;gut feeling&quot; when seeing the guard since, on pho=\r\ntographs at least, these groups do resemble each other. Having the tsuba in=\r\n-hand would of course make for a stronger argument for (or against) the gro=\r\nups mentioned, I would think. \n\nMaybe I shouldn&#39;t had called the edge treat=\r\nment &quot;bones&quot; but it would be the lines visiable from the three-fold constru=\r\nction of Akasaka. Last year I purchased a wonderful &quot;willow tree&quot; iron suka=\r\nshi tsuba, mumei--one of my &quot;dream&quot; tsuba ever since Sasano illustrated thi=\r\ns motif in his sukashi tsuba book. I felt it was Akasaka and it did have th=\r\nese linear lines (bones?) in its edge. Jim Gilbert and Henrik Eschbaum...\n\n=\r\n(Was checking a spelling and accidently &quot;sent&quot; this...hope I got the right =\r\nname here!)\n\nAnyway, they did agree to Akasaka and pointed out this layerin=\r\ng which was quite evident on this tsuba. Of course, I was thrilled. In this=\r\n case the guard could had been Kyo-sukashi or even Higo. It brought some ni=\r\nce discussion.\n\nAs for Tosa Myochin, I have not had a lot of experience wit=\r\nh their work but do think the plate might not be a &quot;good&quot; compared to Akasa=\r\nka. They also often used the &quot;mustache&quot; type chiseling around the nakago-an=\r\na. Your tsuba does not show this (nor does one I have that is signed Tosa M=\r\nyochin). When I see the surface decoration as is in your tsuba, I must admi=\r\nt it shoots me to Nishigaki group. Interesting to compare this treatment of=\r\n the various Higo groups illustrated in Sasano&#39;s books. \n\nExciting tsuba, a=\r\nll!!  Again, sorry for the incomplete earlier email. \n\nRon\nSTL\n  ----- Orig=\r\ninal Message ----- \n  From: Richard Turner \n  To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.=\r\ncom \n  Sent: Thursday, May 13, 2004 7:53 AM\n  Subject: [nihontostudy] Re: A=\r\nkasaka Tsuba redux\n\n\n  Hey Ron, thanks for that, I can see the layers on th=\r\ne inside of the\n  nakago ana, but I am not seeing any bones in the mimi. I =\r\nhad not\n  considered either Higo or Nishigaki, why points yo uin that direc=\r\ntion\n  ?. My thoughts towards Tosa My=F4chin are based on the the iron plat=\r\ne.\n  It is almost identical to this guard in the way the plate has been for=\r\nged.\n\n  http://members.westnet.com.au/whiz/richard/pics/Tsuba/kuniyoshi-fro=\r\nnt.jpg\n\n  Thanks again for your help.\n\n  Rich\n\n\n\n\n  --- In nihontostudy@yah=\r\noogroups.com, &quot;Ron Hartmann&quot; &lt;swords@u...&gt; wrote:\n  &gt; Hi Rich - \n  &gt; \n  &gt; Y=\r\nes, nice tsuba. It definitely is kiri, not wysteria motif. If\n  Akasaka I w=\r\nould expect to see some linear &quot;bones&quot; in the edge of the\n  tsuba from fold=\r\ning. I can see Akasaka or as you said, Tosa Myochi...or\n  dare I say Higo, =\r\nNishigaki work perhaps?
