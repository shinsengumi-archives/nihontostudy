There is a lot of material that is in circulation among friends and at clubs.  For example, our own Tom Helm made a nice videotape of an NTHK group visit to a swordsmith in Kamakura.  I got a VHS copy from Tom and have shown the tape at our NY shibu meeting and loaned it out to friends.  That&#39;s all very good, but the material hasn&#39;t traveled as far or freely as it could. \n\nAn online or disc-based way to distribute this stuff would not only make more of the existing material, but would also create an incentive to make the effort to record more.  We haven&#39;t taped Gordon&#39;s lectures for example.  If the tape is only going to circulate between a few friends, it&#39;s not too motivating to take the time to do it.  OTOH, if we know that there&#39;s a place for it on the web there&#39;s a much bigger motivation to capture it.  \n\nI don&#39;t think that the old model of selling a video for $39.95 (or a lot more) will go anywhere.  If it can be put online or sold for a few bucks or as part of membership dues on disc it&#39;ll have an audience.  Not a money maker, but a way to distribute information.\n\nJim\n\n\n\n  I too would be happy to offer any help in translating vision from Video/Film to CD/DVD. We have all the technology in my office and with all permissions I would offer this for nothing ( except maybe the stock/disk cost, this could be worked out somehow ) if interested.\n\n  This is a very good idea. To see Yumoto sensei in the flesh would be great, especially for those of us who know of him only in his books.\n\n  Rich Turner\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
