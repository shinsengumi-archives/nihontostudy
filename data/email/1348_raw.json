The \nconstruction of a copper core sandwiched between thin gold layers and \nfinished with a fukurin is not that unusual.  It&#39;s seen in Momoyama \nperiod Ko-Kinko work for example, often with wave and floating mon \nmotifs.  Most of these are not as high relief as yours and are \nusually not so crisply carved.  The shape of the hitsu-ana and the \ngeneral workmanship of this one seem more in line with the Edo \nperiod.  Of course the hitsu-ana could have been enlarged later and \nrelined with gold.\n&gt; \n&gt; The Genroku period was the next point in time when this kind of \ndisplay was in style.  My guess is that your guard is from that time  \nIt doesn&#39;t look very late to me.  It could possibly be earlier than \nGenroku.  Hard to say more without seeing it.  \n&gt; \n&gt; Jim\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   http://tinyurl.com/3cmud\n&gt; \n\nthank you, Jim, -t und Cary  for the insight.\nGlad it is not a Yokohama special.......\nI will submit this for the NTHK Chicago 04 shinsa.\n\nMilt\n\n\n\n"
