As \n&gt; Soumin studied under Goto masters and was one of the founders of \n&gt; Machibori I find it interesting he here is using the open/closed end \n&gt; posts such as the mainline Goto masters often used.  Having come \n&gt; across an article by Thomas B. Buttweiler, &#39;The History of Pre-Edo \n&gt; Menuki&#39;, Token TaiKai 1976, on pp. 62 & 63 the following is noted:\n&gt;\n&gt;      &quot;By the end of the Dolmen Period the Tsuka ornaments had been \n&gt; modified to function as Mekugi.  Because of the constraints placed on \n&gt; Menuki, the size was reduced and the design became rounded and more \n&gt; compact.  These first Menuki were made to be an integral part of the \n&gt; Mekugi.  The solid pin of one Menuki extended through the Mekugi-Ana \n&gt; of the sword and was capped on the other side of the Tsuka by the \n&gt; hollow cylindrical pin of the matching Menuki.  This hollow-solid \n&gt; cylindrical arrangement remained standard in the Goto School for five \n&gt; hundred years after the Menuki ceased to be an integral part of the \n&gt; Mekugi.\n&gt;\n&gt;      By the end of the Nara Period the wrapped Tsuka came into common \n&gt; use.  This inovation sounded the death knell of the integral Mekugi-\n&gt; Menuki.  Since the tight wrapping allowed virtually no space between \n&gt; adjacent turns, the Mekugi-Menuki had to be mounted over the Tsuka-\n&gt; Ito.  The softness of the wrap allowed the pins to move relative to \n&gt; one another.  The subsequent metal to metal wear, resulted in loss of \n&gt; adhesion, with the possible disappearance of one Menuki.  An \n&gt; alternate method of external mounting was attempted.  This consisted \n&gt; of mounting the two Menuki on an independent wooden Mekugi.  The \n&gt; mounting was accomplished using a hollow cylindrical pin in each \n&gt; Menuki, to fit over the Mekugi proper.  This approach was doomed to \n&gt; failure for the same reasons stated earlier.  The double hollow \n&gt; cylindrical pin arrangement, remained as a vestige of this mounting \n&gt; technique, until the Muromachi Period, in the Ezo School.\n&gt;\n&gt;      These two attempts at using externally mounted Menuki, either \n&gt; attached to or made part of the Mekugi, can only be classed as \n&gt; transitional.  From a functional standpoint they were doomed to \n&gt; failure from the onset.\n&gt;\n&gt;      Even though the Menuki could not be mounted as part of the \n&gt; mekugi, tradition dictated that the Menuki be retained.  They were \n&gt; inserted under the wraps using the rather feeble justifiaction that \n&gt; their use improved the warriors grip on the sword.\n&gt;\n&gt;      Aside from the debate over the dubious functionality of wrapped \n&gt; Menuki, they had, by the end of the Heian Period, become an \n&gt; established member of the compliment of Kodogu.  Their status has \n&gt; remained, except for variation of motif, unchanged up to the present \n&gt; day&quot;.\n&gt;\n&gt;      I still have to wonder if there is a known justification for the \n&gt; inclusion of this arrangement or if it is simply a nod to tradition?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt; Yahoo!
