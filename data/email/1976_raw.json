Purchased in Tampa several years ago, it later went to a friend who yesterday, traded it back to me. The kozuka shows good &quot;wear/age&quot; and good shakudo color. I&#39;ve considered this &quot;ko-kinko&quot; work dating perhaps to Momoyama era, thereabout. The kozuka has been constructed by soldering (?) the face half to the back half, which is (I believe) different than most (later?) kozuka. The photos show the kozuka face and then, a close-up of this &quot;seam&quot; which can be seen quite clearly around the side of the kozuka. \n\nMy question is this. First, does this indeed look &quot;ko-kinko&quot; work? Is this type of construction indicative of ko-kinko age kozuka? What can be said about this construction (other than that perhaps the maker lacked enough skill to make this seam less obvious)? \n\nIf the link to my Yahoo photo album Ron STL does not work, contact me and I&#39;ll email the photos to you.  \n\nhttp://tinyurl.com/2ccjz\n\nRon\nSTL\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
