He has 14 Kokuho and 25 Juyo Bijutsuhin described.\nThis was a particular area of interest of the late Jim Kurrasch and he\npublished something on his web site at\nhttp://members.cox.net/jkk/misimpor.htm  Not all of the items that Yamanaka\nmentioned are on Jim&#39;s site.\n\nWhat exactly is she looking for?\n\nJim\n  ----- \n\n\n  Hi all,\n\n\n\n  I&#39;ve had a request from a mom helping with a school project concerning the\n  missing NTs from after WWII. She would like to know what is on the list.\n  Anyone got a copy somewhere?\n\n\n\n  Gordon\n\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYahoo!
