I have more questions\nthough :-)\n \nI just posted this on the other list as well.......... do you or any\nother members of this list have insights in to this ?\n \nthanks, Matthew\n \nFriends,\n \nAnother concept I just ran into was that of hot or cold shortening of\nblades. If a blade is shortened &quot;hot&quot; the hamon will end where the tang\nbegins whereas if it is shortened &quot;cold&quot; the hamon will continue into\nthe nakago of the suriage or osuriage sword in question. \n \nNow it never occored to me there would be two ways to shorten a blade,\nalthough now ofcourse it looks quite obvious. However I am wondering,\npresuming actually, that a smith would carry out the &quot;hot&quot; shortening,\nnot the cold shortening of a blade. I don&#39;t know why but that seems to\nmake more sense to me........ \n \nSo who would shorten a blade &quot;cold&quot; and what advantages or disadvancages\nwould that have over shortening a blade &quot;hot&quot; ? Would it be possible to\ngeneralize and say that one technique was used more in one period than\nthe other ? \n \nAlso when the machi are moved up on a blade would this be done hot or\ncold ? \n \nJust curious,\n \nMatthew\n \n\n\n    Z Recruiting Services\n    &quot;Zurich Toren&quot; Muzenstraat 89\n    2511 WB Den Haag\n    T: +31 70 4262273\n    F: +31 70 4262111\n    W: zrecruiting.com\n    E: info@...\n    Kijk ook op monsterboard.nl, jobbingmall.nl en \n    nationalevacaturebank.nl voor actuele vacatures!\n\n \n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
