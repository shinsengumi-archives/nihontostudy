I can&#39;t remember\nwhat I had read about it, but I think this was the\ncombo of the mekugi-ana and the menuki, but overtime\nthe menuki and peg seperated and served different\nroles.  ok I took a stab at it, now someone can\ncorrect what I said.

I am doing some research into Goto\n&gt; School and I noticed \n&gt; that on early menuki often the posts are different\n&gt; -- one is open ended \n&gt; and the other closed over.  Does anyone know the\n&gt; reason for this?  I am \n&gt; wondering if they were actually used for mekugi and\n&gt; the one projection \n&gt; has been shortened having interlocked with the other\n&gt; originally.\n&gt; Thanks much!\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?
