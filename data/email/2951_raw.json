He makes great sukashi tsuba.  Price in the 5K to 8K range.  =\r\nHe had a number of his tsuba on display, very nice work.\n\nThere are people =\r\nin the US and in Japan that can do restoration on iron tsuba, and I have ha=\r\nd some restored in both the US and in Japan.  \n\nI am not certain on kinko a=\r\ns I have never had one done.\n\nJohn\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: =\r\nRichard Turner \n  To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Wednesday, May =\r\n11, 2005 11:52 PM\n  Subject: [nihontostudy] here&#39;s probably a really stupid=\r\n question\n\n\n  but I have been know to ask plenty of these in my life so why=\r\n stand on \n  ceremony now :-).\n\n  I was looking at some pitting that is on =\r\na new tsuba I picked\n  ( either Akasaka or Tosa Myochin I think - \n  http:/=\r\n/www.nihontomessageboard.com/personal/tsuba/akasaka2.jpg )\n  and it has a b=\r\nit more pitting than I thought from the auction images \n  which is a shame.=\r\n\n\n  My question for the day then is, if we polish and restore pittings, \n  =\r\nscratches, chips and the likes from swords, is anything like this ever \n  d=\r\none on iron tsuba ?, I know the obvious thing is the patina but if we \n  ca=\r\nn re patinate nakago, why not tsuba ( at least iron tsuba anyway ) and \n  a=\r\nre there any artisans in Japan presently making tsuba in the old ways \n  an=\r\nd using original patina recipes ?. I know Yoshindo Yoshihara sensei \n  does=\r\n apparently, and I would love to see some examples of his work. I \n  was th=\r\ninking about this recently, and wondered about the recipes in the \n  back o=\r\nf the Aesthetic Guide and if anyone still does this stuff. If so, \n  could =\r\nvery good tsuba with minimal damage be repaired and re patinate \n  and if s=\r\no, how effectively.\n\n  Right then, foot back in my mouth and over to the ex=\r\nperts.\n\n  cheers\n\n  Rich Turner\n\n\n  -- \n\n  Richard Turner\n  Nihont=F4 Messa=\r\nge Board\n  &lt;http://members5.boardhost.com/Nihon-To/&gt;\n  - /for the discussio=\r\nn and sharing of all things Nihont=F4/\n\n\n\n\n\n  [Non-text portions of this me=\r\nssage have been removed]\n\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------=\r\n-------------------------------\n  Yahoo!
