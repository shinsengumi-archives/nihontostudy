Tell us more......\n\nThanks Jim, I guess the Mimi was what threw me, though my Tadatoki \nmokume tsuba&#39;s mimi is as square as my last assistant, and that&#39;s \nsquare. I think the sharpness of the sukashi is Akasaka-ish, as is the \ndesign as a whole. I thought Akao because of it&#39;s overall boldness and \nthe fact that they were copying Akasaka along with Tosa Myochin and visa \nversa at the later stages of the Edo period.\n\nThough, from the photo&#39;s, I would think this a bit older than late Edo ?.\n\nCheers\n\nRich\n\nJim Gilbert wrote:\n\n&gt; Curran,\n&gt; Number 482 was a Myochin tsuba with a circular cross section rim and a \n&gt; design of two large diamond shapes at 12:00 and 6:00.  That&#39;s the only \n&gt; thing similar in your group.  I know the owner, so I&#39;m guessing it&#39;s \n&gt; the one you&#39;re thinking of.\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;ve seen the spiral motif used on a guard signed Tadatoki, and as \n&gt; Rich said the insect is often seen in Akasaka sukashi.  I don&#39;t think \n&gt; Akasaka is a bad call.\n&gt;\n&gt; Rich, what&#39;s putting you off Akasaka?\n&gt;\n&gt; Back to the Yagyu,\n&gt; Jim\n&gt;\n\n-- \n*Richard Turner - Nihonto Message Board*\n/for the discussion of all things Nihonto./\nwww.nihontomessageboard.com &lt;http://www.nihontomessageboard.com/nmb/&gt;\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
