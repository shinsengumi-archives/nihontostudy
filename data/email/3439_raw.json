Myself, I actually think it is pretty awesome from what I&#39;ve seen, and Im considering getting          on there later on this evening. If you don&#39;t know what it is, basically its like a matchingplace, but has few added things I noticed. Stuff like messenger, vidchat, picsrate, etc. Best part is you can talk to ppl on vidchat even if you don&#39;t have it enabled yourself. \n\n"
