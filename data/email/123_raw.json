But generically, the source for tamahagane is\njust that, a type of black sand.  Most all beach sands contain some black\nsand consisting of magnetite, chemically Fe3O4, containing iron in both the\n+2 and +3 oxidation states.  As the name implies, it is magnetic, and simply\nby running a magnet through beach sand, you will collect the magnetite\ngrains.  A great concentrating method that was likely not available to the\nJapanese before cheap magnets became available in the modern age.  They used\na water flow ripple method instead (sluice box), not as efficient.  I\nimagine that the traditional Japanese used sand from the few places where\nmagnetite was a major fraction of the sand total, giving the bulk sand an\noverall &quot;black&quot; look.  But where those beaches and stream beds were exactly,\nI&#39;ll have to leave to someone else to tell.  Kapp does mention Shimane\nProvince as the major source of tamahagane (80% of total) from the late\nMuromachi onward, but doesn&#39;t specify the koto era sources, except that they\nwere scattered.  Note: Kapp also indicates the source of tamahagane as\nFe2O3, but this is hematite, a red color as the name implies.  It is indeed\na good iron source, but not what was available to the Japanese, I believe.\n\nNC\n\n\n\n"
