Strange indeed.  \n\nI don&#39;t have that catalog, can you post the image?  I think I have already seen the same thing elsewhere, though.  Apparently pieces that are just &quot;of the school&quot; can get Hozon kanteisho, but I don&#39;t know the specific criteria used to separate these pieces from the run-of-the-mill late copies.  If I have the specific example I can follow up on it.\n\nJim\n\n\n\n  Jim, everybody,\n  The mounting is strange, the fittings are very old, the kurikata and fuchi\n  are made of thin metal with the nanako almost worn away, the inlay looks\n  like uttori with a &#39;trench&#39; around each piece but the gold is not worn as I\n  would expect, you can easily tell uttori when you can see the gaps in the\n  gold inlay, this inlay is perfect. One thought I have is that the kashira\n  was originally the kojiri, I feel the shape would make more sense this way.\n  Altogether a puzzling item. There is no bare wood visible.\n  Regarding another tsuba, if you have Sotheby&#39;s London catalogue of 11\n  November lot 27 is a Soten tsuba with a Hozon paper, the item is clearly\n  19th century and a long time after the 2nd Soten, any ideas?\n  Alan\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
