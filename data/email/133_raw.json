What makes Oyamazumi so interesting is that the early swords and armor preserved there were practical items that were in use before being given to the shrine.  Many of the blades are full of chips and pits and most of the koshirae are very simple and/or in degraded condition.  These are pieces are rare remainders of what was for the most part used up and discarded long ago.\n\nJim\n\n\n  Jim et all, were these piece made for shrines or something simular ?\n\n  Rich\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
