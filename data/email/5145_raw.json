I should never have left the front check-in table......  But I \nagree with your statement about enjoying good company the whole weekend.  I \nenjoyed that most of all.\n\nI have a Kawai Hisayoshi in my lineage, but I&#39;m wondering if Hisayuki is \nthere also...  I have a family scroll that shows my family history dating \nback to around the beginning of the Heian Period which states that I am \ndescended from Taira Kiyomori.  I&#39;m bringing it to club meeting because I \ntalked to Fred at the show and want some clarification about what it says.\n\nHas the club ever given out a questionaire/feedback form when someone \nregisters for a table?  Or maybe hand them out to people before the end of \nthe show to get feedback about the show and if we can improve on anything or \nany gripes they may have (including accomdations)?  This information could \nhelp us make the show even better.  Just thinking out loud...........\n\nMas\n\n&gt;From: Tom Helm &lt;toryu@...&gt;\n&gt;Reply-To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;Subject: [nihontostudy] IMG_3977.JPG\n&gt;Date: Mon, 20 Aug 2007 09:05:46 -0700\n&gt;\n&gt;Elliott et al-\n&gt;\tDespite light sales activity no one I talked to was disappointed\n&gt;with this years show. The tables were all full, unlike laste year\n&gt;when storms back east prevented some from attending. There were\n&gt;several Japanese with tables set up that had not been here in the\n&gt;recent past, Most notably Aoi Arts. There were exceptional swords,\n&gt;and lots of average blades though maybe not as many swords overall\n&gt;compared to last year. two things of note were the number of Gassan\n&gt;works for sale, there were a half dozen polished and papered pieces\n&gt;scattered through out the show room and a real chance to study\n&gt;Sadakazu, Sadakatsu and others. Also there were many more koshirae of\n&gt;exceptional quality and interest and I enjoyed quite a bit of my time\n&gt;pouring over these.\n&gt;\tThe NTHK presented the Swords and Fittings of Mino Province, the\n&gt;Naginata seen below is from that exhibit. The NBTHK did a\n&gt;presentation of Tanto, 13 total as I recall, from Awataguchi Hisakuni\n&gt;to Gassan Sadakazu. The Soshu Yukimitsu tanti which was number two on\n&gt;the table was my pick for best of show. There was a Soshu Hiromasa\n&gt;Otanto (kowakizashi) in the middle of the pack that was in an older\n&gt;polish which was a bit scuffed up but this did not prevent one from\n&gt;seeing the quality, a fine example of the period and not the kind of\n&gt;koto we usually see around here.\n&gt;\tThere was an NBTHK Kantei-kai as well. With a Yosozaemon Suksada\n&gt;yoroidoshi and a Kawai Hisayuki katana being the stand-outs. The\n&gt;Kawai blade was presented by the First Japanese Ambassadors to the US\n&gt;to their American chaperone and it is still held in the same family.\n&gt;A real treasure.\n&gt;\tI bought some books as one might expect, sold very few that I\n&gt;brought with me but I learned lots and enjoyed good company all\n&gt;weekend. I am sure we&#39;ll here more from others as they get back to\n&gt;their homes from way out west...\n&gt;-t\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   ----------\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;IMG_3977.JPG\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nSee what you�re getting into�before you go there \nhttp://newlivehotmail.com/?ocid=TXT_TAGHM_migration_HM_viral_preview_0507\n\n\n"
