All good to \nknow and =\r\nremember.  I would imagine, too, that the particular period \none is conside=\r\nring would play a role, too, no?  I guess I would \nexpect that even Owari i=\r\nron would be less &quot;worked,&quot; less &quot;dramatic&quot; \nwith the coming of the Edo per=\r\niod...  \n\nOn the weight of the Nobuiye, yes, if the plate is considerably \n=\r\nthinner than the rim, I could see where the tsuba wouldn&#39;t be quite \nas hea=\r\nvy as it appears at first glance.  Interesting thoughts, too, \non Nobuiye b=\r\neing the first to develop heavier guards.  Is it correct \nto suppose that t=\r\nhe shift to the &quot;two-hand swords&quot; at the time of \nNobuiye might have been i=\r\nnfluential...?  Thanks again, Jim.\n\nSteven\n\n\n--- In nihontostudy@yahoogroup=\r\ns.com, &quot;Jim Gilbert&quot; &lt;jggilbert@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Steven,\n&gt; Even though the =\r\nrim is thick, the plate itself is fairly thin, so \nit&#39;s not as heavy as you=\r\n might think.   Compared to earlier sukashi \nand ita tsuba though, it is he=\r\navy.  Nobuie was probably the first to \nmake heavier guards, but I&#39;d have t=\r\no think about that a bit more.\n&gt; \n&gt; Regarding Owari iron, go back through t=\r\nhe previous kantei two \nalbums and as a group consider the metal, hammer wo=\r\nrk, tekkotsu \nand &quot;melted&quot; finish.  These are all typical of early Owari ar=\r\nea \nwork.  Also this album about tekkotsu\n&gt; http://ph.groups.yahoo.com/grou=\r\np/nihontostudy/photos/browse/d4b0 \nare all Owari region.\n&gt; \n&gt; By comparison=\r\n Kyoto iron has a softer look to it, more homogenous, \nshows less modulatio=\r\nn in the hammering, generally does not show \nprominent tekkotsu or a melted=\r\n finish (although some Ko-Shoami will \nhave this).  Some would say more ref=\r\nined, others would say more \nboring.  Think Kyo-sukashi, Heianjo, Onin, Kan=\r\neie, etc.  Usually it \nis more of a brown color rather than blue-black of O=\r\nwari (all \ncaveats about color in effect).\n&gt; \n&gt; It&#39;s probably not possible =\r\nto explain without examples in hand, \nbut try to look carefully at the phot=\r\nos.  Even with examples in hand \nit takes some years of effort to see.\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n Jim\n&gt;   ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt;   From: steven \n&gt;   To: nihontostu=\r\ndy@yahoogroups.com \n&gt;   Sent: Sunday, March 19, 2006 9:31 PM\n&gt;   Subject: [=\r\nnihontostudy] Re: tsuba kantei 3 setsumei\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   Marvelous tsuba, Jim.  =\r\nI hadn&#39;t realized the piece was so \nlarge.
