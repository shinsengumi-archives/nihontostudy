The plate is consistent with late Hoan work that I have seen.  I&#39;m not sure what to make of the cut cross hatching above the sukashi design.  It looks more like an irregular basketwork pattern than a nunome ground.\n\nJim\n\n\n\n  Just got the Jan 05 NCJSC &quot;To-Ron&quot; and have a question\n  about the tsuba at the bottom of page 3 - the Ho bird over\n  paulownia.\n\n  What school is this? The elongated hitsu-ana and other work\n  makes me think Saotome. What appears to be the acid etched\n  design makes me think Hoan but Saotome also did that style\n  work.\n\n  I wish the publisher would be sure to include translations\n  and/or attributions for all the photos in To-Ron. It would\n  really be very helpful.\n\n  Rich S\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
