Actually, I think you should\ndo as David said and invest in a book or 2.  It is\npersonal, what you like is what you like- collect\nthat.  There are many collections out there- same\nschool, similiar design, certain periods of time,\ntypes of construction, and so on and so on.  I would\nalso agree profit should not be the motivating factor,\ntoo many guys will tell you their stories of losses.  \n\nFor me I had a connection with the mantis and built my\ncollection around that motif.  I like finding the\nrenditions of the bug from the various schools and\ntime periods.  It also helps me sort through the many\navailable items for sale.  That is my personal taste. \nMilt I think took his love of hawk paintings and that\ntransferred over into his tsuba collection, although,\nhe doesn&#39;t stick to just that motif.  \n\nGain some basic knowledge 1st.  It will help you to\navoid buying mistakes and also help you put together a\nbetter collection if that is your desire.  \n\nOne of the nice things about fittings is that you\ndon&#39;t have to spend thousands to get something decent.\n However, you can spend $40,000 if you want/can.  I am\nimpressed with their artistic qualities.  I don&#39;t have\na mentor really and I haven&#39;t handled as much as I\nwould like, but I am slowly learning.  I would love to\nsit down with someone more knowledgeable and be shown\niron quality.  Jim G. said all it takes is handling a\nfew thousand tsuba.  \n\nGood luck.\nKen\n\n\n\n\n\n--- Anthony H &lt;anwahi@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; Ken,\n&gt;    \n&gt;   Good info. Not sure whether to take it that this\n&gt; Kurt guy is a fraud or he has two inch thick glasses\n&gt; and can&#39;t tell the bugs apart.\n&gt;    \n&gt;   Might be a simple question, but what is kinko or\n&gt; sukashi? \n&gt;    \n&gt;   From reading what you said, is the Mantis design\n&gt; highly sought after or maybe you can tell what are\n&gt; the best designs are to collect? I&#39;m sure a lot is\n&gt; personal tastes, but the question is more for what\n&gt; will hold value and easily be resold.\n&gt;    \n&gt;   Thanks,\n&gt;   Anthony\n&gt; \n&gt; Kenneth Wilson &lt;kdw21620@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;   Anthony,\n&gt; \n&gt; I also have purchased from Rich&#39;s sources (he is a\n&gt; sukashi tsuba slut by the way).  In addition I have\n&gt; purchased from Ron.  I would purchase from all of\n&gt; them\n&gt; again.  Many tsuba are not papered, it is not worth\n&gt; the cost of many to put them through shinsa.  Since\n&gt; it\n&gt; is much harder to attribute to a particular smith,\n&gt; you\n&gt; will also be likely to get a paper to a general\n&gt; school\n&gt; (for the unsigned ones).  There are all price\n&gt; points.\n&gt; \n&gt; The only one I have not purchased from is that Kurt\n&gt; Holtz dude.  The major reason is that he tries to\n&gt; pass\n&gt; off crickets as preying mantises.  As if I don&#39;t\n&gt; know\n&gt; the difference.  Gets me all excited in searching\n&gt; ebay\n&gt; and have a hit other than the Chen crappers and it\n&gt; turns out to be a waste.  Even mentions me by name,\n&gt; like he couldn&#39;t just email me. \n&gt; \n&gt; Be careful buying books, especially those japanese\n&gt; ones.  They are addicting in their own right and\n&gt; then\n&gt; you end up with all these books you can&#39;t read.  Of\n&gt; course, if you can read them, I will tell you which\n&gt; ones to buy and you can translate them for me.  \n&gt; \n&gt; Remember tsuba are 2 sided, if one sided don&#39;t buy\n&gt; or\n&gt; if already purchased certainly don&#39;t email list that\n&gt; you baught a 1 sided tsuba (I love to bring this\n&gt; incident up makes me still laugh- happened to a list\n&gt; member a few years ago).  Milt can give you a\n&gt; dissertation on how to buy on ebay.  Tom Helm can\n&gt; also\n&gt; tell you why those tsuba&#39;s recommended by Milt suck.\n&gt; \n&gt; Actually I have gotten a few off ebay over the years\n&gt; and prices are usually good.  Just don&#39;t buy\n&gt; anything\n&gt; from China, unless from a pilot living in Hong Kong\n&gt; but he only cares about hizen (he gets touchy about\n&gt; condemning all of china- basically don&#39;t buy from\n&gt; the\n&gt; billion or so people minus one).\n&gt; \n&gt; Ok, I put a lot of list history in this post and\n&gt; most\n&gt; likely you have no idea of the stories behind them,\n&gt; but I am reminiscing.  Buy some books and find some\n&gt; collectors to handle tsuba.  Some like kinko some\n&gt; like\n&gt; sukashi, some like both.\n&gt; \n&gt; You can always ask questions here.   Just remember\n&gt; that any preying mantis themed tsuba and/or sword\n&gt; fittings must be cheaply sold to me.  Milt keeps on\n&gt; trying to sell me stuff at full retail when I know\n&gt; he\n&gt; got them cheap, plus I am originally from NY and we\n&gt; don&#39;t pay retail!  He complains about son&#39;s tuition\n&gt; at\n&gt; BU and I keep telling him, I went to Grad school\n&gt; there\n&gt; and they aren&#39;t getting anymore of my money.  Have\n&gt; fun!\n&gt; \n&gt; all the best,\n&gt; Ken aka &quot;the mantis dude&quot; a puveyor of all kamakiri\n&gt; tosogou\n&gt; \n&gt; --- Ron Hartmann &lt;swords@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Anthony - \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Sorry to sound like such a &quot;merchant&quot; but if\n&gt; you&#39;re\n&gt; &gt; interested I can send you some pictures of a very\n&gt; &gt; nice selection of good quality iron tsuba that I&#39;m\n&gt; &gt; selling. Most are $200 range, more or less. If you\n&gt; &gt; are new at this I would be happy to recommend good\n&gt; &gt; ones that would help teach you about these things.\n&gt; &gt; Some of these have been to a number of shows and\n&gt; are\n&gt; &gt; now kept home so that I can keep my table at the\n&gt; &gt; shows, fresh. All are authentic, for sure. The\n&gt; shows\n&gt; &gt; seem to have a wonderful selection of nice quality\n&gt; &gt; tsuba these days and that is good for the buyer,\n&gt; bad\n&gt; &gt; for the seller since there is such a &quot;selection&quot;\n&gt; to\n&gt; &gt; pick from. Anyway...just thought I&#39;d toss this\n&gt; idea\n&gt; &gt; out to you. I&#39;ve been around for going on 40\n&gt; &gt; years...gosh, that&#39;s a little frightening to put\n&gt; in\n&gt; &gt; writing! \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Ron\n&gt; &gt; STL\n&gt; &gt;   ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt; &gt;   From: anwahi \n&gt; &gt;   To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n&gt; &gt;   Sent: Wednesday, December 21, 2005 4:23 PM\n&gt; &gt;   Subject: [nihontostudy] Where do you buy your\n&gt; &gt; Tsuba?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   Hello,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   I&#39;m new here and to collecting Tsuba. Where do\n&gt; you\n&gt; &gt; buy your Tsuba from? \n&gt; &gt;   I know there&#39;s several websites you can find\n&gt; with\n&gt; &gt; a Google search, an \n&gt; &gt;   occasional Token Kai show like the one in SF, or\n&gt; &gt; Ebay (most look like \n&gt; &gt;   junk). I&#39;m looking for good sources of authentic\n&gt; &gt; Tsuba. Obviously the \n&gt; &gt;   only way to be really sure of authenticity is to\n&gt; &gt; purchase papered \n&gt; &gt;   Tsuba, but because I&#39;m starting off I want some\n&gt; &gt; sources of authentic \n&gt; &gt;   Tsuba more reasonably priced. Any suggestions?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   Thanks for your helpo in advance,\n&gt; &gt;   Anthony\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt;   YAHOO!
