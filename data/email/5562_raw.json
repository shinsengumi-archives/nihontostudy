I came to the conclusion a couple of\nyears ago that I can only do a good job selling books at the Chicago show -\ncoming up in just a month - and I&#39;ve put all my efforts into that show and\nmy website.\n\nAll these books do no good sitting in my stock, so I&#39;ve decided to offer an\nunprecedented 33% off sale through April 18th. Yes, in many cases, perhaps\nmost, that means I&#39;ll be selling for less than my cost, but I need the space\nand money, and you need the books.\n\nCheck my website, www.bridgeofdreams.com, and check back. I printed a\nlisting today of all the sword, sword fitting, and armor books I have which\naren&#39;t online, and it&#39;s hundreds. All those books are lined up or already in\nboxes to haul to the Chicago show, and I&#39;ll be adding them to the website\ndaily, but ask if you are looking for something not listed, or want some\nrecommendations on particular subjects.\n\nYou can order on the website using Visa/MasterCard/Amex/Discover or PayPal.\nYour card or account is never charged until I confirm the total including\nshipping, and I make a point of charging for shipping at my cost. I prefer\nto ship Priority Mail, but can use other carriers if you prefer. Email me or\ncall if you have questions.\n\nThanks for looking, and I&#39;m hoping to be of service!\n\nCraig Harris\nBridge of Dreams, LLC\nPark Ridge, IL USA\ncraigharris@...\no: 847 696-9774\nc: 847 846-7701\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
