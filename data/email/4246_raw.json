In the late-Edo  \nwhen they started reproducing old koshirae styles this type of mekugi  \nwas seen again but most often with a screw in feature.\n\tThe section on secret marks is nothing of the sort. As I understand  \nit, it is a detailed explanation of the chisel work seen in  \nindividual artists. It shows close ups of fine detail on toes,  \nfeathers, scales and claws, showing how some of the masters put the  \nfinishing touches on their work. If these marks are present and done  \nin a certain way you have evidence that it may be the work of a  \ncertain master. If they are not present then maybe you do not. They  \nare all visible however, not hidden in any way, one just has to  \nrecognize the workmanship.\n\tand before anybody asks, I haven&#39;t done more than browse thru it, I  \ndon&#39;t want to translate it and I don&#39;t know any secrets...\n-t\n\nOn May 28, 2006, at 9:55 AM, Ron Hartmann wrote:\n\n&gt; Hi -\n&gt;\n&gt; Honestly, I could never get too excited about the premise that  \n&gt; menuki posts were ever made to serve as mekugi except for what you  \n&gt; wrote, Barry, about early, early tsuba being rivited with the heads  \n&gt; decorated possibly being forerunners of menuki as we know them  \n&gt; today. But of course, I have no &quot;other&quot; explanation for the &quot;male/ \n&gt; female&quot; posts. I do find it interesting to note that the &quot;primary&quot;  \n&gt; menuki usually has the &quot;male/solid&quot; post whereas the &quot;secondary&quot;  \n&gt; menuki has the &quot;female/hollow&quot; post. (Primary one would be fitted  \n&gt; to the omote/outside of the tsuka; the secondary would be on the  \n&gt; ura side.) Make one wonder if perhaps there is some &quot;other&quot; meaning  \n&gt; behind the use of male/female menuki posts.\n&gt;\n&gt; As for the &quot;secret marks&quot; of Goto, I&#39;m not positive but it seems  \n&gt; Jim Gilbert remarked about this section of the book awhile back,  \n&gt; saying -- something like -- the idea of secret marks is not exactly  \n&gt; true. Hope I&#39;m not saying this incorrectly, but something like  \n&gt; that. I too, have always wondered about that section of the book in  \n&gt; hopes of &quot;learning the key to identifying Goto works! Maybe that  \n&gt; section just presents this idea in an overly simplified, general way?\n&gt;\n&gt; Ron\n&gt; STL\n&gt;   ----- Original Message -----\n&gt;   From: Barry Thomas\n&gt;   To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;   Sent: Saturday, May 27, 2006 8:00 AM\n&gt;   Subject: Re: [nihontostudy] Menuki Posts\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   Blokes,\n&gt;\n&gt;   The story I remember is that menuki are vestigial ornaments from  \n&gt; pre-Heian times\n&gt;   when the tsuka was fixed to the nakago with a rivet that was not  \n&gt; removable.  The\n&gt;   heads of the rivet were decorated and eventually became the  \n&gt; menuki we know\n&gt;   today.  What I did not know until these emails is that some  \n&gt; menuki have\n&gt;   &quot;interlocking pins&quot; to become mekugi.  Sure, I&#39;ve seen these on  \n&gt; cheap Meiji\n&gt;   pieces, especially tanto, but didn&#39;t know early Goto menuki had  \n&gt; the same\n&gt;   feature.  We can clearly see that as the Nihonto developed from  \n&gt; earliest times\n&gt;   the disadvantage of a fixed rivet became evident, but the early  \n&gt; menuki discussed\n&gt;   appear to have still functioned as a mekugi, only later becoming  \n&gt; separate with a\n&gt;   bamboo mekugi, or mekugi of other material (iron??).  I also  \n&gt; remember that in\n&gt;   the Momoyama period a single menuki was used, accounting for some  \n&gt; of the\n&gt;   &quot;orphans&quot; we see.  Looking back over my collecting career I think  \n&gt; I once had a\n&gt;   single (i.e., never a pair) shakudo menuki of a pomegranate.  It  \n&gt; was of that\n&gt;   really dark black shakudo.  Sometimes knowledge comes too late to  \n&gt; save us from\n&gt;   ourselves!!!\n&gt;\n&gt;   Ken, I do have somewhere a late 19th century English treatise on  \n&gt; the Goto\n&gt;   mainline (Shirobei 17 generations) with photos, but it doesn&#39;t go  \n&gt; into the\n&gt;   &quot;secret marks&quot;...  Does anyone know the title of the Japanese one  \n&gt; that Ken\n&gt;   mentions??\n&gt;\n&gt;   Regards,\n&gt;\n&gt;   Barry Thomas.\n&gt;\n&gt;   ----- Original Message -----\n&gt;   From: &quot;Kenneth Wilson&quot; &lt;kdw21620@...&gt;\n&gt;   To: &lt;nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt;   Sent: Sunday, May 28, 2006 12:34 AM\n&gt;   Subject: Re: [nihontostudy] Menuki Posts\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   Yes, I believe that at one point the menuki where\n&gt;   &quot;interlocking&quot; with each other, at least on some\n&gt;   styles of sword mounting design.  I can&#39;t remember\n&gt;   what I had read about it, but I think this was the\n&gt;   combo of the mekugi-ana and the menuki, but overtime\n&gt;   the menuki and peg seperated and served different\n&gt;   roles.  ok I took a stab at it, now someone can\n&gt;   correct what I said.  Would love an english\n&gt;   translation  of the 17 generations of goto (can&#39;t\n&gt;   remember japanese tittle) in which all the secret\n&gt;   marks are revealed.\n&gt;   Ken\n&gt;\n&gt;   --- klepet33319 &lt;Ppeterdds@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;   &gt; Hello all.  I am doing some research into Goto\n&gt;   &gt; School and I noticed\n&gt;   &gt; that on early menuki often the posts are different\n&gt;   &gt; -- one is open ended\n&gt;   &gt; and the other closed over.
