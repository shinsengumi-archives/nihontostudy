Do your answers mean that \n&gt; you don&#39;t quite agree with Sasano-sensei&#39;s advice regarding \ncleaning \n&gt; of the sukashi openings?  Or is it that his advice here \nis &quot;dated&quot;?  \n&gt; Forgive my ignorance here... :o).  Thanks again!\n&gt; \n&gt; Steve\n\nhi Steve,\nPersonally, I only clean the opening IF the rust distort the outline \nof the design but don&#39;t overdo it..........if in doubt  best to leave \nit alone.\nAnother issue is &quot; waxing &quot; the tsuba.\nI&#39;ve heard many conflicting views on that............I suspect a lot \nof people do that to give their tsuba that lustrous moist look, but \nof course few will admit to that.\nI have outbid a well known /knowledgable dealer on a can of old \njapanese tsuba wax on e-bay........question is if the advance people \npoo poo on waxing the tsuba then why he placed a bid ?\n\nNaturally you guys will ask if I wax my  tsuba.........hahahaa,  yes \nand no. I used to  but I found out the wax does wear off so the \neffect of the lustre is not permanent. I discovered a better way now, \nno, it&#39;s not wearing it in your rear pocket (  for the SF residents ).\n\nmilt \n\n\n\n"
