Meaning they are not as hard as one intended to take \nan edge. I have noted that symmetrically design swords &quot;sing&quot; with a \nclear ringing tone  when impacted, even when done gently, and that \nasymmetrical ones like our katana and wakizashi do not. These instead \nproduce a flat &quot;clat&quot; like note.\n\nNon of the ten Japanese weapons we have had made &quot;sing&quot;, much the same \nas iaito and I presumed, that this was due to their asymmetry, which is \nwhat I have been giving in answer to the question at our public shows \n&quot;why don&#39;t your swords ring like in the movies?&quot; I&#39;ve always thought \nthat the ringing tones in Japanese movies was a dubbed in sound effect, \nrather than a true representation of the weapon&#39;s own nature.\n\nFor a very long time now I have been wondering if this is incorrect, and \nit is due to our weapons lack of hardness not their asymmetry. Our \ncurrent Japanese weapons tend to be in the Rockwell scale between 52-54.\n\nAs collectors of true nihonto, can you confirm or deny this point: do \nnihonto &quot;sing&quot; when struck? And no, I&#39;m not expecting anyone to actually \ntry this on a historical weapon:-)\n\nFor our next project, a moderately sized no-dachi, I am approaching a \nnew sword smith (our old one recently passed away), and I am considering \nraising the hardness to circa 56-58 or maybe 60, to improve resistance \nto damage, and possibly gaining a sweeter note from the blade, assuming \nthat my former hypothesis is in fact incorrect.\n\nIt would be good to have a definitive answer to this question, as it \nwould be better than having to say that &quot;currently, we don&#39;t know&quot;. \nFilling in gaps in one&#39;s knowledge is always a good thing.\n\nAny help, observations etc., would be most warmly received.\n\nWith much thanks\n\nDean\n\n-- \nDean Wayland\nHead Of The Fight School\nhttp://www.thefightschool.demon.co.uk\n\n\n"
