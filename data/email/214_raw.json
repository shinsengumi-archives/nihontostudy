Specifically, the &quot;blade&quot; of the kogai has several not &quot;nicks&quot; to its edge which are sad to see but I would guess, repairable.  Have any of you had repairs done on shakudo kodogu like this before?  \n\nThe kozuka has a couple spots of patina damage (fingerprinting?) on its backside which would seem, could be gently fixed; the patina blended in, let&#39;s say.  Here my question refers to the nanako.  It has what I first considered to be simply &quot;wear&quot; to the nanako.  Looking closer, I suspect the nanako has become smooth in places not from wear, but from clogging caused by oily dirt.  I&#39;m curious if any of you have found a &quot;safe&quot; way to remove this oily dirt buildup.  \n\nRon\nSTL\n\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
