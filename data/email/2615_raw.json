Ergo they were &#39;hardly&#39; put in and when they were they\nwere quite different in shape from the ones in the Edo period. More\nelongated and oval, in the Edo period they are more &quot;standardized&quot; and all\nlook a bit the same.\n\nA forger in the 19th cent like for example one of the Norisuke guys might\nnot have thought about this and put in modern looking hitsu ana out of\nhabit. The hitsu ana added to the genuine Nobuiye would probably have been\nadded after manufacture, but still much earlier than the 19th cent (maybe\nbeginning edo period) and would therefore look different.\n\nOr am I being ridiculous here?\n\nMatt\n\n\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &quot;arnold frenzel&quot; &lt;afrenzel@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;matthewhoyle@...&gt;; &lt;nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Monday, January 31, 2005 7:05 PM\nSubject: Re: [nihontostudy] Gimei Nobuiye?\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi:\n&gt;  At first glance it does look rather nice, however the mei looks\n&gt; tentative, soft and not quite right to me. The first thing one would\n&gt; what to do is to consult the book of Akiyama collected Nobuiye (title\n&gt; escapes me without reference material here) which illustrates the vast\n&gt; bulk of know Nobuiye out there. A few years ago a well known California\n&gt; dealer was lucky enough to find one at a show, bought it and it\n&gt; eventually went Juyo. Sure enough is found among the Akiyama oshigata.\n&gt; You can be quite sure that if such a tsuba left Japan and were correct\n&gt; the price would have at least another zero on the end, and probably an\n&gt; initial digit change as well.\n&gt;  Arnold\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; matthewhoyle@... 01/30/05 5:32 PM &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Gimei Nobuiye?\n&gt;\n&gt; http://www.nihonto.com/11.28.04.html\n&gt;\n&gt; Mr. Weissberg evidently thinks it is gimei, my question is how can you\n&gt; tell?\n&gt; It looks awfully similar to the ones in the books!\n&gt;\n&gt; And if it is indeed gimei, how old is it do we think?\n&gt;\n&gt; Matt\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
