I would not call this Kaga work, more likely Yoshiro or simply Heianjo zogan (if not Yoshiro). The kogai hitsuana looks very Kyoto to me. I also think Yoshiro work was &quot;outlined&quot; with chisel marks...not sure about that. (Maybe that was a way to distinguish between Yoshiro and Onin? Suspect Onin work was done that way.) Sorry to be sound so confusing here. Nice overlapping zogan...my guess is Yoshiro. \n\n  Ron\n  STL\n    ----- Original Message ----- \n    From: dirk marshall \n    To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n    Sent: Saturday, April 23, 2005 1:56 PM\n    Subject: [nihontostudy] yoshiro school tsuba?\n\n\n    I bought this with the other and got a good deal as they were rusty.  I was wondering if this could be a yoshino or kaga tsuba.  As you can see I don&#39;t know much other than what I like.  The inlay goes around and on the edge.  \n\n    http://www.freeimagelibrary.com/images/dirkmarshall/leaf.jpg&lt;http://www.freeimagelibrary.com/images/dirkmarshall/leaf.jpg&gt;&lt;http://www.freeimagelibrary.com/images/dirkmarshall/leaf.jpg&lt;http://www.freeimagelibrary.com/images/dirkmarshall/leaf.jpg&gt;&gt;\n\n    Thanks\n    Dirk\n\n    [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    Yahoo!
