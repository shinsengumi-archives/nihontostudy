I will try that tonight. Welcome \n  back and h=\r\nappy new year to you and the family.\n\n  another few for interest, the first=\r\n one, I have been getting indications \n  this is Namban maybe, I have no id=\r\nea hat the symbols are though Barry \n  Thomas says he has an almost identic=\r\nal tsuba catalogued in a book from \n  the early 1900&#39;s he is going to dig o=\r\nut for me.\n\n  Namban ?\n  http://members.westnet.com.au/whiz/richard/tsuba/s=\r\nymbol-tsuba-front.jpg\n  http://members.westnet.com.au/whiz/richard/tsuba/sy=\r\nmbol-tsuba-back.jpg\n\n  Akasaka. I am hoping early more so than later.

Dr. Robson tells me there is an exact same tsuba in \n  the book M=\r\nito katana to Tosogu no Meihin and thinks whilst the mei is a \n  little dif=\r\nferent, it could be the shodai or one of the students. I am \n  waiting to h=\r\nere if anyone has a copy of this or in fact, how much this \n  book is.\n  ht=\r\ntp://members.westnet.com.au/whiz/richard/tsuba/tomoyoshi.jpg\n  http://membe=\r\nrs.westnet.com.au/whiz/richard/tsuba/tomoyoshi-mei.jpg\n\n  thanks for the ba=\r\nnd width.\n\n  Rich\n\n\n\n  Richard Turner\n  Nihont=F4 Message Board\n  &lt;http://m=\r\nembers5.boardhost.com/Nihon-To/&gt;\n  - /for the discussion and sharing of all=\r\n things Nihont=F4/\n\n\n\n\n\n  Jim Gilbert wrote:\n\n  &gt; Rich,\n  &gt; Pieces like tha=\r\nt seem to have been used to change the shape of the \n  &gt; seppa dai to accom=\r\nmodate a certain shape and/or size of saya and \n  &gt; tsuka.  There are tsuba=\r\n where the seppa dai has been enlarged by \n  &gt; fitting pieces all of the wa=\r\ny around.  Sometimes various pieces \n  &gt; (including the more common hitsuan=\r\na plugs) are inserted by a later \n  &gt; collector to restore the look of the =\r\nguard to something like what he \n  &gt; believes to be its original state.\n  &gt;=\r\n\n  &gt; I could imagine a piece like being inserted to repair damage if it \n  =\r\n&gt; were somewhere else on the guard.  It&#39;s hard to imagine how that \n  &gt; par=\r\nticular spot would be damaged. \n  &gt;\n  &gt; I have seen a fair number of tsuba =\r\nthat have a pronounced asymmetry to \n  &gt; the shape of the seppa dai in that=\r\n location.  There is metal &quot;missing&quot; \n  &gt; from the same position at the upp=\r\ner right.  My guess is that at some \n  &gt; time and/or place a slightly asymm=\r\netrical tsuka or saya shape was in \n  &gt; style and that tsuba were either ma=\r\nde or modified to accommodate that \n  &gt; shape.  I haven&#39;t come across such =\r\na koshirae and not being a sword \n  &gt; user I can&#39;t guess as to why such a s=\r\nhape might be desirable. \n  &gt;\n  &gt; The insert on your guard might be an atte=\r\nmpt to change one of these \n  &gt; tsuba to the more common symmetrical oval s=\r\nhape.\n  &gt;\n  &gt; Any other ideas?\n  &gt;\n  &gt; Jim\n  &gt;\n  &gt;\n  &gt;\n\n\n  [Non-text portio=\r\nns of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n----------------------------------=\r\n--------------------------------------------\n  Yahoo!
