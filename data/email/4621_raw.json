I bought it from Skip Holbrook, and that&#39;s where the attribution cam=\r\ne\nfrom, I think because of the sahari inlay work reminding one of similar w=\r\nork\nby the Kunitomo gunsmiths. No one who saw this tsuba, Jim Gilbert, Bob\n=\r\nHaynes, etc. could think of anything better to call it. I&#39;m pretty sure tha=\r\nt\nBob said he did not recognize the kao.\n\nNo papers, unless Elliot has take=\r\nn that step ... it would be interesting to\nsee what &#39;box&#39; the experts would=\r\n put it in.\n\nCraig\n\nOn 11/11/06, Richard Turner &lt;ikkanshi@...&gt; wro=\r\nte:\n&gt;\n&gt;   Hi Elliot, For the Myochin I will definitely go with Haru. Myochi=\r\nn Ki\n&gt; Muneharu. Pete&#39;s already had a good go at describing this smith I th=\r\nink.\n&gt; In regards to the Kunitomo, I have 5 listed, and I am not sure of th=\r\nis\n&gt; one myself. I see no signature so I am assuming it was sold to you wit=\r\nh\n&gt; an attribution, or is papered ?\n&gt;\n&gt; Cheers\n&gt;\n&gt; Richard\n&gt;\n&gt; Elliott wrot=\r\ne:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hi all,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; This is a continuance of my &#39;questions&#39; and some=\r\n new ones....\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; In my photo album, I have added new pictures (#1 and =\r\n#2) of a\n&gt; &gt; Kunitomo piece. I am confused as to which path to follow. I am=\r\n open\n&gt; &gt; to direction.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Photo&#39;s #5 and #6 are the best close-up&#39;s o=\r\nf the Myochin mei I can\n&gt; &gt; get with my lack of good photo equipment. Hopef=\r\nully these will help\n&gt; &gt; in deciding which one (Muneharu or Muneyoshi). And=\r\n maybe Santa Claus\n&gt; &gt; will be good to me and bring me a new camera with Ma=\r\ncro lens.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Last, I have a mei that I can&#39;t seem to find in any volum=\r\ne I have.\n&gt; &gt; The mei is &#39;Nagoya Tsunenari&#39;. He also signed &#39;Bishu Mihara J=\r\nu\n&gt; &gt; Nagoya Tsunenari&#39;. I can&#39;t find him anywhere.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; As always, than=\r\nk you all for your help.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Elliott\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ----------------------=\r\n------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; No virus found in this incomin=\r\ng message.\n&gt; &gt; Checked by AVG Free Edition.\n&gt; &gt; Version: 7.5.430 / Virus Da=\r\ntabase: 268.14.2/528 - Release Date:\n&gt; 11/10/2006 2:31 PM\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; [Non-text=\r\n portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\n\n\n-- \nCraig Harris\nBo=\r\noks from and about Asia\nwww.bridgeofdreams.com\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this=\r\n message have been removed]\n\n\n"
