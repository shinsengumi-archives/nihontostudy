Lovely little piece but I was particularly struck by the koshirae. I am guessing Goto,  I was discussing this with Barry Thomas and his guess was Mino Goto. Maybe Jim G could shed some light on it.\n\n  I was also curious about the papers, would they be Seikeido&#39;s own kantei papers ?.\n\n  http://www.seikeido.com/seikeido/1kanezumi.htm\n\n  The have some excellent tsuba and some wonderful swords. Bob R, have you been here ?, I would guess so.\n\n  Rich T\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
