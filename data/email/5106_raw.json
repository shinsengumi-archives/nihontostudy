I am running on gray matter here.\n\nThis is I believe Echizen Akao.\nhttp://www.nihontokanjipages.com/personal/collection/akao.htm\n\nRich\n\nRon Hartmann wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi Elliott -\n&gt;\n&gt; I can see why you though Akasaka-something but if not that, look at \n&gt; Akao group perhaps. I&#39;m not coming up with any positive thoughts here, \n&gt; just throwing out some idea. Doesn&#39;t look Kyo-sukashi to me. As for \n&gt; Echizen...Echizen what? Echizen makes me think Kinai and that&#39;s not \n&gt; Kinai work from what I can tell. Nice tsuba. The fukurin could be \n&gt; added later so I guess one should think of it &quot;without&quot; that addition.\n&gt;\n&gt; Ron\n&gt; STL\n&gt;\n&gt; ----- Original Message -----\n&gt; From: Elliott\n&gt; To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com &lt;mailto:nihontostudy%40yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Monday, July 16, 2007 6:28 PM\n&gt; Subject: [nihontostudy] Re: It is very quiet here\n&gt;\n&gt; I am still here!\n&gt;\n&gt; After thumbing thru many books and web sites, I have decided to name\n&gt; my mysterious Tsuba (the one mounted on my Hiramasa) Echizen Sukashi.\n&gt; If you go to my album (Elliott&#39;s Album) and look at photo&#39;s 1 thru 7,\n&gt; tell me if you agree or what you think.\n&gt;\n&gt; I first thought Kyo-sukashi but Gordon said &quot;I don&#39;t think so.&quot; Then\n&gt; I was leaning towards Akasaka but the Fukurin was telling me &quot;no&quot;. So\n&gt; I threw my hands up and pondered other stuff.\n&gt;\n&gt; It wasn&#39;t until I was &#39;talking&#39; to Andy Quirt when I ask him and he\n&gt; suggested Echizen. I hadn&#39;t thought of that but I went to searching\n&gt; and maybe............it is!\n&gt;\n&gt; What do you think?\n&gt;\n&gt; Elliott\n&gt; --- In nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n&gt; &lt;mailto:nihontostudy%40yahoogroups.com&gt;, &quot;Richard Turner&quot; &lt;ikkanshi@...&gt;\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Is anyone around ?.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; RichardTurner\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; No virus found in this incoming message.\n&gt; Checked by AVG Free Edition. \n&gt; Version: 7.5.476 / Virus Database: 269.10.6/902 - Release Date: 7/15/2007 2:21 PM\n&gt;   \n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
