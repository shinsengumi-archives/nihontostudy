The few times I&#39;ve looked at \n&gt; these stamps they really didn&#39;t lo=\r\nok like they were &quot;cold stamped.&quot; \n&gt; They don&#39;t appear &quot;sharply&quot; cut nor do=\r\n they appear &quot;pushed out&quot; around \n&gt; their edges (so to speak). But I can&#39;t =\r\nunderstand how you could &quot;hot \n&gt; stamp&quot; a nakago. It would seem the nakago =\r\nwould have to be at a &quot;red&quot; \n&gt; temperature for hot stamping, and that would=\r\n seem to need to be done \n&gt; before the hamon treatment is done. These stamp=\r\ns seem to be nicely \n&gt; done and in keeping with the rest of a &quot;finished&quot; na=\r\nkago, not done way \n&gt; ahead of finishing the nakago. Honestly, I have no kn=\r\nowledge of how \n&gt; this is done, other than what has been passed on over the=\r\n decades. It \n&gt; would be interesting to hear from somebody (swordsmith?) wh=\r\no has \n&gt; first-hand experience on this.

I&#39;ve alwa=\r\nys\n&gt;   refered to these as &quot;hot stamped&quot; but really, I wonder how the smith=\r\n \n&gt; applied\n&gt;   these stamps. The nakago being soft (not hardened), were th=\r\ney punched in\n&gt;   after the sword was finished? It would seem illogical to =\r\nthink the smith\n&gt;   &quot;heated the nakago&quot; enough to &quot;hot stamp&quot; their seal. C=\r\nan anyone \n&gt; explain how\n&gt;   this was done?\n&gt;   &gt;\n&gt;   &gt; A related question =\r\nis about Masahide who did apply a &quot;kokuin&quot; to his\n&gt;   nakago. Does anyone k=\r\nnow if Masahide ever signed his nakago with his\n&gt;   &quot;kokuin&quot; only? (Not sig=\r\nning his full mei with it.)\n&gt;   &gt;\n&gt;   &gt; Ron\n&gt;   &gt; STL\n&gt;   &gt;\n&gt;   &gt;\n&gt;   &gt;\n&gt;  =\r\n &gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;   &gt;\n&gt;   &gt;\n&gt;   &gt;\n=\r\n&gt;   &gt;\n&gt;   &gt;\n&gt;   &gt; Yahoo!
