Because the originality of the tsuba is compromised, there will usually be a significant point reduction for later inlay to a good, older iron plate.  If the inlay is extensive it will probably fail.   If it is an attempt to &quot;convert&quot; the tsuba to a different type (even if mumei), or is very crude or done after the Edo period, it will fail.\n\nA hypothetical good Muromachi period Tosho guard with a subtle mon inlaid during the Edo period would probably pass, but with a much lower point level that the unaltered plate would have been awarded.  Also, if there is significant alteration to the piece, the date given will be that of the latest work.\n\nMost of the late gomoku zogan, mukade, etc., will fail for poor quality.  Maybe an exceptional example could pass, but I can&#39;t think of any examples.  Does anyone have one of these guards with an origami? \n\nMy observations only, not endorsed by anyone.\nJim\n\n  &gt; Jim,\n  &gt;  While making copies for the Chicago shinsa,I notice an iron tsuba \n  &gt; got the pinkie ........reason given was the inlays were added later.\n  &gt; Why is that ?  I mean if the soft metal inlays were added in the Edo \n  &gt; days, it was &quot; fashionable &quot; then and not meant to deceive .\n  &gt; I recall that tsuba was a mumei.\n  &gt; \n\n  Very interested in the reply here. Seems to me a lot of\n  very good tsuba had inlay which were later applications.\n  Ko-Nara, Heianjo, etc commonly used Saotome tsuba as\n  starting points. Also most of the gomoku zogan and mukade\n  styles, the inlay or wire is a later addition. I&#39;m sure\n  many other examples could be cited. Does that\n  mean none of those are eligible for papers?\n\n  Rich S\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
