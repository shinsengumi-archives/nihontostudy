I will research your\nsugge=\r\nstions.  There does seem to be a spot or two of ayasugi.

None the less, still a\ngood research pro=\r\nject.\n\nThanks Again,\n\nDave\n--- In nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Ricky&quot; &lt;fa=\r\nirgreen00@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Lots of possibilites based on your description.

It has a Shin gunto tsuka and a\n&gt; older\n&gt; &gt; appearing Kyo-sukashi ts=\r\nuba. The blade is a bit &quot;rough&quot; but still\n&gt; has\n&gt; &gt; very visible hada. The =\r\nhamon appears to be Suguha for the most\n&gt; part.\n&gt; &gt; The hada is very promin=\r\nant, it seems to be a Itame/Mokume mix with\n&gt; &gt; Masame near the ha. The Mas=\r\name hada also can be clearly seen\n&gt; through\n&gt; &gt; the kissaki. The sword is u=\r\nnsigned with a osujikai yasurime. The\n&gt; &gt; nakago condition appears ( a gues=\r\ns ) approx. 1800-1860. I&#39;m\n&gt; thinking\n&gt; &gt; a late Edo copy of an Koto Yamato=\r\n. Nagasa 65cm, machi width 3.1\n&gt; cm,\n&gt; &gt; yokote 2.1 cm, sori 1.5 cm. Do the=\r\nse characteristics suggest to\n&gt; &gt; anyone a particular Shinshinto School, Sm=\r\nith or Province. I know\n&gt; it\n&gt; &gt; would be difficult with or without blade i=\r\nn hand, but any advice\n&gt; or\n&gt; &gt; information would be appreciated. Thanks...=\r\n..\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n"
