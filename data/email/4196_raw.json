It rather resembles =\r\n\nUmetada (later) Tadatsugu group.  The flash is way too hot to say \nmuch ab=\r\nout the patina.  It&#39;s probably reddish brown under a \nreasonable exposure.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Jim\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;   Here is something that may interest some. Rec=\r\nently I had an \nonline \n&gt; &gt;   discussion about Mito Tsuba. This tsuba&#39;s ima=\r\nge was sent to me \nas an \n&gt; &gt;   example of Mito. Apparently there is some d=\r\niscussion going on \nabout \n&gt; &gt;   it&#39;s age. Mr Robert Haynes has put back th=\r\ne date by 100 years. \nThat \n&gt; &gt;   isn&#39;t what I wonder about. It is the pati=\r\nna and colour. Has \nanyone \n&gt; &gt;   seen this type of patina before?
