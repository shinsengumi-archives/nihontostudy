The shape and the suspension ring remind me of toppei koshirae from Bakumatsu.  The catalog entry claims that the fittings are decorated in uttori, which if correct would suggest a much earlier date.  I can&#39;t tell from the photo whether the ring might be a later modification.  Without having seen it in person all I can do is speculate.  It&#39;s unusual enough that even after seeing it I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if I was still stuck.  \n\nAlan (or anyone else who might have seen it (or now owns it)), any ideas?  This is the lot illustrated as 253, but described under 251.\n\nJim\n\n\n\n  Hi Jim, thanks for the background. If not Ainu, I am very curious \n  what the origin of a koshirae like this would be. Perhaps someone \n  simply cobbled this together from the fragments of other koshirae? \n  Or, maybe this piece originated outside of Japan. I am sure it would \n  be instructive to see the blade...\n\n  - Ray\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
