If the wrap is coming\n&gt; off, it is coming off. They may add something to secure menuki and such to\n&gt; keep them in place - typically thread. The same goes with lacquer, it is\nnot\n&gt; touched. Thus, the standards for shinsa are the same. I am pretty sure\nthis\n&gt; is the case with the NBTHK as well. So, what to do to repair something? If\n&gt; you want to keep the piece original and unaltered, you must have all new\n&gt; mounts made and you set aside the original pieces. I know this may seem to\n&gt; be unreasonable, but those are the very high standards that have been\n&gt; maintained at shinsa and in museums. I think the same holds true for\nantique\n&gt; firearms. Re-blued barrels, re-done stocks and what not seriously harm the\n&gt; value of the piece. Thus, such alterations should not be done lightly.\n\nSo if I were to take the case of my damaged saya... I don&#39;t think that\nthis is particularly important as these things go, but since I have it\non hand it is a useful example.\n\nIf I wanted to submit it to shinsa, does the damage mean it won&#39;t get a\npaper? Or do you accept damaged pieces? \n\nIt was altered, but reversibly so as the pieces screwed off and slipped\noff with a bit of effort... so it is just original and beaten up, but\nthe full set seems to have gone together forever. \n\nIt is probably middle, to slightly more than middle quality, but is\nunusual in that the saya is red. \n\nI understand that red saya were banned on low ranking samurai, along\nwith other red articles of clothing, so it is unusual for that.\n\nI am pondering this now and since the damage is only to the saya, it\nmight be that a correct route would be to send in the set of koshirae\ntogether to see if it would paper and so authenticate it as an original\nset... quality might get marked down considerably then because of the\ndamage. But then I could have a replacement made for the damaged\nsaya. The tsuka looks to have survived pretty intact. \n\nI have no experience in this stuff, I&#39;m asking for my own education, and\nmaybe as a possible something-to-do with this set of koshirae.\n\n- darcy\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYahoo!
