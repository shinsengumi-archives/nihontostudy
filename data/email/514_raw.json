The term does appear in his auction catalogs, although that \n&gt; is not sufficient grounds for proving the existence of the group.  \n&gt; Calling something &quot;nameless shiiremono&quot; would of course not advance a sale.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Tetsu no Isho - Mito-To to Tosogu no Meihin&quot; is indeed the book I was \n&gt; thinking of.  Of course we wouldn&#39;t expect to see the low quality \n&gt; examples from any group or region illustrated or referenced.  So the \n&gt; absence of mention is not necessarily proof of non-existence.\n&gt; \nI agree that the very title which includes the word\nMeihin (distinguished works) would exempt the inclusion\nof lower class items (shiiremono).\nHowever, since the book is quite a comprehensive study,\nI am assuming that if there were Shoami works produced there\n(i.e.. signed Suifu ju Shoami xxxx) they would have included\nthe best examples known.\n\n&gt; I don&#39;t believe that I have ever seen a kanteisho to Mito Shoami.  \n&gt; However, when I assisted Hagihara-sensei at last year&#39;s shinsa in Jersey \n&gt; City, the so-called &quot;Mito Shoami&quot; type examples submitted were all \n&gt; rejected as &quot;poor quality work,&quot; so there was no opportunity for such an \n&gt; attribution to be made on an NTHK kanteisho.  If that is the standard \n&gt; judgment of the NBTHK, we would not expect to see any Mito Shoami \n&gt; kanteisho at all, even if the group existed.\n\n&gt; I do not recall seeing any examples signed Mito Shoami.  I have seen \n&gt; examples signed Aizu ju Shoami and I have seen many mumei pieces, \n&gt; although of better quality than the &quot;Mito Shoami&quot; examples, attributed \n&gt; to Aizu Shoami. \n\n\nI&#39;m relieved in a way that your empirical\nobservations coincide with mine.\nI was wondering if indeed Hagihara sensei\nhad in fact papered some tsuba to &quot;Mito Shoami&quot;.\nI would have very much liked to see an example of\nwhat he considered worthy of papering as such.\nAs you know, I have great respect for his opinions.\n\n\n&gt; I assume you can picture the type of tsuba that we have been calling \n&gt; Mito Shoami.  There are many of them in the US and the type is quite \n&gt; uniform.  Who do you think made all of those tsuba?  Serious question.\n&gt; \nIndeed I do.\nSerious answer - Anonymous (no shame in that).\nMuseums often use that term in other fields in cases in which\na work is simply non-attributable to a specific artist or school.\n\n\n&gt; The merit of the usage of the term Mito Shoami deserves follow up.  I \n&gt; think that we&#39;ll find that these guards are indeed ignored as shiiremono \n&gt; and are not likely to be documented or recognized by Japanese sources.  \n&gt; Again, interesting observation.\n&gt; \n&gt; Jim\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   Jim, Alan, Rich et al.\n&gt; \n&gt;   My remarks may be radical and heretical considering\n&gt;   how casually the term &quot;Mito Shoami&quot; is bandied about\n&gt;   on this list and others.\n&gt; \n&gt;   I have never seen a tsuba or other kodogu attributed\n&gt;   to Mito Shoami. I am of the opinion that Shoami\n&gt;   artisans were not productive there.\n&gt; \n&gt;   There are certainly pieces that have papered to just Mito.\n&gt;   But none that I know of to Mito Shoami,\n&gt;   in which case the basic premise is incorrect.\n&gt; \n&gt;   Jim,\n&gt;   The book you are referring to I presume is titled:\n&gt;   Tetsu no Isho - Mito-To to Tosogu no Meihin (1996).\n&gt;   Ibaraki Prefectural Historical Museum.\n&gt; \n&gt;   In section II - Mito Kinko no Tosogu,\n&gt;   The introductory text records prominent individuals\n&gt;   and groups that were active in Mito (Hitachi province).\n&gt;   Among them:\n&gt;   Gunji Yogoro\n&gt;   Yatabe Tsuji\n&gt;   Seiryuken Ha\n&gt;   Ichiryu (Hitotsuyanagi) Ha\n&gt;   Tamagawa Ha\n&gt;   Uchikoshi Ha\n&gt;   Yasuchika Ha (from the 4th gen. Yasuchika)\n&gt;   Saotome and Myochin.\n&gt;   And of course, Hagiya Shohei (Katsuhira) and Unno Shomin.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   NO mention of Shoami in Mito.\n&gt; \n&gt;   Checking Haynes- Tsuba, An Aesthetic Study.\n&gt;   Under the section dealing with SHOAMI he mentions:\n&gt;   Kyo Shoami, Awa Shoami, Bizen Shoami, Iyo Shoami,\n&gt;   Aizu Shoami, Shonai Shoami, Akita Shoami,\n&gt;   Bushu (Edo) Shoami & Sakushu (Mimasaka) Shoami.\n&gt;   In addition he adds individuals who signed:\n&gt;   Oshu Shoami, Soshu (Odawara) Shoami, Seishu (Ise) Shoami,\n&gt;   Osaka (Settsu) Shoami, Banshu (Harima) Shoami,\n&gt;   Inshu (Inaba) Shoami & Kurume (Chikugo) Shoami.\n&gt; \n&gt;   Again NO mention of Mito Shoami.\n&gt; \n&gt;   I have never liked the term Mito Shoami\n&gt;   and have never used it. This thread presented\n&gt;   an opportunity to research the issue\n&gt;   to see if my opinion had any basis.\n&gt; \n&gt;   Can anyone document a piece that has been\n&gt;   authoritatively classified as Mito Shoami\n&gt;   or have we been perpetuating a fallacy?\n&gt; \n&gt;   Cary Condell\n&gt; \n&gt;   Condell & Co., Ltd.\n&gt;   P.O. Box 590115\n&gt;   San Francisco, CA 94159\n&gt; \n&gt;   Tel. 415-751-3784\n&gt; \n&gt;   condell@...\n&gt;   http://www.ikkyudo.com\n&gt; \n&gt;   Jim Gilbert wrote:\n&gt;   &gt; Rich & all,\n&gt;   &gt; Alan is definitely correct.  While not always to my personal taste,\n&gt;   &gt; there were a number of Mito lines producing very high quality \n&gt; fittings. \n&gt;   &gt; Several of these Mito lineage founders were students of leading kinko\n&gt;   &gt; artists.  No doubt the Mito Tokugawa branch family (with 350,000 koku\n&gt;   &gt; revenue) and their retainers were responsible for supporting these many\n&gt;   &gt; skilled workers.\n&gt;   &gt;\n&gt;   &gt; The standardized plates, designs taken from copy books, large scale\n&gt;   &gt; production and relatively poor quality are characteristics of the Mito\n&gt;   &gt; Shoami.  Aizu Shoami workers did a lot of the same.\n&gt;   &gt;\n&gt;   &gt; There are some rather poor quality, unsigned Mito tsuba as well.  It&#39;s\n&gt;   &gt; probably possible to find a group of better than average Mito Shoami\n&gt;   &gt; work that exceeds the quality of the bottom of Mito production.  These\n&gt;   &gt; lesser pieces are probably the source of the confusion between Mito and\n&gt;   &gt; Mito Shoami.  I have seen some fairly insipid mumei tsuba with \n&gt; kanteisho\n&gt;   &gt; to Mito.\n&gt;   &gt;\n&gt;   &gt; It&#39;s true that better Mito workers did copy Nara, Hamano and others, \n&gt; but\n&gt;   &gt; their copy work is nothing like the Mito Shoami stuff after the Nara\n&gt;   &gt; style.  If anything the workmanship of the Mito copies is a bit over \n&gt; the\n&gt;   &gt; top compared with the originals.  It&#39;s also usually signed by the maker.\n&gt;   &gt;\n&gt;   &gt; There was a book on published 5-10 years ago on Mito swords and \n&gt; tosogu. \n&gt;   &gt; Mine is out on loan and I don&#39;t remember the title or author&#39;s name. \n&gt;   &gt; Does anyone have one handy?  In any event, that&#39;s a good book to look\n&gt;   &gt; through to get a feel for the better Mito work.\n&gt;   &gt;\n&gt;   &gt; Jim\n&gt;   &gt;\n&gt;   &gt;\n&gt;   &gt;\n&gt;   &gt;   Rich,\n&gt;   &gt;   I think you are mistaken in your appraisal of Mito work, the Mito \n&gt; Shoami\n&gt;   &gt;   never achieved much prominence but the Mito Kinko are among the best\n&gt;   &gt; artists\n&gt;   &gt;   who ever made fittings, particularly in the late Edo/Meiji periods \n&gt; with\n&gt;   &gt;   artists like Hagiya Katsuhei and Unno Shomin. They were also very able\n&gt;   &gt;   copyists, I remember Mr Ono some years ago showed me a well known \n&gt; Somin\n&gt;   &gt;   kozuka of a horse (seen from the rear) in takazogan, I asked him how\n&gt;   &gt; to tell\n&gt;   &gt;   the real thing from a Mito copy, he said the only difference was that\n&gt;   &gt; in the\n&gt;   &gt;   copy the horse stood more proud, or was it the other way around?\n&gt;   &gt;   Alan\n&gt;   &gt;\n&gt;   &gt;\n&gt;   &gt;&gt;\n&gt;   &gt;\n&gt;   &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;         Yahoo!
