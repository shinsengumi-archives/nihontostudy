I have a lot of books on\n&gt; Japanese Swords, but none of them have much on Tsubas.  I have a whole list\n&gt; of Books that Jim had up on his website, which I&#39;m trying to find out how to\n&gt; get some of them.  What books are really good and where can I get them?\n&gt; \n&gt; Also, I purchased a set of Tsuba&#39;s from a Local Auction House in Portland,\n&gt; Oregon and need to find info on them.  Can we send the photos on this list,\n&gt; or do I need to put them up on my website and put a hyperlink to them?\n&gt; \n&gt; Thank you,\n&gt; Kim\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \t\t\n&gt; _______________________________\n&gt; Do you Yahoo!?\n&gt; Express yourself with Y!
