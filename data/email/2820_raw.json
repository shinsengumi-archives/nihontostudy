I went right through \nthe Akasaka books and cannot find a single tsuba with the kakushi-tagane \nthough straight lines were used form time to time by the second \nTadamasa. Akasaka and Tosa Myochin can at times be very hard to separate \nI find but it is these little tips that help separate them that make the \njob just a tad easier.\n\nI guess one thing is, when in hand, it&#39;s look of age might help. Sasano \nreports that the Tosa Myochin group started in the mid 1800&#39;s or there \nabouts. I have a signed Tosa Myochin tsuba signed Toshu ju Kuniyoshi \nSaku ( shoshin according to Hagihara sensei ) that would date to about \n1780 - 1800. I know Cary has a Tosa Myochin piece about the same age. I \nhave not heard of them earlier than that, has anyone else ?. I kind of \nthink from the images, this tsuba of mine looks older than the 1800&#39;s, \nbut then again, as I a said, when I have it in hand, it may be easier to \ntell.\n\nAnyway, food for thought, I like Tosa Myochin also as a school and would \nnot be upset if it turned out that way.\n\nbest wishes\n\nRich\n\n\nRon Hartmann wrote:\n\n&gt; Hi Rich, all -\n&gt;\n&gt; Not to be a wet blanket here but--referring to the first tsuba with \n&gt; chidori--I suspect this would be designated Tosa Myochin made in \n&gt; Akasaka style. I say this because of the distinctive tagane \n&gt; (kakushi-tagane) around the nakago-ana, a Tosa Myochin trait according \n&gt; the Sasano and others. (Sasano points this out in his original English \n&gt; sukashi tsuba book, pages 218-220.)\n&gt;\n&gt; Not to muddy up the waters, but an odd experience with a like-tsuba \n&gt; was experienced by me back in the early 1980s. In 1979 during a \n&gt; Chicago NTHK shinsa, Sasano papered a friend&#39;s mumei tsuba as (I \n&gt; believe) 2nd master Akasaka work. Later, the tsuba went to a Haynes \n&gt; auction where I purchased it. Bob Haynes was adamant about the tsuba \n&gt; &quot;looking like&quot; Akasaka, but that in reality it was Tosa Myochi. His \n&gt; argument was based largely on these &quot;wisker-like&quot; kakushi-tagane that \n&gt; were place around the tsuba&#39;s nakago-ana. I sold that tsuba a year or \n&gt; two ago and passed on this story along with the original NTHK paper \n&gt; declaring it Akasaka. Either way, it remains a fine tsuba!\n&gt;\n&gt; Ron\n&gt; STL\n\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
