Having read the Koza entry, Haynes\n&gt; Index,\n&gt;   Torigoye, and a few other references- there seems\n&gt; to\n&gt;   be a lot of confusion.\n&gt; \n&gt;   Haynes Index indicates the relationship between\n&gt; the\n&gt;   Kunitomo tsuba vs those signed Hazama is unclear.\n&gt; The\n&gt;   Koza has the founder being Kunitomo Mura &lt;?&gt; (no\n&gt;   clarification or mention of whether he ever\n&gt; signed)\n&gt;   and then Kunitomo Teihei (aka Sadashige) moving to\n&gt;   Kameyama and working.\n&gt; \n&gt;   Some texts state the Hazama came first, then the\n&gt;   Kunitomo. Other seem to have it the other way\n&gt; around.\n&gt;   Anyone able to share the current thought on these\n&gt;   groups. Are they one and the same, or two doing\n&gt;   similar work?\n&gt;   What is the standing and relation of Teiei\n&gt;   (Sadashige) to those signed Hazama? Should he be\n&gt;   considered the founder of a Kameyama subgroup of\n&gt; the\n&gt;   Kunitomo? His work seems the most primitive of the\n&gt; 4\n&gt;   tsuba, but then he and the other Kunitomo tsuba\n&gt; are\n&gt;   working in iron while the Hazama are in much\n&gt; softer\n&gt;   copper. \n&gt; \n&gt;   Any help much appreciated!\n&gt; \n&gt;   Curran\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt;\n__________________________________________________________\n&gt;   It&#39;s here!
