I am trying\nto id them.  the 1st (labeled mantis20) has basket\nweave design.  I have looked through every reference i\nhave and am thinking bushu or shoami- of course.  Can\nanyone give me any thoughts?  Any other schools to\nconsider?  I also have another similiar one coming\nsoon that was papered to the sanagawa (sp?) school, an\noffshoot of ito (bushu) I believe.\n\nThe 2nd tsuba (labeled mantis21)has this subtle\nsunburst on both sides of the plate under the designs.\n I was trying to determine if the lines are raised or\nnot.  They may be a little, I can&#39;t really tell. \nEverytime I run my fingertips over them I go back &\nforth between smooth or ridges.  You can make out some\nof the starburst on the right hand side of the\npictured back side to get an idea (didn&#39;t come out in\nthe photo much).  I also can&#39;t tell if the mimi is\nadded seperate or not.  It has been worked regardless\nto give a texture.  Any help on id&#39;ing this one also\nwould be great, along with a guess as to age.  I of\ncourse assume they are both edo.\n\nThe photos are stored in the nihontostudy photo folder\nunder &quot;mantis dude&quot;. Here is the link\n\nhttp://tinyurl.com/9zvf5  or long link is\nhttp://photos.groups.yahoo.com/group/nihontostudy/lst?.dir=/Mantis+dude&.src=gr&.order=&.view=t&.done=http%3a//briefcase.yahoo.com/\n\nThanks.\nKen\n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________ \nYahoo!
