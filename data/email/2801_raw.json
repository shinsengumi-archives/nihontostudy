The blade was basically a one-piece machine-made pattern into which a hard steel cutting edge (steel) is welded in. These had a yakiba produced by oil tempering, but show no nie or nioi along it. Harry  referred to Murata-to being &quot;superior hand-finished machine-made&quot; swords. \n\nI&#39;ve had swords which had come through my hands over the years that to my way of thinking, were Murata-to. In the &quot;early days&quot; these would fool me into thinking they were really good swords because of the nice shape to them and (usually) bo hi, but the lack of any grain or nioi/nie would convince me otherwise. I still have a nice &quot;naval dress sword&quot; that I keep because of it being &quot;an example&quot; and that has one of these kind of blades in it. \n\nIf you would like a copy of these two articles, email me at: swords@... and I will scan them for you. Both are brief articles.\n\nRon\nSTL\n\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: emucrawler \n  To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Thursday, April 14, 2005 11:19 AM\n  Subject: [nihontostudy] MURATATO\n\n\n\n  Hi,\n\n  I am from Brasil.\n  Can any one describe to me whats is &quot;Muratato&quot; ?\n  Is that some kind of process to produce swords in WWII ?
