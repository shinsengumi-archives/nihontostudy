Look at my tsuba. Could this be\nthe \n&gt; same artist or school?\n&gt; http://hem.bredband.net/odrike/Tsuba2.htm\n&gt; \n&gt; Also look at Richard Stein&#39;s page he&#39;s got a par of daisho tsuba\nmade by \n&gt; Shoami Shigenobu\n&gt; http://www.geocities.com/alchemyst/tsuba/tsubadai.htm\n&gt; \n&gt; But its only the clouds that are simular dont know if Shigenobu worked \n&gt; with Shukado.\n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; Fredrik\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; gargy980 wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;I just bought these tsuba at a flea market. They were Elmer&#39;s glued to\n&gt; &gt;a pine board with a frame around it.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Pictures are posted in folder &quot;Flea Market Tsuba&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;I&#39;d like to get some info on them. I haven&#39;t had much luck searching\n&gt; &gt;on the internet. Any suggestions or info?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Thanks in advance.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;Yahoo!
