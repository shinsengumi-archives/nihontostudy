Just back from holidays and arrived home to a new \npiece for the collection. I purchased this guard as Ko Akasaka from a \ntrusted seller in Japan. I believe though that it is Owari. It has \noutstanding colour and iron I think and is in wonderful condition. I \nwould put this as early Edo but happy to be corrected. There is a \nsimilar tsuba listed in the Tsuba Taikan dated to the mid 1400&#39;s. It has \na great masashino theme but I am unsure of the relationship of the \nginger leaves and mon or pine tree as the hitsu ana. I have started to \nwonder, as they have straight bars coming from both, if they are both \nmon and in fact, war fans meeting on the grassy battle field. Anyway, \nthat&#39;s just some fanciful thought. Here are some images.\n\nhttp://www.nihontomessageboard.com/tsuba_collection/owari-masashino.jpg\n\nhttp://www.nihontomessageboard.com/tsuba_collection/owari-masashino-1.jpg\n\nhttp://www.nihontomessageboard.com/tsuba_collection/owari-masashino-2.jpg\n\nIt also has very fine running tekkotsu in the mimi, a lot like another \nEdo Owari guard I have, just not as pronounced. This is the other mimi.\n\nhttp://www.nihontomessageboard.com/tsuba_collection/owari-mimi.jpg\n\nAny thoughts or comments would be appreciated.\n\nNote: the scan of the new tsuba makes the patina look a little odd, I am \nunsure why this is, but it is in tact and very nice.\n\nKind regards\n\nRich Turner\n\n"
