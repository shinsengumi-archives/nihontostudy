Mito is\n: not the same as Mito Shoami although they\n: both worked in the same area and undoubtedly\n: there is some contact. Styles are somewhat similar,\n: but IMHO, Mito Shoami does the better work.\n: There is some fine Mito work also. Mito tends\n: to be more copying of Nara school, using a lot\n: of shiriimono plates and styles. I hope Jim\n: will fill in the gaps and correct any errors\n: in the above.\n:\n: Rich\n: ------------------------------------------------------------\n:  Richard Stein, PhD          alchemyst@...\n:\n:              The Japanese Sword Index\n:   http://www.geocities.com/alchemyst/nihonto.htm\n:\n:\n:   No trees were killed in the sending of this message.\n: However, a large number of electrons were inconvenienced.\n: ------------------------------------------------------------\n:\n:\n:\n: To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n: nihontostudy-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n:\n:\n:\n: Your use of Yahoo!
