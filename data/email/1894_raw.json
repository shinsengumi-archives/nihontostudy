They have those deeply hammered plates almost like Tembo work, and the brass inlay motifs vary but don&#39;t seem to directly relate to the forming of the plate.  The shape of the kogai ana is also very consistent within this type.  I&#39;m not aware of any signed examples that would give a clue as to how they might relate to the other types of brass inlay guards lumped together under Heianjo zogan.  They seem to date to Momoyama to early Edo.  Yours is on the later end of the range.\n\nI&#39;ve never seen a wisteria with leaves like that.\n\nJim\n\n\n\n  opinion needed for  the wisteria motif tsuba as to school, period und \n  stuff like that.\n\n  Please klick.............\n\n  http://tinyurl.com/2w3ow\n\n  thank you all in advance.\n\n  Milt\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
