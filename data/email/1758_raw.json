A friend left a &quot;jug of &quot;elixor&quot; with me during a move several months back, but he warned me that it was &quot;toxic.&quot; One of the &quot;old formulas&quot; that can be found, I&#39;ve never had a go at it for fear of poisoning myself or contaminating my house with toxic stuff! Maybe this summer, outdoors...  I&#39;ve always felt that those ancient tsuba makers must had used something pretty simple and from nature. Reminds me years ago when our old mutual friend Clarence, had his cat spray some fittings he had laying around and turned some damaged shakudo a nice black! ;-) \n\nRon\nSTL\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: Peter A Bleed \n  To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Monday, March 22, 2004 11:51 AM\n  Subject: Re: [nihontostudy] The joy of tosho tsuba\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Hi Pete -\n\n  &gt;...it was also entirely bright. In that condition &gt;It wouldn&#39;t look\n  good...so I invited it to have &gt;a bit of color.

You showing me yours and I&#39;ll.. .   .\n  Actually, I was hoping that by being a bit coy on this point, we could get\n  some discussion going. There are purists and experts on this list,\n  afterall. I am sure that somebody will object to almost any treatment, so I\n  hesitate to set them off by describing &quot;my&quot; method.\n  In simple terms, tho, there are two options, right? There is either 1)\n  heat at some level OR 2) some &#39;elixir.&#39;\n  What DOES the world think of those options?\n  Pete\n\n\n        Yahoo!
