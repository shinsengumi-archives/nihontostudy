Unless you can post photos of the tanto and its nakago, I for one would love to see some photos of it. One would think the commander would have owned a quality tanto, be it old or Showa era.

It was found\n  on the body of Commander Goichi Oya (Commander of Japanese forces on Tinian\n  Island during WW II), who committed Seppuku in a cave on the Island during\n  the US invasion. The body and the Tanto were found by a US Marine named\n  Fred Osgood who was awarded the Bronze Star and a Purple Heart. He sent the\n  Tanto home in 1944 after the action on Tinian Island, and it was in his\n  possession since his return from the war until November of 2012 when it\n  came into my possession.\n\n  The Tanto is 13 1/16&quot; long with 3 3/8&quot; being the Nakago (As measured from\n  the Tsuba notch). It is 0.229&quot; thick just in front of the notch. The Nakago\n  tapers to 0.115 at it&#39;s end (See attached file image).\n\n  At this point I am wondering if any one has more information on this\n  particular, or type of, Tanto.\n\n  What I have found so far is that Commander Giochi Oya was A Commander in\n  the Imperial Japanese Navy, and Commander of the IJN 56th guard Unit, with\n  his head Quarters at Mt. Lasso, Tinian Island. He was responsible for the\n  defenses of the four air fields on Tinian Island. There on Tinian Island he\n  committed Seppuku August 2, 1944.\n\n  Thanks in advance for any information available,\n\n  Ed.\n\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n  \n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
