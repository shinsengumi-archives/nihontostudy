However, with all of the repros being \n  produced I want to be as su=\r\nre as I can before any purchase.\n  My concern with this particular sword is=\r\n the excessive amount of text \n  seen on the nakago. I have never seen a pu=\r\nblished example with so much\n  writing. It almost appears overdone on purpo=\r\nse so as to make the \n  piece look authentic.\n  Would appreciate the group&#39;=\r\ns opinion on this and any other aspects of \n  the sword that may look suspi=\r\ncious to you.\n  http://tinyurl.com/yok5wk\n  http://tinyurl.com/22ek8o\n  htt=\r\np://tinyurl.com/29vkog\n  http://tinyurl.com/2bx95b\n  http://tinyurl.com/26q=\r\nmfv\n\n  These should post as clickable links, but if not I&#39;ll be glad to \n  =\r\nupload them to the photo section.\n\n  Thanks,\n\n  Keith Simmons\n\n\n\n   \n\n[Non-=\r\ntext portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
