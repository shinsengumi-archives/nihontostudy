It seems that a lot of the early tachi fittings got reused \nin various ways - could it be that\na lot of these pieces got &quot;recycled&quot; into wakizashi one way or another, \nhence the large number of early tsuba that have\nthe kozuka ana?.\n\ndonning the asbestos underwear...\n\nrkg\n(Richard George)\n\n&gt;Hi,\n&gt;Just time for a partial answer.  From early koshirae I have seen, katana are mounted with kogai only, kozuka and kogai, or neither.  I have not seen a katana mounted with only a kozuka.\n&gt;\n&gt;Wakizashi are very commonly mounted with only a kozuka, but are also seen with kozuka and kogai.\n&gt;\n&gt;The two files in the nihontostudy website File section include columns to indicate the kozuka and kogai configuration for each mounting in the Katana Koshirae catalog.\n&gt;\n&gt;We see a fair number of 8+ cm tsuba around with a kozuka ana cut in them...  were they really big wakizashi tsuba, were katana mounted with kozuka only at some point or was the ana used for a kogai, despite the kozuka shape?  I don&#39;t know.  There is one wakizashi koshirae in the spread sheet with an 8.6 cm tsuba, so that might be the explanation.\n&gt;\n&gt;I&#39;ll come back to this later.\n&gt;\n&gt;Jim\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  Ken -\n&gt;\n&gt;  Presence of kogai and kozuka ana are maybe part of the\n&gt;  story. I asked Jim a similar question and as I understood\n&gt;  his reply (perhaps he will elaborate); katana tsuba\n&gt;  normally have both kozuka and kogai ana or either\n&gt;  while wakizashi tsuba normally only have a kozuka ana.\n&gt;  Although there are numerous exceptions; small sukashi\n&gt;  tsuba which to my eye are obviously for a wakizashi\n&gt;  based on size not uncommonly have both. Also many\n&gt;  of the very early tosho and katchushi tsuba had\n&gt;  only one (many had been added later). I hope I haven&#39;t\n&gt;  done too much damage to what Jim had said. I&#39;m sure\n&gt;  he will fill in the blanks.\n&gt;\n&gt;  Rich\n&gt;\n&gt;[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt;nihontostudy-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;\n&gt;Your use of Yahoo!
