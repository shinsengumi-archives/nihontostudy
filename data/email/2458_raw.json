I would write to the middle of the\npage with my left hand, then change hands and continue to the right.\nIn those days it wasn&#39;t seen as a good thing, so they forced me to\nchoose a hand. So now i am left handed, but do most sports with my\nright hand, and sometimes forget which hands to hold a knife and fork\nwith. I would think that lefties are far more ambidextrous than right\nhanded people.\nNice to shave each side of the face with the appropriate hand :-)\nAs for Muslim customs..I wouldn&#39;t know. I use the umm..appropriate\nmethods. But don&#39;t try and shake hands with your left hand if the\nperson is Muslim...even if you are carrying boxes with your right.\nTrust me...the looks will kill you. Haha.\n\nBrian\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
