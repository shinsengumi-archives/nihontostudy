I have =\r\nrecently be contacted by a gentleman who inherited some 3 dozen Japanese sw=\r\nords from a relative.  These are WW-2 bring backs, and still in the origina=\r\nl shipping crates.  Most of the swords are in gunto or kaigunto mounts, and=\r\n I haven&#39;t had the opportunity to inspect them yet in person.  From the dig=\r\nital images he sent me the swords seem genuine enough.  There are a few par=\r\nade sabers present, and some bukezukuri mounts as well.\n\nI normally have no=\r\nthing to do with gunto and could use some guidelines, please.  What would b=\r\ne a fair purchase value (wholesale) for common gunto and kaigunto?  What ar=\r\ne they selling for (retail?)  I am thinking of trying to get the whole lot,=\r\n and then sell off the ones I don&#39;t need, if that is feasible.  If not, the=\r\nn I will try to just negotitiate for the older swords in the batch.  Then a=\r\ngain, the whole deal may fall through.\n\nIf some of you active traders out t=\r\nhere wouldn&#39;t mind sharing some insight, I would appreciate it.  If you thi=\r\nnk this is something that should be discussed privately, please respond dir=\r\nectly to my personal email address, and not back to the list. (in other wor=\r\nds, just don&#39;t hit the &quot;reply&quot; button.\n\nI thank you for your guidance.\n\nBob=\r\n\n\n\n"
