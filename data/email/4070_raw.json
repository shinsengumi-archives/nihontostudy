No. 8 does make me think Omori work. Other than that, with what looks like heavy gold overlay, I&#39;m not sure where I&#39;d go from there. (I&#39;ve a pair of same motif menuki that I&#39;ve had for decades, and still scratching my head over.)\n\nThis would seem to be Kaga work based on the flat inlay &quot;fret&quot; work but honestly, the tsuba &quot;feels&quot; like something made by Norisuke, particularly the way the flowers are represented. I suspect this is possibly his work and if so, quite a nice example.
