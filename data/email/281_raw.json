It is 3.5  inches in diameter and .25 inches thick.  It is made from two pieces of leather and it appears that there may be a fabric covering under the lacquer..you can see a weave looking design on the edges where the lacquer is cracked away.  This particular tsuba fit on the pole about a foot behind the blade.  There is a four pointed iron guard device that goes in front of it.  I don&#39;t have the whole pole, but I do have all the forward parts.&quot;\n\nJim\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
