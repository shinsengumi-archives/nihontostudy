I think though that if this was \nOwari or Kyo, it would be early Edo as opposed to Muromachi, though as \nPete also notes, with out the guard in hand, it is very hard to say.\n\nCheers\n\nRich\n\n\n\nOn 31/12/2005, at 4:12 AM, klepet33319 wrote:\n\n&gt; I would say it looks to fit into the Kyosukashi school.  I was looking\n&gt; at it yesterday and it seems to be a nice piece.  The small kogaibitsu\n&gt; would point toward an earlier piece. However, I suppose it could be an\n&gt; 1800&#39;s Bakamatsu period piece.   I don&#39;t have it in hand nor the\n&gt; experience with metal types to make a qualified decision.  In any case\n&gt; the price seems reasonable.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; \t\n&gt;&gt; \t\t\n&gt;&gt; __________________________________\n&gt;&gt; Yahoo! for Good - Make a difference this year.\n&gt;&gt; http://brand.yahoo.com/cybergivingweek2005/\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
