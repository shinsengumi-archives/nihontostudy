I have seen many other\n&gt; so-called Japanese swords with serial numbers on the blade, and these\n&gt; were almost all Chinese fakes. For some reason, they think this\n&gt; increases the value or legitimacy.\n&gt; After the war, most of the civilian swords (bar a few identified as\n&gt; art objects) were confiscated, not registered.\n&gt; There is very little chance of tracking down the original owners or\n&gt; history of 99% of these swords.\n&gt;\n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; Brian\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hello David -\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Welcome and Happy 2006 to you too.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; If you have a sword with a serial number stamped on it (on the\n&gt; blade) then you have a mass produced so-called &quot;factory made&quot; sword.\n&gt; Sometimes you will find some numbers stamped on the nakago (tang) of a\n&gt; sword, usually two or three digits, which in that case might relate to\n&gt; &quot;assembly&quot; numbers; these same numbers are often repeated on seppa,\n&gt; tsuba, etc. Swords were &quot;registered&quot; after the war and continue to be\n&gt; so today, but the Japanese government never required anything\n&gt; (registration numbers) to be stamped on swords.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Ron\n&gt; &gt; STL\n&gt; &gt;   ----- Original Message -----\n&gt; &gt;   From: dpoll64\n&gt; &gt;   To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt;   Sent: Wednesday, January 04, 2006 3:12 PM\n&gt; &gt;   Subject: [nihontostudy] SERIAL NUMBERS ON JAPANESE SWORDS\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;   Firstly, happy  new  year and nice  to meeet  you  all.
