We have iron sukashi, iron sukashi with hira zogan and gilded yamagane tsuba from as early as the Kofun period.  We also have many decorated copper alloy tachi tsuba from the Heian through Muromachi periods.  No doubt that the metal tsuba have more &quot;show potential&quot; and certain functional advantages, but hide tsuba appear to have been the guards of choice on fighting tachi from at least the late Heian through Nanbokucho periods.  Metal sukashi and inlay were certainly known at the time but apparently not widely chosen for combat.  Richard M. may have hit on the extreme light weight as being the primary advantage while still providing &quot;good enough&quot; protection for the hand under the prevailing fighting conditions described by Pat, Tom and Gordon.  I&#39;d like to hear more ideas...\n\nJim\n\nWould flash and style have had much to do with the introduction of metal tsuba ?, I am sure that the beauty of a Gold and Silver inlayed piece or a well carved sukashi tsuba would have turned some heads as apposed to a lacquered hide tsuba.\n\nRich T\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
