Perhaps each of those among us who collect and study tsuba might take the time to write a few paragraphs identifying the particular merits of, and reasons for collecting, a particular school.  The really outspoken might go farther and identify a school, or type, of tsuba they do not collect, and explain why.\n\nDZ     \n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: klepet33319 \n  To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Sunday, March 12, 2006 3:42 PM\n  Subject: [nihontostudy] Kantei\n\n\n  I for one have enjoyed Jim&#39;s kantei(s).  I am wondering if the other \n  members concur and if they might like something like a regular kantei, \n  possibly Friday with answer on Sunday?  Or bi-weekly? Perhaps we could \n  generate a list of those interested in submitting their treasures with \n  one member being chosen by Jim each week.  Then that party could post a \n  picture with Jim giving his ideas at the close of the bidding.  That \n  way he&#39;d be on the hot-seat as well (although I think luke warm in his \n  case at best LOL).  Just some thoughts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  YAHOO! GROUPS LINKS \n\n    a..
