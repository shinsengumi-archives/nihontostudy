I see there have been a few \nfollowup&#39;s here on another forum. Going through my copy of  Mito \nKoromono Shu, I feel it is hard to judge a lot of what is and what isn&#39;t \nin Goto or Ko Kinko without the availability of the pieces in hand.  I \nthink a lot of the Ko Mino work are easier to judge though simply \nthrough the depth of carving and the subject matter. The examples in \nKinko Mino Bori show this quite clearly I think. One of the opinions on \nthis question I like the most is on the Choshuya Ginza website.\n\nhttp://world.choshuya.co.jp/kokinkou/index.htm\n\nThis article is one of there better I think in dealing with this \nconfusion, even though it does not actually offer an actual answer.\n\nCheers and thanks for getting me thinking :-)\n\nRichard\n\nRon Hartmann wrote:\n&gt;   Kogai rank right after first ranked menuki when it comes to tosogu \n&gt; but after all these decades of trying to learn, I&#39;ve found it very \n&gt; difficult to gain much understand kogai. Obviously, the best way to \n&gt; learn is by studying examples with peers, but those opportunities \n&gt; seldom present themselves, especially here in the midwest. This \n&gt; dilemma presented itself again since the San Francisco show. \n&gt; Naturally, one thinks &quot;Goto&quot; when it comes to fine kogai, but of \n&gt; course there were many other makers to consider. Mike Yamasaki&#39;s \n&gt; /Machibori/ display touched upon that. Remarking on a particular kogai \n&gt; exhibited by Mike, I commented that if the item had not been \n&gt; identified as one of the artists considered a machibori smith, I would \n&gt; had thought it Goto work! Mike pointed out that no, that this is wrong \n&gt; and that is wrong for Goto. How great it would be to sit down at \n&gt; length with good &quot;examples&quot; and with somebody of knowledge to compare \n&gt; and point out these kantei differences! &quot;Bits and pieces&quot; can be \n&gt; learned at shows, but that&#39;s about it.\n&gt;  \n&gt;   My question to the groups is: what sources of information have you \n&gt; found to be really useful -- teachable material -- that helped you \n&gt; understand kogai and to differenciate between the different schools \n&gt; who made kogai. I have a good library after all these years, but it is \n&gt; surprising what little information is here that helps. Certainly, good \n&gt; photos exist (mostly on Goto works) but there must be some material \n&gt; out there in publication that &quot;compares&quot; the work of different groups, \n&gt; pointing out the differences. How great it must be to be in Japan or \n&gt; California or New York and to have opportunities to do this with real \n&gt; examples!!! Any suggestions for those of us living outside of those \n&gt; areas?\n&gt;  \n&gt; Ron\n&gt; STL\n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; No virus found in this incoming message.\n&gt; Checked by AVG Free Edition. \n&gt; Version: 7.5.484 / Virus Database: 269.12.2/967 - Release Date: 8/22/2007 6:51 PM\n&gt;   \n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
