It&#39;s mentioned in various sources and seems like a plausible process.  It looks a lot like the melted glaze on a piece of ceramic.  But when I talk about this with smiths they do not believe that it is possible.  They say that the surface would be burned rather than melted.  I have followed up with questions about fluxes and atmospheres that might make it possible, but haven&#39;t gotten anywhere.  However, I also haven&#39;t gotten anywhere when I ask how they think that those &quot;melted&quot; surfaces were really produced.  I&#39;m still looking for answers on this one.\n\nThere are other groups that made these &quot;melted&quot; yakite finishes.  \n\nAlso, there are a number of other explanations for the formation of tekkotsu including inhomogeneities in carbon content and subsequent wear and rusting.  I think that there is some truth in all of them.  I had a chance to glance at the link that Rich provided and I think that it is good stuff.  Busy day today, so a quick answer.\n\nJim\n\n\n  Hi Jim, on the website you write: &#39; These tsuba appear to have been\n  finished by slightly melting the surface after forging and shaping. This\n  brings out tekkotsu from the high carbon inclusions in the iron&#39;\n\n  Was this done at any other schools or is this peculiar to Kanayama? \n\n  Als if you had to translate &#39;tekkotsu&#39; in English what would it be? I\n  know what it is (at least I think I do) but I can&#39;t for the life of me\n  think what you would call it in English. \n\n  Matt\n\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
