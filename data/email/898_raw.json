The first example I can think of are Nishigaki school tsuba that often have kebori or even sukashi elements of the design entering into the seppa dai.  Not a problem for mounting and no questions about them being tsuba, but it does make me think that Kanshiro et. al. were giving some consideration to the tsuba as an individual aesthetic object and not only as an element of a koshirae.\n\nSo, this Natsuo in particular -- it looks like the relief of the kanji may be actually reduced in the seppa dai compared to the rest of the web.  It&#39;s also an even level of relief all of the way around.  I think it&#39;s &quot;mountable,&quot; although it looks like it probably has not been mounted.  (Note also that the seppa dai has been drawn in in the preparatory sketches.  He didn&#39;t forget about it.)  I have seen non-Natsuo pieces with a similar amount of &quot;relief&quot; in the seppa dai pass shinsa.  What aren&#39;t considered tsuba are for example ones with a huge figure sticking up on one side of the seppa dai and nothing on the other.\n\nAnother factor in this is that Natsuo&#39;s career straddled the edict against wearing swords and the abolition of the samurai class.  Generally pieces made after these events won&#39;t pass shinsa.  However a couple of years ago I asked whether a dated late Natsuo piece would pass or fail, the answer was something like &quot;it&#39;s complicated, isn&#39;t it.&quot;  Certainly a fair number of Natsuo guards have never been on a sword.  You&#39;ll have to decide for yourself if you consider them real sword fittings or not.\n\nJim\n\n\n\n  Is this a real tsuba?????????????!!!!!  The design goes over the seppa dai!!!\n\n  Barry (Cheeky Asshole) Thomas...\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
