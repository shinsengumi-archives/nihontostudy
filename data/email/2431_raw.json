I&#39;ve always\nrefered to these as &quot;hot stamped&quot; but really, I wonder how the smith applied\nthese stamps. The nakago being soft (not hardened), were they punched in\nafter the sword was finished? It would seem illogical to think the smith\n&quot;heated the nakago&quot; enough to &quot;hot stamp&quot; their seal. Can anyone explain how\nthis was done?\n&gt;\n&gt; A related question is about Masahide who did apply a &quot;kokuin&quot; to his\nnakago. Does anyone know if Masahide ever signed his nakago with his\n&quot;kokuin&quot; only? (Not signing his full mei with it.)\n&gt;\n&gt; Ron\n&gt; STL\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
