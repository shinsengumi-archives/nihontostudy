The tables were all full, unlike laste year  \nwhen storms back east prevented some from attending. There were  \nseveral Japanese with tables set up that had not been here in the  \nrecent past, Most notably Aoi Arts. There were exceptional swords,  \nand lots of average blades though maybe not as many swords overall  \ncompared to last year. two things of note were the number of Gassan  \nworks for sale, there were a half dozen polished and papered pieces  \nscattered through out the show room and a real chance to study  \nSadakazu, Sadakatsu and others. Also there were many more koshirae of  \nexceptional quality and interest and I enjoyed quite a bit of my time  \npouring over these.\n\tThe NTHK presented the Swords and Fittings of Mino Province, the  \nNaginata seen below is from that exhibit. The NBTHK did a  \npresentation of Tanto, 13 total as I recall, from Awataguchi Hisakuni  \nto Gassan Sadakazu. The Soshu Yukimitsu tanti which was number two on  \nthe table was my pick for best of show. There was a Soshu Hiromasa  \nOtanto (kowakizashi) in the middle of the pack that was in an older  \npolish which was a bit scuffed up but this did not prevent one from  \nseeing the quality, a fine example of the period and not the kind of  \nkoto we usually see around here.\n\tThere was an NBTHK Kantei-kai as well. With a Yosozaemon Suksada  \nyoroidoshi and a Kawai Hisayuki katana being the stand-outs. The  \nKawai blade was presented by the First Japanese Ambassadors to the US  \nto their American chaperone and it is still held in the same family.  \nA real treasure.\n\tI bought some books as one might expect, sold very few that I  \nbrought with me but I learned lots and enjoyed good company all  \nweekend. I am sure we&#39;ll here more from others as they get back to  \ntheir homes from way out west...\n-t\n\n\n  ----------\n\n\nIMG_3977.JPG\n\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
