I purchased the new, 2-vol. set of Sue-\nKoto=\r\n. I can allready tell it&#39;s going to be very educational. I went \nto all the=\r\n lectures - the Kodogu & Tsuba lectures (by Gilbert & \nRobson) were the bes=\r\nt. Benson lectured on Bizen swords and I was able \nto admire and study 5 of=\r\n them. \n\nThis is my second time to attend this show. I decided to have my o=\r\nwn \ntable and actually sold some of the wonderful Tsuba that I own (I own \n=\r\ntoo many!). I was very glad to meet Robert Haynes. He is so happy to \nanswe=\r\nr any and all questions that anyone ask&#39;s. I ask him plenty and \nwas educat=\r\ned in the process. \n\nThe only head-ache occured coming and going at the SF =\r\nairport. I had \na Security Weapon case to carry 2 swords - allmost lost, re=\r\npeatedly \nsearched, I could go on and on. \n\nI have a question..........What=\r\n is the web-site address for the NTHK? \nI am contemplating joining. I hear =\r\nthey have a good &#39;novice&#39; course \nabout Nihonto.\n\nThanks,\nElliott\n\n\n\n\n"
