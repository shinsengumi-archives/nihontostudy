There are guards signed Kaga, Owari, Echizen, Akasaka, etc.\n  Nobuie.  Sometimes the work style of a particular later guard with only a\n  two-character signature can be tied back to one of these.  I don&#39;t think\n  that I have ever seen a formal kanteisho written attributing a\n  two-character-signed guard to a specific regional Edo period maker, though.\n  I have seen an NBTHK kanteisho written to &quot;Nobuie (Edo period)&quot; to show that\n  it is not a forgery, but is one of the later makers.  I have seen another\n  written to &quot;betsujin Nobuie,&quot; meaning a different person, i.e., not the\n  famous maker(s).  I have also seen good quality, early Edo period tsuba\n  signed Nobuie fail shinsa as forgeries.\n\n  Most of those follow-on makers didn&#39;t try (or weren&#39;t able) to reproduce the flavor of the\n  iron and rim of the original guards, though.  They use classic designs, but\n  the plate is more like typical early-mid Edo period work.  It became the\n  fashion during the late Edo period to produce copies of the earlier style.\n  Some of these late works are signed by shinshinto sword smiths or Myochin\n  makers and can be quite nice.  The two Norisuke were famous for faking\n  Nobuie, Yamakichibei, Yagyu, etc., guards.  The way that the rim is worked\n  here seems like it&#39;s from that period and might even be their work.  There\n  is a definite attempt to recreate the original style, but the result is forced and overdone.  \n\n   Photos are no substitute for seeing a piece in\n  person.  I can&#39;t see the signature very well in the photo, but the quality\n  of the metal and workmanship are harder to fake than a signature.\n\n\n\n\n\n  Gimei Nobuiye?\n\n  my question is how can you tell?\n  It looks awfully similar to the ones in the books!\n\n  And if it is indeed gimei, how old is it do we think?\n\n  Matt\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
