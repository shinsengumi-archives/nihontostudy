When I think about these concerns I sometimes wonder about us modern concervators. I think we &quot;think&quot; too much. We know what should &quot;not&quot; be done to iron tsuba and as for what &quot;should be done,&quot; well, I think it is just common sense to &quot;handle&quot; them to enhance their &quot;aging&quot; and otherwise, let them age without making such a fuss over them. Kinko fittings require more care than iron but iron tsuba love gentle handling. Again, common sense prevails. \n\nRon\nSTL\n\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: Curran Campbell \n  To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com ; nihonto@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Wednesday, September 07, 2005 2:18 PM\n  Subject: [nihontostudy] Tsuba care question\n\n\n  List-\n\n  Between intervals of carrying old iron tsuba in the\n  back jeans pocket to give them a slow polish, it has\n  been traditionally advised to give them a rub with\n  flannel. Over lots and lots of time, the flannel thing\n  works... very slowly.\n\n  _My main question_: what are the pros and cons of\n  using non-dyed (aka homespun) denim /instead of\n  flannel/ to rub the faces of the tsuba?\n\n  _Secondary question_: In jeans pocket, it seems the\n  mimi takes on too much polish while the face gets only\n  slightly polished. What are the opinions of aesthetic\n  about this? Should degree of Mimi polish and face\n  polish be equal, or would Hagihara and other Japanese\n  authorities recommend more polish on the mimi and less\n  wear on the face especially the seppa dai area, as\n  would happen to a mounted tsuba over time as it rubbed\n  against the silk/cotton of its owner&#39;s kimono?\n\n  Curran\n\n\n  __________________________________________________\n  Do You Yahoo!?\n  Tired of spam?
