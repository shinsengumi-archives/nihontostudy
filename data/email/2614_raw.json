The nakago and hitsu ana look &#39;too regular and wrongly shaped&#39; on the\nKuwabara tsuba.\n2. The mei seems to be placed a bit too low in relation to the nakago ana\nand the characters are slightly too far apart(?)\n3. Specifically the second character looks like it is completely out of\nplace, much too low, nearly next to the bottom of the nakago ana. On the\ngenuine examples the second character is much higher up on all of them.\n\nDoes anyone have any more comments? I think this makes quite an interesting\nexercise for the newbies like myself.

The first thing one would\n&gt; what to do is to consult the book of Akiyama collected Nobuiye (title\n&gt; escapes me without reference material here) which illustrates the vast\n&gt; bulk of know Nobuiye out there. A few years ago a well known California\n&gt; dealer was lucky enough to find one at a show, bought it and it\n&gt; eventually went Juyo. Sure enough is found among the Akiyama oshigata.\n&gt; You can be quite sure that if such a tsuba left Japan and were correct\n&gt; the price would have at least another zero on the end, and probably an\n&gt; initial digit change as well.\n&gt;  Arnold\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; matthewhoyle@... 01/30/05 5:32 PM &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Gimei Nobuiye?\n&gt;\n&gt; http://www.nihonto.com/11.28.04.html\n&gt;\n&gt; Mr. Weissberg evidently thinks it is gimei, my question is how can you\n&gt; tell?\n&gt; It looks awfully similar to the ones in the books!\n&gt;\n&gt; And if it is indeed gimei, how old is it do we think?\n&gt;\n&gt; Matt\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
