I don&#39;t have an attribution for it, but I agree with \nyour late Edo period date.  The combination of the naturalistic \nrendering of the grass and the schematic style of the cricket is \ninteresting.  The carving of the grass resembles Choshu/Bushu style, \nalthough of course many others did the same, and the style of the \ncricket is a lot like the sukashi &quot;drawing&quot; style in Akasaka work.\n&gt; \n&gt; Jim \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   Dear colleagues\n&gt; \n&gt;   I should be grateful for any pointers that you can offer me \n&gt;   regarding an attribution for the tsuba illustrated in my photo \nalbum \n&gt;   JPL.  It is of a violet/black shakudo, and was purchased by its \n&gt;   previous owner in 1938.  It depicts, in a delicate openwork, a \nbell \n&gt;   cricket amidst suzuki grasses.  The grass is decorated with gold \n&gt;   taka-zogan dewdrops.\n&gt; \n&gt;   I have always thought, by reason of the &#39;brightness&#39; of its \n&gt;   execution, the lack of any evidence of it ever having been \nmounted, \n&gt;   and sekigane in the nakago-hitsu that appear more decorative \nthan \n&gt;   functional, that it was Edo work.\n&gt; \n&gt;   During a recent visit to the Bing exhibition, at the Van Gough \n&gt;   Museum in Amsterdam, I saw a very similar guard on loan from the \n&gt;   Museum fur Kunst et Kewerbe in Hamburg - stupidly I omitted to \n&gt;   record its accession number.  This was attributed to Nakai \nZensuke \n&gt;   Tomotsune I (1669 -1730.  Can I be so wrong in the dating of my \nown \n&gt;   tsuba?\n&gt; \n&gt;   With my thanks in advance for any suggestions\n&gt;   John L.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n\n"
