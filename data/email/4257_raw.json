As \nSoumin studied under Goto masters and was one of the founders of \nMa=\r\nchibori I find it interesting he here is using the open/closed end \nposts s=\r\nuch as the mainline Goto masters often used.  Having come \nacross an articl=\r\ne by Thomas B. Buttweiler, &#39;The History of Pre-Edo \nMenuki&#39;, Token TaiKai 1=\r\n976, on pp. 62 & 63 the following is noted:\n\n     &quot;By the end of the Dolmen=\r\n Period the Tsuka ornaments had been \nmodified to function as Mekugi.  Beca=\r\nuse of the constraints placed on \nMenuki, the size was reduced and the desi=\r\ngn became rounded and more \ncompact.  These first Menuki were made to be an=\r\n integral part of the \nMekugi.  The solid pin of one Menuki extended throug=\r\nh the Mekugi-Ana \nof the sword and was capped on the other side of the Tsuk=\r\na by the \nhollow cylindrical pin of the matching Menuki.  This hollow-solid=\r\n \ncylindrical arrangement remained standard in the Goto School for five \nhu=\r\nndred years after the Menuki ceased to be an integral part of the \nMekugi.\n=\r\n\n     By the end of the Nara Period the wrapped Tsuka came into common \nuse=\r\n.  This inovation sounded the death knell of the integral Mekugi-\nMenuki.  =\r\nSince the tight wrapping allowed virtually no space between \nadjacent turns=\r\n, the Mekugi-Menuki had to be mounted over the Tsuka-\nIto.  The softness of=\r\n the wrap allowed the pins to move relative to \none another.  The subsequen=\r\nt metal to metal wear, resulted in loss of \nadhesion, with the possible dis=\r\nappearance of one Menuki.  An \nalternate method of external mounting was at=\r\ntempted.  This consisted \nof mounting the two Menuki on an independent wood=\r\nen Mekugi.  The \nmounting was accomplished using a hollow cylindrical pin i=\r\nn each \nMenuki, to fit over the Mekugi proper.  This approach was doomed to=\r\n \nfailure for the same reasons stated earlier.  The double hollow \ncylindri=\r\ncal pin arrangement, remained as a vestige of this mounting \ntechnique, unt=\r\nil the Muromachi Period, in the Ezo School.\n\n     These two attempts at usi=\r\nng externally mounted Menuki, either \nattached to or made part of the Mekug=\r\ni, can only be classed as \ntransitional.  From a functional standpoint they=\r\n were doomed to \nfailure from the onset.\n\n     Even though the Menuki could=\r\n not be mounted as part of the \nmekugi, tradition dictated that the Menuki =\r\nbe retained.  They were \ninserted under the wraps using the rather feeble j=\r\nustifiaction that \ntheir use improved the warriors grip on the sword.\n\n    =\r\n Aside from the debate over the dubious functionality of wrapped \nMenuki, t=\r\nhey had, by the end of the Heian Period, become an \nestablished member of t=\r\nhe compliment of Kodogu.  Their status has \nremained, except for variation =\r\nof motif, unchanged up to the present \nday&quot;.\n\n     I still have to wonder i=\r\nf there is a known justification for the \ninclusion of this arrangement or =\r\nif it is simply a nod to tradition?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
