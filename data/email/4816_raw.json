Not quite sure what that is =\r\nbut I&#39;ve more than a few times have (as most of us have) sold off fittings =\r\nseperately from the sword. (Unless, I should add, the sword is nicely mount=\r\ned in a relatively complete and intact koshirae.) \n\nAs for a sword like thi=\r\ns being worth much more after being &quot;appraised, documented or auctioned,&quot; o=\r\nne has to realize that these directions take money to do these things. I&#39;m =\r\nnot sure what a reliable appraiser would charge today but for a stateside &quot;=\r\npaper&quot; you would pay around $250; to send a sword to Japan it might run $1,=\r\n200 (Tokubetsu Hozon) after you are finished with shipping and fees and reg=\r\nistrations. Auction houses charge seller fees and catalogue fees. Nothing c=\r\nomes cheap! \n\nJust rattling on a bit...\n\nRon\nSTL\n\n  ----- Original Message =\r\n----- \n  From: BECKY WALLACE \n  To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: S=\r\naturday, January 06, 2007 4:36 PM\n  Subject: [nihontostudy] Becky&#39;s Sword\n\n=\r\n\n  I&#39;d like to thank everyone who has been helping me with Japanese Sword i=\r\nnfo lately. We did go to the Gun show here in Dallas today. Sold the WWII J=\r\napanese rifle we had - it was not a very good piece and I&#39;m glad to have it=\r\n out of the closet. Had several people look at the sword. The blade, as has=\r\n been pointed out by some of you, was not signed and it has one nick that i=\r\ns slightly too big to be polished out, which detracts considerably from the=\r\n value. There was concurance that this sword was made in the 1600s and is a=\r\n Washika (spelling) the shoter sword. Everyone liked the tsuba, end cap and=\r\n collar. I got offered about $500 for the tsuba and $100 each for the colla=\r\nr and end cap, but just $300 for the whole thing! The conclusion I came to =\r\nwas that a gun show was really more like a giant pawn shop than the place t=\r\no really get a fair assessment of value, but it was very interesting, I ran=\r\n into at least 3 of my co-workiers from Lockheed who had booths, and I did =\r\ncome\n  away knowing a few things: 1. the sword is old and really not in bad=\r\n shape - I can continue to use it in the event of an intruder and could pro=\r\nbably take one out with it - I&#39;m not a handgun fan :-) 2. If I really had i=\r\nt appraised, documented, or auctioned, I&#39;d get $1500 or so for it, 3. I lik=\r\ne it more than that so will be keeping it for the forseeable future. I&#39;ll p=\r\nrobably drop out of this group in a few weeks having accomplished my missio=\r\nn, but thanks for the education. I can sure see how this could become a ver=\r\ny interesting hobby.\n\n  Becky\n\n  [Non-text portions of this message have be=\r\nen removed]\n\n\n\n   \n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n=\r\n\n"
