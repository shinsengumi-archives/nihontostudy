My guess would be that it is\n&gt; Shoami,=\r\n and most probably, Kyo Shoami. Nice floral these, we\n&gt; can&#39;t tell a lot ab=\r\nout the iron due to the colour of your\n&gt; photo&#39;s unfortunately but if in go=\r\nod condition without cracks\n&gt; or serous damage, then this sort of thing mig=\r\nht\n&gt; sell on Ebay for between $300 - $400.00\n\nThanks for the quick replies,=\r\n Richard and klepet. I&#39;ve uploaded better \npictures at http://tinyurl.com/8=\r\nvzen and http://tinyurl.com/brcqz . My \nmother only paid about $10 for it.\n=\r\n\nI&#39;ve got a couple of questions, if you don&#39;t mind.\n\nIf it&#39;s Kyo Shoami, do=\r\nes that mean it was made in Kyoto? Am I right in \nguessing that it&#39;s from t=\r\nhe early Edo period? 1650ish?\n\nThe Kogai Hitsu-ana is filled out like on ma=\r\nny other Tsuba I&#39;ve seen \npictures of online. Was this done to enforce the =\r\nstructure or as part \nof repairs or for some other reason? Would it have ha=\r\nppened much later \nin time? The same goes for the fillers in the Nakago-ana=\r\n.\n\nWere all Tsuba mounted on weapons or were they used elsewhere as e.g. \nd=\r\necoration? Any chance mine might&#39;ve seen battle? :-)\n\nI&#39;m reading up on the=\r\n topic, but I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll think of other \nquestions.\n\nThanks again,\n\nPetter=\r\n\n\n\n\n\n"
