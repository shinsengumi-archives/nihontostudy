I&#39;d say generally avoid it as not being fiscally sound.\n\nThat said I think the NTHK has much better prices on papering tsuba that\nmake more sense than the NBTHK. I was considering NTHK papers for mine.\n\n- darcy\n   \n&lt;jdz@...&gt; writes:\n\n&gt; I&#39;ve never submitted anything for papers, and just to experience the process I was thinking of submitting one or two tsuba to shinsa.  \n\n&gt; But looking at the costs, and not believing I own any more than Hozon-level sorts of tsuba, I began to wonder if it made sense to spend several hundred dollars just to add minimum Hozon papers, or perhaps to fail.  \n\n&gt; Any wisdom out there on how good a tsuba needs to be to be Hozon or Tokubetsu Hozon?  Why paper a tsuba at all?  What makes you decide to submit a particular one?\n\n&gt; DZ\n\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n\n \n&gt; Yahoo!
