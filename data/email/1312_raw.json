Otherwise, its the sort\nof tsuba I think of as &#39;Umetada&#39;.\n   Mark&#39;s tsuba is very different. Anyone feel up to\nteaching us both about Umetadas or pointing us to good\nreferences? So far I&#39;ve read only the Art&Sword\narticle and the Nihon_To_Koza.

I&#39;ve been told the\n&gt; &gt; mei reads Umetada.  \n&gt; &gt; All of the Umetada School Tsubas I&#39;ve seen\n&gt; pictures\n&gt; &gt; of are non-\n&gt; &gt; pierced.
