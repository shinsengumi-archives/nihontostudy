It is known that Department of \nJustice had been in contact with local martial arts organisations (Iaido \nAssociation of Ireland is particular) is order to avoid unnecessary \nrestrictions for martial arts practitioneers and authentic sword collectors. \nIn the light of recent global trends to regulate possession and \ntransportation of &#39;samurai&#39; swords (which sometimes comes in quite \nnarrow-minded forms) the new Irish legislation appears to be reasonable, \nespecially taking into account the (more than modest) size of the local \nsword scene. Mirroring the UK sword ban which was introduced in April 2008 \nas one of the questionable measures to fight &#39;knife crime&#39;, authentic \nhand-made Japanese swords (Nihonto) are exempt (however I couldn&#39;t yet find \nany reference to whether sports equipment such as iaito and shinken is to be \nbanned or not).\n\nThe real concern is the practical side of the legislation and the way it&#39;s \ngoing to be implemented. There&#39;s been numerous occasions in UK since \nintroduction of the sword ban when law-abiding collectors had trouble \nimporting antique swords. It&#39;s perfectly understandable due to the fact that \nin order for Customs to make sure that it&#39;s legal to import a sword, some \nsort of cerfificate required proving its age and provenance. And the most \ncommon cert of this kind (if any) is the NBTHK paper hand-written in \nJapanese. No wonder Customs officers, sorting office workers and law \nenforcement authorities would not be able to take it as a supportive \ndocumentation without difficult (and costly) translation.And this is the \nneigbouring UK which is much more accustomed to importing/exporting Japanese \ncollectible weapons than Irish. How many Customs officers and An Post \nemployees were instructed about differences between replica and authentic \nJapanese swords or even have seen ones? Will they be collector-friendly or \ntake an eBay approach and stop any import of &#39;illegal samurai-like swords&#39; \nunless (with immense trouble) proven otherwise? If temporarily or \npermanently seized, will real Nihonto be given a proper care?\n\nThere is no doubt that circulation of cheap and dangerous replica had to be \nstopped, even with the level or crime involving samurai swords being \nridiculously low in comparison to the usage of widely available home \nutensils.But will the fair treatment of martial arts practitioners and sword \ncollectors be guaranteed? Time will tell.\n\n\n\n"
