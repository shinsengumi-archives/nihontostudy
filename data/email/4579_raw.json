In part, this had been due to the lack of a clearly defined categorisatio=\r\nn, making systematic attribution of the group difficult and thus preventing=\r\n coherent study of the corpus as a whole. Dr John Lissenden uses this redef=\r\ninition as the starting point in his accessible, creative and thoroughly re=\r\nsearched study of Namban tsuba, for which he was awarded the degree of Mast=\r\ner of Arts in East Asian Studies by the University of Durham in 2002.\n\nThe =\r\nauthor has made good use of the research that has been previously done by E=\r\nuropean and Japanese students, but has also been originally critical of som=\r\ne of the established scholarship. This approach has allowed him to present =\r\ninterpretations of Namban tsuba that are indeed new.\nAmong collectors and c=\r\nurators, some aspects of this study will be debated =97 even contested =97 =\r\nbut the clarity of the author=92s position will cause them to reconsider so=\r\nme of their originally held beliefs.\n\nCollectors also will value this study=\r\n because it presents an innovative categorisation of this previously neglec=\r\nted group of sword guards, and serves to clarify the diversity and relation=\r\nships of the Namban style. Including, as it does, expositions on both gildi=\r\nng and casting as related to this group of tsuba, the author=92s reappraisa=\r\nl also uses the data on sword furniture as a new source of insight and info=\r\nrmation on historical developments in East Asia during the 16th to 18th cen=\r\nturies.\n\nB&W - http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1554043654/002-3046604-2029=\r\n634\n\nPaperback - Color - http://www.lulu.com/content/360453\n\nHardback - Col=\r\nor - http://www.lulu.com/content/361355\n_________________\nhttp://www.derond=\r\nouglas.com\nhttp://www.double-dragon-ebooks.com\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this=\r\n message have been removed]\n\n\n"
