The hamon running off \nthe=\r\n kissaki IS a fatal flaw, make no bones about that. Swords with fatal \nflaw=\r\ns that make Tokubetsu Hozon, Juyo or Yashu saku are swords of \nextraordinar=\r\ny worth, and a flaw that is fatal can not take away it&#39;s \nhistory. These sw=\r\nords are typically famous because they are rare, or \nwere carried by someon=\r\ne important or famous. General swords, made by the \nnot so famous sword smi=\r\nths, no matter how nice will most likely fail all \nattempts at kanteisho if=\r\n theirs is a fatal flaw like the hamon running \noff the Ha or Kissaki, a Ha=\r\ngiri and the likes.\n\nWe all learn hard lessons and we never like being told=\r\n that our hard \nearned and well spent money if for naught, but this is a mu=\r\ngs game, it \ntakes nerves of steel and a firm resolve. All I can suggest is=\r\n to get \nover it and move on. I mean that in the nicest possible way. I am =\r\nnot \ntrying to be smart, just realistic.\n\nGood luck\n\nRichard Turner\n\n\n\nElli=\r\nott wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I was complaining about learning nothing from shinsa (NY 200=\r\n6)other\n&gt; than a falling off temperline in the tip is (maybe) a fatal flaw.=\r\n\n&gt; Since I am definitly a &#39;newbee&#39; and I study, study, study, I found\n&gt; som=\r\nething called YAKIOTOSHI. I also studyied the JUYO BIJUTSU HIN and\n&gt; TOKUBE=\r\nTSU JUYO blades that have this wonderful feature. Yakiotoshi is\n&gt; of no con=\r\ncern, infact an attribute to old, Koto swords.\n&gt;\n&gt; I am happier to find thi=\r\ns out myself from studying than to have\n&gt; nothing told to me after a shinsa=\r\n. What they could have said, &quot;This is\n&gt; a Koto blade possibly made by Sukes=\r\nada but we won&#39;t paper it due to\n&gt; the temperline running off in the tip&quot;. =\r\nEven without paper, thats\n&gt; money well spent.\n&gt;\n&gt; Elliott\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n\n\n[Non-text=\r\n portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
