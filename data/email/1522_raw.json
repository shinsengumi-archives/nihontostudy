Of course Hizen, and\nNagasaki in particular, was the major point of contact with foreigners\nand their goods.  Guards made in Europe or China would have been seen\nfirst in Hizen.  A lot of the foreign-influenced styles of &quot;nanban\ntsuba&quot; were probably initially made in Hizen.  The &quot;dragon and vines&quot;\ntype is so numerous that it was probably mass produced in other parts of\nJapan.\n\nI&#39;m sure that you can find exceptions in the usage, but most of the time\nthe term Hizen is used for solid plate, iron guards with profuse, showy\nsilver or multi-color nunome.  The motifs are often foreign-influenced,\nthe plates are sometimes cupped like European guards, and they do share\nsome decorative traits with the &quot;dragon and vines&quot; type like dragon\nmotifs and a rectangular seppa dai (although in the case of the Hizen\ntsuba, it&#39;s usually just outlined with nunome).  I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever\nseen the dragon and vines type called Hizen.\n\nThere seems to be some consensus that the earliest nanban tsuba from the\nlate 16th to early 17th C were made outside of Japan.  I think that is\nwhat Graham is talking about and they are rather rare.  The huge\nmajority of pieces that we see in &quot;dragon in vines&quot; style are later and\nmade in Japan.\n\nForeign influence found its way into arts beyond tsuba.  There were\nvarious nanban-style wares made in Japan, lacquer chests and furnishings\n(even nanban saya), clothing, painting, etc.  The nanban items made in\nJapan must far outnumber the imported ones that inspired them.\n\nJim\n\n\n\n  Gang, going off topic a little, but still on the Graham Gemmel Book,\nat\n  one point he discusses a nanban type tsuba with the very busy &#39;dragon\nin\n  vines&#39; type of decoration that is associated with &#39;Canton&#39; style. \n\n  He reckons that these tsuba were actually made in China and India,\nwhere\n  they were ordered by the Dutch who then sold them in Japan! \n\n  He goes on to say that alot of these tsuba were actually made\nsomewhere\n  other than Japan, and they are quite different to Nanban tsuba, which\n  simply means in &#39;foreign taste&#39; or done in &#39;foreign metal&#39; etc etc. \n\n  And while we are on the subject, what is the difference between Hizen\n  and Nanban tsuba? They must have alot in common simply because they\nwere\n  probably made in more or less the same place I assume?\n\n  Matt\n\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n  _____  \n\nYahoo!
