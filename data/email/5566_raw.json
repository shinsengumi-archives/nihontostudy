I have  \n&gt; found the copy of the letter as well as=\r\n the book inscribed to Dr  \n&gt; Compton.   I am still looking for a note that=\r\n I found in another  \n&gt; book.   It is some scribbling about a sword that I =\r\nassume that BW  \n&gt; Robinson was studying.    If you don&#39;t mind, I will look=\r\n a little  \n&gt; more for that.   If I don&#39;t find it, then I will just send th=\r\nese.    \n&gt; If you are pressed for time, I can send you these and whenever I=\r\n run  \n&gt; across the other again try to find your address and send it.    \n&gt;=\r\n CHeers, Bob\n&gt; On Feb 19, 2009, at 5:11 PM, excelsiorilluminati wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; Hi Bob, may I get photos of the letter and inscription in the book or\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; scan?

One is a co=\r\npy of his\n&gt; &gt; book signed with a inscription\n&gt; &gt; &gt; when he gave it to Dr Co=\r\nmpton - very cool, but not much information\n&gt; &gt; content, just a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; refer=\r\nence to happy sword collecting. The other is a letter from\n&gt; &gt; Robinson (wh=\r\no had amazing\n&gt; &gt; &gt; penmanship) to the owner of a sword that I now own desc=\r\nribing at\n&gt; &gt; length who made the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; sword, where it was made etc. Let m=\r\ne know if this would be of any\n&gt; &gt; interest.
