See Lot 360 in\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Sotheby&#39;s &quot;6152 TOKAIDO&quot; sale in New York April 24 & 25 1991.\n\nAndres Pedraza asked:\n\n&gt;&gt; Please! Not all of us have a 15-year old Auction catalogue collection\n&gt;&gt; (yet). Tell us briefly how it&#39;s improved or deteriorated in the interim.\n\nand Mark Jaillet also asked:\n\n&gt; YES, a brief explanation Barry would be great.\n\nApologies for the delay, but I didn&#39;t want to comment on an auction in progress.\nIt was quite enough, I thought, to give a heads up to anyone contemplating the\nLot in question.  In the event it brought 24,000 English pounds...\n\nI give credit here to a friend of mine who presented me with the image of Lot\n180 in the present auction and asked &quot;Do you see anything wrong with this?&quot;\nMmmmm, I didn&#39;t.  Then he brought out his 1991 Sotheby&#39;s catalogue.  In 1991 the\ntanto tsuka was bound with ito over (I think) white same, and the &quot;ring menuki&quot;\nwas placed centrally in the tsuka.  In the present auction the tsuka is unbound\nwith a black-lacquered same, and the &quot;ring menuki&quot; (it has a special name I\ncan&#39;t recall) is placed further toward the kashira.  My friend regarded this as\na poor quality repair because it did not faithfully replicate the original form\nas the kashira is of the type with &quot;eyelets&quot; for tsukaito to go through, and not\nthe type for an unbound tsuka.  My friend is very, very experienced in koshirae\nand lacquer repair and meticulous in being faithful to the original form\nwherever possible.  His hilt binding is of such quality with silk tsukaito that\nI wouldn&#39;t send a tsuka to Japan for binding.  His lacquer repairs have to be\nseen before and after to be believed....\n\nSo, Gentle People, that&#39;s all there is to it.\n\nBest regards,\n\nBarry Thomas\n(Melbourne, Australia)\n\n"
