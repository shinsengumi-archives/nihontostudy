I am looking into the significance of this shrine is in regards to kodogu as it is a popular theme. The shrine itself is of the pagoda style, and on the Internet, I have so far found many reference pics of this and also the mention of Genji, with the shrine being a favorite visiting place. . \n\nThere is also a few references showing the Tori used in the tsuba&#39;s design described at the main gate or entrance to the shrine. I assume as the tori and the pine tree&#39;s are used the most in tsuba design, they are significant in recognizing the shrine. \n\nIs it the Shrine that is the main theme here, or the shrine through the reference of Genji ?, or is Genji the main point and the shrine is being used as reference ?.\n\nToshu Ju Kuniyoshi Saku\nhttp://www.whiz.com.au/richard/Tsuba/kuniyoshi-front.jpg\n\nSumiyoshi Shrine Tori\nhttp://kyushu.com/images/places_to_go/pup_sumiyoshi_left_pic.jpg&quot;\n\nCheers all\n\nRich\n\n\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
