I hope that you make the hassle contacting the police, because ebay is the most awful place white-washing money and a place for stolen things where you very eassy get cheeted. My &quot; case &quot; where I boughte a Kiyosada sword from feb. 2004 has just now reached FBI and I am not very possitive about getting the sword I have bought. But I hope that if peable, like I did, report ebay to the police, FBI etc. force ebay to higher the ethical level and make it more secure to use ebay and the Net. All the best wishes for you\nAllan\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: bungotakadasword \n  To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Monday, October 11, 2004 12:53 PM\n  Subject: [nihontostudy] Re: Check this out! stolen sword\n\n\n\n  --- In nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com, Tom Helm &lt;junkmail@t...&gt; wrote:\n  &gt; Read the description!\n  &gt; \n  &gt; http://tinyurl.com/5afv5\n  &gt; \n  &gt;\n\n  http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&?\n  ViewItem&item=2276357713\n  this is the sword &quot; stolen &quot; ( or missing ) from my hotel room in \n  Chicago.\n  To keep life simple ,I am trying to buy it back from the seller with \n  no question ask.\n  I do have the shinsa worksheet and pics to prove ownership, so please \n  do not bid on this item.\n  I don&#39;t want the hassle of contacting Chicago Police, e-Bay  etc. if \n  anyone bid and win this &quot; stolen &quot; item.\n  Thank you all,\n\n  Milt\n\n\n\n\n        Yahoo!
