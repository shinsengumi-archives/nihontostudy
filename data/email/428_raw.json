I still have an\nawful lot to learn, but I enjoy it and that is important. \n \n- Matt \n\n-----Oorspronkelijk bericht-----\nVan: Jim Gilbert [mailto:jggilbert@...] \nVerzonden: zondag 29 juni 2003 7:20\nAan: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com\nOnderwerp: Re: [nihontostudy] Early sukashi tsuba attribution\n\n\nMatt,\nVery good calls -- well done.  However, I have to say that Akasaka would\nbe difficult to defend.  That mokko shape would be very unusual for\nAkasaka.  Their seppa dai tended to be more narrow and were often\nsomewhat to very pointed at the top in the early generations.  The broad\nshape would be, again unusual.  They didn&#39;t normally do quadrilateral\nsymmetry like that and the hitsuana are also not typical, although\nTadashige often made &quot;dovetails&quot; for (often non-existent) sekigane like\nwe see here on the kozuka ana side.  Akasaka construction often used a\nhard, smooth kawagane that looks quite different from the texture of the\niron on this guard.  The rim is usually very round in the early\ngenerations.\n\nBUT... there are a bunch of signed Akasaka guards by later generations\nthat are not obviously in Akasaka style based on the carving, motifs and\neven inlay.  It&#39;s an interesting study.   The first Akasaka died around\n1657, FWIW.  Pretty sure it&#39;s not an Akasaka piece, though.\n\nWriting opinions is a great way to learn.  Keep it up and don&#39;t worry\nabout the feet.  You did good.\n\nJim\n\n\n  This is my totally uninformed novice opinion. So feel free to put your\n  foot in if I am way off base here.  Anyway with that disclaimer gone\n  here goes (I have to try sometime haha)\n\n  My first guess would be Kyoto for the first tsuba, second guess\nAkasaka,\n  whatever it is dating to the (early) 1600&#39;s\n\n  Second tsuba: I am inclined to agree with Tom, early simple Onin. \n\n  How did I do ? \n\n  - Matt \n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\nYahoo!
