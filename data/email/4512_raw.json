The key is of\ncourse recognition. Do many people=\r\n recognize your style as having\npractical, spiritual and cultural value, en=\r\nough that your style will\ncontinue long after your passing. Do otherwise un=\r\niterested parties\nrecognize what you are doing as Japanese Swordsmanship or=\r\n at least\nswordsmanship. Finally does the pioneer himself recognize the\ncon=\r\ntributions of past masters, and that it takes really big cahones to\npronoun=\r\nce to the world they have broken with tradition and started his\nown way and=\r\n how that might rub folks the wrong way no matter how good\nor how logical h=\r\nis new style may be.\n\nyou might go to the Iaido/l list at the University of=\r\n Guelph, or\nswordforum.com for some other opinions.\n\nYou didn&#39;t ask but, my=\r\n advice would be to align yourself with an\nestablish tradition, then work h=\r\nard and if you&#39;re lucky enough, open\nyour own dojo. You get to teach what y=\r\nou like and you&#39;re students will\nbe part of something bigger than the backy=\r\nard Ryuha. and for goodness\nsakes if you aren&#39;t Japanese don&#39;t give it a Ja=\r\npanese name...\nMHO\n-t \n\n\n\n\n"
