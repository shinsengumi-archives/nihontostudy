But given the relatively small percentage of gold in even high quality shakudo, I doubt that it&#39;d be practical to do kantei by weight.  \n\n  I&#39;m not sure how a copper alloy plate from Mino or decorated in Mino style would have a different weight from one of comparable size decorated somewhere else.  If anything, the deeply cut type of Mino-bori tsuba could tend to feel a little lighter than expected for its size due to the material removed.  \n\n  Fortunately kantei of Mino work by visual cues is pretty reliable.\n  Jim\n  -------------------------------\n  Gang,\n  An advance collector told me the &quot; weight &quot; plays a part in the \n  kantei too......... mino works are supposed to be &quot; heavy &quot;.\n\n  Jim et al, your thoughts on this ?\n\n\n  Milt\n\n\n\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  Yahoo!
