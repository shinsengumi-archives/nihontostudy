Point up the fun of our chosen interest, eh? My thinking is why spend the money on a sword like this unless there is &quot;something&quot; there that would encourage one to look further. As Peter Bleed pointed out, the nakago has been thoroughly &quot;drilled&quot; but even that can be fixed (plugged) if so desired. My guess (gut feeling/impression) as to kantei would be on the fence; possibly late koto/early shinto work, leaning towards late koto.\n\nFun stuff, we enjoy, eh?\n\nRon\nSTL\n\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: Peter Farrar \n  To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Wednesday, March 17, 2004 5:42 AM\n  Subject: [nihontostudy] Will this Katana polish?\n\n\n  Hi,\n\n  Can anyone give me an opinion if this Katana blade would polish?\n\n  I believe it to be a shinshinto Katana, the blade (cutting edge 26 \n  1/4&quot;) is very heavy and thick.\n\n  Its badly corroded and pitted on one side of the blade, the other \n  side has only minor pitting and corrosion. The worst areas (deep \n  pitting) are pictured in the link. The blade is still very sharp \n  along the entire edge. The hamon is not visible at all.\n\n  Thanks for any help.\n\n  Images:\n\n  http://www.c.farrar.btinternet.co.uk/kat/\n\n  Peter\n\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  Yahoo!
