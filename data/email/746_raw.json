Can&#39;t say this with too much authority but I would think Saotome plate would be thinner and of a better quality than Tembo. Will look forward to seeing what Jim and others will say about this. \n\nRon\nSTL\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: alchemyst \n  To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Saturday, September 06, 2003 3:42 PM\n  Subject: [nihontostudy] Tembo - Saotome Q\n\n\n  I recently acquired the following tsuba.\n\n  http://gcclearn.gcc.vccs.edu/stein/tembo2.jpg\n\n  It is 84 cm and is papered to Tempo by the NTHK.\n\n  My question - why tembo and not Saotome? The are\n  no stamps on the plate only sukashi and possibly\n  a few brass ten-zogan. The style of plate, sukashi,\n  etc. to me say Saotome. Recognizing that Tembo is\n  an outgrowth of Saotome, I still don&#39;t see why this\n  was papered to Tembo instead of Saotome. Any thoughts\n  appreciated.\n\n  Thanks\n  Rich S\n\n\n        Yahoo!
