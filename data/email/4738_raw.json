It is amazing \nhow similar w=\r\neapons and strategies develop as a result of similar \nnecessities. Anyhow, =\r\nwith the development of the teppo and the \ngreater use of ashigaru in melee=\r\n use of the pole arm declined, \nhowever it never disappeared as a strategic=\r\n weapon against cavalry. \nIf I recall correctly even during the American ci=\r\nvil war there were \ntroops of billmen to repulse cavalry attack. The spear =\r\nin many \ncultures was the primary weapon as was the yari on early \nbattlefi=\r\nelds. Again surviving until the 19th century including for \nexample the var=\r\nious mounted lancers brigades. Polearms are a vital \npart of Japanese histo=\r\nry and can&#39;t be ignored, these books help. John\n\n\n\n\n--- In nihontostudy@yah=\r\noogroups.com, &quot;Mark Jaillet&quot; &lt;mjaillet@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi Andres,\n&gt; =A0=A0=\r\n=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 Nice to see someo=\r\nne else out there interested \nin=A0these\n&gt; wonderful polearms. Knutsen&#39;s bo=\r\nok is one of the only ones in \nenglish that I\n&gt; am aware of. Are you a &quot;pra=\r\nctitioner&quot; of Naginata or simply looking \nto study\n&gt; them?\n&gt; Another book y=\r\nou may want to look at is; Naginata - The Definitive \nGuide by\n&gt; Dr. Alexan=\r\nder Bennett.=A0 It is only available through;\n&gt; HYPERLINK &quot;http://www.kendo=\r\n-world.com&quot;www.kendo-world.com=A0=A0=A0=A0 A \nwarning\n&gt; though; the supplie=\r\nrs have a &quot;reputation&quot; for being slow with their \norders.\n&gt; I placed an ord=\r\ner 2 weeks ago and there hasn&#39;t been any movement on \nmy\n&gt; credit card or e=\r\nven an e-mail confirmation of my request.=A0 Expect a \nwait of\n&gt; 3-4 months=\r\n! With that said, the book comes with some glowing \nreviews since\n&gt; anythin=\r\ng on the subject in english is so rare. During the historical\n&gt; developemen=\r\nt of Japan, it&#39;s amazing to see that the Katana took a \nbackseat\n&gt; to the B=\r\now and Naginata.\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; Mark\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; \n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt;=\r\n From: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n[mailto:nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com]O=\r\nn\n&gt; Behalf Of Andres Pedraza\n&gt; Sent: Thursday, December 07, 2006 8:43 PM\n&gt; =\r\nTo: nihonto@yahoogroups.com; nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: [nihon=\r\ntostudy] Yari and Naginata\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Nihonto People,\n&gt; \n&gt; I haven&#39;t seen a=\r\n whole lot of books on Yari and/or Naginata in\n&gt; English, so even though it=\r\n was a bit pricy, I purchased Roald and\n&gt; Susan Knutsen&#39;s book ( HYPERLINK\n=\r\n&gt; &quot;http://tinyurl.com/yxlhuj&quot;http://tinyurl.-com/yxlhuj). I just \nfinished =\r\nit.\n&gt; I am very impressed and sorry I did not purchase it earlier. The\n&gt; co=\r\nncise yet informative text plus the wealth of drawings and plates\n&gt; was wel=\r\nl worth the price.\n&gt; \n&gt; If there&#39;s anyone else out there interested in the =\r\nsubject and that\n&gt; has been on the fence about this great book because of t=\r\nhe price \ntag,\n&gt; well, stop considering it and buy it. Give it to yourself =\r\nfor\n&gt; Christmas. You won&#39;t regret it.\n&gt; \n&gt; And if Roald and Susan subscribe=\r\n to these lists (or someone who \nknows\n&gt; them does) please receive a big th=\r\nank you from me... This book will\n&gt; be a permanent part of my reference lib=\r\nrary.\n&gt; \n&gt; Anyone have any other books on Yari and/or Naginata they want to=\r\n\n&gt; recommend? I&#39;m thirsty for more knowledge now.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks!\n&gt; \n&gt; Andres\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; --\n&gt; No virus found in this incoming message.\n&gt; Checked by AVG Free Edi=\r\ntion.\n&gt; Version: 7.1.409 / Virus Database: 268.15.14/578 - Release Date: \n1=\r\n2/7/2006\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --\n&gt; No virus found in this outgoing message.\n&gt; Checked=\r\n by AVG Free Edition.\n&gt; Version: 7.1.409 / Virus Database: 268.15.15/579 - =\r\nRelease Date: \n12/7/2006\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have=\r\n been removed]\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"
