I bought it as such.\nSize is 70mm x 75mm x 5mm thick. About 3.5 thick at\nseppa dai.\n\nSure feels Higo in the hand and working with the iron.\nDarker than evident in this Florida sun drenched\nphoto. Nagged me that it had something relaxed about\nit like an Umetada piece, but didn&#39;t think it typical\nof them.\n\nAs I said, my original thoughts were kyo-shoami. I\nbought this one off photos, and it proved to be more\nthan I anticipated. So much going on in the mimi.\n\nToo many confusing characteristics. From the photos I\ntotally understand a &#39;shoami&#39; call. In hand, I don&#39;t\nknow. Doesn&#39;t feel shoami. Thought someone might name\na semi-obscure sidechool that might be a better fit.\n\nCurran\n\n\n--- Richard Turner &lt;ikkanshi@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; Early/mid edo shoami is my guess.

The tsuba is nice iron,\n&gt; with\n&gt; &gt; a good bit more magnetite to its patina than\n&gt; evident\n&gt; &gt; in the photo (and evident to me the first time I\n&gt; &gt; picked it up in its previous rusty condition).\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Note: The tsuba is concave on one side, much less\n&gt; so\n&gt; &gt; on the other side. So it is 1 to 2 mm thinner at\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; seppa dai than along the mimi.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Opinions as to school?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Thank you,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Curran\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; __________________________________________________\n&gt; &gt; Do You Yahoo!?\n&gt; &gt; Tired of spam?
