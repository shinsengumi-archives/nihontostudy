Indeed, a cast kagami is one of  the Three Sacr=\r\ned \nRegalia of Japan.  Kagami-shi tsuba, supposedly made in the pre-Edo \npe=\r\nriod by mirror makers, may also be of extremely high quality and it \nis not=\r\n illogical to suppose that many soft-metal tsuba may have \ninitially been c=\r\nast.\n\nBut the casting of iron tsuba is, for some reason, very frowned upon =\r\nby \ncollectors.  I am personally convinced that the vast majority of Namban=\r\n \ntsuba are cast and the poor quality of many of these makes this very \neas=\r\ny to detect with the use, simply, of a bright light and x30 \nmagnification.=\r\n  The ease with which casting can be identified clearly \ndepends upon the a=\r\nmount of hand finishing which was utilised afterwards.\n\nMany people will ju=\r\nstify the casting of Manban tsuba as being expected \nbecause of their poor =\r\nquality, but I believe that casting may have been \nused far more generally =\r\nthan is accepted.  It should be a simple matter \nto confirm this, but such =\r\nexaminations would need to be carried out on \ntsuba of accepted high qualit=\r\ny in order to avoid the a priori excuse \nof &#39;poor quality&#39;.\n\nWhite cast iro=\r\nn is not a suitable metal for casting, but the \ncarburisation of grey cast =\r\niron to produce  a malleable cast iron, \nwhich is ideal for casting small a=\r\nrtefacts such as tsuba, is a process \nthat has been known in Japan for seve=\r\nral hundred years.\n\nAs to whether the tsuba illustrated in your photo album=\r\n is cast or not, \nI would hesitate to offer a firm opinion without a hands-=\r\non \nexamination.  But my first impression is the absence of any clean, \nsha=\r\nrp chisel-work - I have my suspicions!\n\nRegards, John L.\n\n\n--- In nihontost=\r\nudy@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Elliott&quot; &lt;elliott@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; My question today i=\r\ns......... Did Tsuba makers in the Edo period \n&gt; ever &#39;cast&#39; their work?\n&gt; =\r\nI have a Tsuba that appears to have &#39;cast&#39; marks. I was told that it \n&gt; was=\r\n made in Edo period, the mei is Masahisa, the design of clouds was \n&gt; carve=\r\nd or engraved, and in oval shape. I was told it was &#39;authentic&#39;. \nI \n&gt; have=\r\n also been told that this tsuba is a cast reproduction. \n&gt; I am prepared fo=\r\nr any answer I receive.
