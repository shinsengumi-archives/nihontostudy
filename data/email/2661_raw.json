How confident are you about it being a late Muromachi tsuba?\nHave you or someone else seen this type of tsuba before, maybe in books\nas for reference?\nThe thing is that I have a very similar tsuba, almost identical, and i\nwould like to have as much information about it as possible. Do you\nthink it may be from the same era as yours or would mine be a later copy?\nThe measurements on my tsuba are almost the same as yours, mine is\nslightly thicker.\n8.0 cm H x 8.0 cm W x 0.4 cm T\n\nPlease take a look at it on\nhttp://hem.bredband.net/odrike/Tsuba1.htm\n\nRegards\nFredrik\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYahoo!
