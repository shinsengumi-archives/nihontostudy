The second had several signitures along with \nthe fi=\r\nrst&#39;s.  Torigoye made reference to Akiyama&#39;s descriptions but \nI&#39;ve never b=\r\neen able to find anything in English showing the \ndifferent mei and identif=\r\nying the differences in detail.  I have the \nNakamura Kakudaifu with Torigo=\r\nye&#39;s (Haynes) notations but it is \ndifficult to tell from oshigata.

Jim or someone\n&gt; else will comment best on this, but I wa=\r\ns reading\n&gt; through Haynes Catalogs last night and did come upon\n&gt; across a=\r\n section comparing 3 examples of &#39;Nobuiye\n&gt; longmei&#39;. Basically looks like =\r\nhis ana spacing left\n&gt; him too narrow a space for his normal signature and =\r\nhe\n&gt; consequently squeezed out his signature with one\n&gt; character at the to=\r\np and bottom V of area between the\n&gt; two openings.\n&gt;    I don&#39;t know how mu=\r\nch of a variation this was\n&gt; considered.\n&gt; \n&gt; Curran\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- klepet3331=\r\n9 &lt;Ppeterdds@a...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Would anyone know of a source for\n&gt; &gt; expl=\r\naination/differentiation of the \n&gt; &gt; different mei for Nobuiye?
