I started practicing kenjutsu and iaido with \ngreat effort and i love it, Well i&#39;m want to buy my first katana, \nand i know you already got many of this questions but here is it. \n\nI&#39;m looking for a cheap but useful katana to start with, i have not \nmuch budget so i&#39;m trying to look something around $100 more or less\n(i can try to afford more). I find this katanas but because i&#39;m \nnewbie i don&#39;t know which one are good. \n\nhttp://shopthroughtheages.com/unitedcutleryswords.html \nhttp://shopthroughtheages.com/paulchenswords.html \nhttp://shopthroughtheages.com/inhouseswords.html \n\nI don&#39;t know how the quality is or if they work for what i do. \n\nRight now my choice is the Paul Chen&#39;s Practical katana at $149 \nOr the leather katana from united cutlery.. (also what do you think \nabout the full tang?) cheaper but if it works it&#39;s ok for me. I want \nto start with something that feels real, i practice a lot with the \nbokken but you all know its weight is lots less than a real katana. \nIf there&#39;s any other type, brand or store that you can recommend i \nwill really appreciate it. \n\nThanks for your time. \n\n\n*That samurai 3000 katana looks so cheesy don&#39;t you think? lol.\n\n\n"
