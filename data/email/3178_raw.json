I had given up on the thread attracting any\nreply. Is there any way to estimate a period on menuki like this, or\nare they usually just lumped into the &quot;late edo&quot; period?\nI haven&#39;t seen a lot of info on menuki anywhere. Are there any\n(English) books with a decent chapter on menuki at all, and what are\nthe things to look out for in early menuki?\n\nRegards,\nBrian\n\n--- In nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Jim Gilbert&quot; &lt;jggilbert@E...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Brian,\n&gt; They&#39;re not Goto, although they are following the style.  I don&#39;t\nthink that it is possible to attribute them to a specific group.  At\nshinsa work like this is often described as Kyo-Kanagushi (Kyoto metal\nfittings maker). \n&gt; \n&gt; Jim\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   Hi all,\n&gt;   I recently made an offer on a set of menuki on eBay, and got them. I&#39;m\n&gt;   not a fittings guy at all, but wanted a nice pair for a future\n&gt;   mounting project, and as an example for study.\n&gt;   They were described as Goto or at least waki-goto. I doubt they are \n&gt;   Goto...but am wondering if anyone has any thoughts on the quality,\n&gt;   school etc? Are there any identifying marks on menuki that might lead\n&gt;   towards a certain school?\n&gt;   Was really attracted to them because of the fine carving work, and\n&gt;   detail. The colour is a nice dark brownish-black shakudo, not like the\n&gt;   lighting in the photo shows.\n&gt;   They are actually nicer than in the pics..with some very fine carving,\n&gt;   and detail on the toes, ribs, tail etc. Some odd marks on the\n&gt;   legs..which are 2 ovals with a small dot in the middle.\n&gt;   Middle to late edo I assume? Condition is very good. Any comments from\n&gt;   &quot;menuki guys&quot; appreciated.\n&gt; \n&gt;   Pic is at\n&gt;   http://www.image-hosting.net/images/messageboard/retalt/Menuki.jpg\n&gt; \n&gt;   Thanks,\n&gt;   Brian \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n"
