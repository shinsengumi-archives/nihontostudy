Sukashi refers to pierced tsuba. \n\nThere are certainly no rules as to what designs are best to collect.  If you lack opinions, you should collect books.  I recommend starting with Sasano and Torigoye&#39;s books.  You might want to own the Sukashi and Akasaka tusba Sano Museum catalogues as well.  And it&#39;s nice to have the Haynes catalogues.  Even just those books will represent a substantial investment, so think twice, before proceeding. \n\nThe only Nihonto material certain to hold its value and be easily resellable is very expensive top quality stuff.  Top quality tsuba are not necessarily easily identified or defined, but pieces of the sort sell at auction at Christie&#39;s and Sotheby&#39;s for thousands of dollars.  Not uncommonly for more than $5000.    \n\nDavid Zincavage\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: Anthony H \n  To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Wednesday, December 21, 2005 10:50 PM\n  Subject: Re: [nihontostudy] Where do you buy your Tsuba?\n\n\n  Ken,\n     \n    Good info. Not sure whether to take it that this Kurt guy is a fraud or he has two inch thick glasses and can&#39;t tell the bugs apart.\n     \n    Might be a simple question, but what is kinko or sukashi? \n     \n    From reading what you said, is the Mantis design highly sought after or maybe you can tell what are the best designs are to collect? I&#39;m sure a lot is personal tastes, but the question is more for what will hold value and easily be resold.\n     \n    Thanks,\n    Anthony\n\n  Kenneth Wilson &lt;kdw21620@...&gt; wrote:\n    Anthony,\n\n  I also have purchased from Rich&#39;s sources (he is a\n  sukashi tsuba slut by the way).  In addition I have\n  purchased from Ron.  I would purchase from all of them\n  again.  Many tsuba are not papered, it is not worth\n  the cost of many to put them through shinsa.  Since it\n  is much harder to attribute to a particular smith, you\n  will also be likely to get a paper to a general school\n  (for the unsigned ones).  There are all price points.\n\n  The only one I have not purchased from is that Kurt\n  Holtz dude.  The major reason is that he tries to pass\n  off crickets as preying mantises.  As if I don&#39;t know\n  the difference.  Gets me all excited in searching ebay\n  and have a hit other than the Chen crappers and it\n  turns out to be a waste.  Even mentions me by name,\n  like he couldn&#39;t just email me. \n\n  Be careful buying books, especially those japanese\n  ones.  They are addicting in their own right and then\n  you end up with all these books you can&#39;t read.  Of\n  course, if you can read them, I will tell you which\n  ones to buy and you can translate them for me.  \n\n  Remember tsuba are 2 sided, if one sided don&#39;t buy or\n  if already purchased certainly don&#39;t email list that\n  you baught a 1 sided tsuba (I love to bring this\n  incident up makes me still laugh- happened to a list\n  member a few years ago).  Milt can give you a\n  dissertation on how to buy on ebay.  Tom Helm can also\n  tell you why those tsuba&#39;s recommended by Milt suck. \n  Actually I have gotten a few off ebay over the years\n  and prices are usually good.  Just don&#39;t buy anything\n  from China, unless from a pilot living in Hong Kong\n  but he only cares about hizen (he gets touchy about\n  condemning all of china- basically don&#39;t buy from the\n  billion or so people minus one).\n\n  Ok, I put a lot of list history in this post and most\n  likely you have no idea of the stories behind them,\n  but I am reminiscing.  Buy some books and find some\n  collectors to handle tsuba.  Some like kinko some like\n  sukashi, some like both.\n\n  You can always ask questions here.   Just remember\n  that any preying mantis themed tsuba and/or sword\n  fittings must be cheaply sold to me.  Milt keeps on\n  trying to sell me stuff at full retail when I know he\n  got them cheap, plus I am originally from NY and we\n  don&#39;t pay retail!  He complains about son&#39;s tuition at\n  BU and I keep telling him, I went to Grad school there\n  and they aren&#39;t getting anymore of my money.  Have\n  fun!\n\n  all the best,\n  Ken aka &quot;the mantis dude&quot; a puveyor of all kamakiri\n  tosogou\n\n  --- Ron Hartmann &lt;swords@...&gt; wrote:\n\n  &gt; Anthony - \n  &gt; \n  &gt; Sorry to sound like such a &quot;merchant&quot; but if you&#39;re\n  &gt; interested I can send you some pictures of a very\n  &gt; nice selection of good quality iron tsuba that I&#39;m\n  &gt; selling. Most are $200 range, more or less. If you\n  &gt; are new at this I would be happy to recommend good\n  &gt; ones that would help teach you about these things.\n  &gt; Some of these have been to a number of shows and are\n  &gt; now kept home so that I can keep my table at the\n  &gt; shows, fresh. All are authentic, for sure. The shows\n  &gt; seem to have a wonderful selection of nice quality\n  &gt; tsuba these days and that is good for the buyer, bad\n  &gt; for the seller since there is such a &quot;selection&quot; to\n  &gt; pick from. Anyway...just thought I&#39;d toss this idea\n  &gt; out to you. I&#39;ve been around for going on 40\n  &gt; years...gosh, that&#39;s a little frightening to put in\n  &gt; writing! \n  &gt; \n  &gt; Ron\n  &gt; STL\n  &gt;   ----- Original Message ----- \n  &gt;   From: anwahi \n  &gt;   To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n  &gt;   Sent: Wednesday, December 21, 2005 4:23 PM\n  &gt;   Subject: [nihontostudy] Where do you buy your\n  &gt; Tsuba?\n  &gt; \n  &gt; \n  &gt;   Hello,\n  &gt; \n  &gt;   I&#39;m new here and to collecting Tsuba. Where do you\n  &gt; buy your Tsuba from? \n  &gt;   I know there&#39;s several websites you can find with\n  &gt; a Google search, an \n  &gt;   occasional Token Kai show like the one in SF, or\n  &gt; Ebay (most look like \n  &gt;   junk). I&#39;m looking for good sources of authentic\n  &gt; Tsuba. Obviously the \n  &gt;   only way to be really sure of authenticity is to\n  &gt; purchase papered \n  &gt;   Tsuba, but because I&#39;m starting off I want some\n  &gt; sources of authentic \n  &gt;   Tsuba more reasonably priced.
