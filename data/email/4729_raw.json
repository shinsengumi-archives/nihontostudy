It is accepted because\n&gt; it cannot be\n&gt; undone. No-one here would have an old sword\n&gt; shortened because they\n&gt; think it would look better that way. \n&gt; Adding hi may not be noticable, but it is not the\n&gt; chosen action by\n&gt; anyone except yourself..and since we are preserving\n&gt; these swords for\n&gt; future generations...I just feel it is selfish to\n&gt; change it. The next\n&gt; generation may want it shortened..the next will add\n&gt; a horimono..and\n&gt; after a few generations what was a nice Shinto sword\n&gt; becomes another\n&gt; back-of-the-cupboard relic. None of this can be\n&gt; undone, and the fact\n&gt; that others may do it does not make it the correct\n&gt; action.\n&gt; \n&gt; Just my 2c on behapf of future generations looking\n&gt; for original Nihonto.\n&gt; \n&gt; Brian\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com, Enore Gardonio\n&gt; &lt;egardon@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Its a Shinto blade not Koto. If I do put the hi on\n&gt; it will not be for \n&gt; &gt; whistling purposes. What makes people think that I\n&gt; would shallowly ruin \n&gt; &gt; an old blade. I see no reason why the blade cannot\n&gt; be used for Iaido\n&gt; and \n&gt; &gt; adding a hi on it does not ruin the blade, if done\n&gt; by a proper smith in \n&gt; &gt; Japan. The blade can still be appreciated. We are\n&gt; obviously looking at \n&gt; &gt; this from opposite ends. If done correctly and I\n&gt; presented you with the \n&gt; &gt; blade for the first time you would probably not\n&gt; know that it was\n&gt; modified.\n&gt; &gt; Enore\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n\n\n\n \n____________________________________________________________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nEveryone is raving about the all-new Yahoo!
