Fed Lohman has a gentleman \nwho does polishing but I do not know of anyo=\r\nne who has used him and I do not \nwant this blade ruined as I already saved=\r\n it for a horrible fate as a yard \nwork tool...\n\nThere is a lot of activity=\r\n (due to the water/brine quenching) along the \nHamon that I can still see a=\r\n bit though the very light surface oxidation.. I \ncould be wrong but I feel=\r\n that it could benefit from restoration, even as a \nsimple &quot;what the heck, =\r\nlet&#39;s do it&quot; type of project.\n\nI just don&#39;t want to be trying to make a sil=\r\nk purse out of a sow&#39;s ear if \nyou know what I mean...
