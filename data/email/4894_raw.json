About this time \nYasutsugu was given=\r\n the privilege of using the character &quot;Yasu&quot; from \nTokugawa Ieyasu&#39;s name. =\r\nThus he changed his name to Yasutsugu from \nthat point on. About the same t=\r\nime ( some feel it was a few years \nlater) he was given the additional priv=\r\nilege of carving the Hollyhock \ncrest ( Aoi mon) on his blades. These privi=\r\nleges were given in \nperpetuity to Yasutsugu and his descendents. Thus the =\r\nYasutsugu \nswordsmiths became the kaji of the Tokugawa Family.\n\nEarlier I r=\r\naised the question of what made Yasutsugu&#39;s fame and \nfortune seem to sprea=\r\nd disproportionately to his skill when we \ncompare him to some of his conte=\r\nmporary smiths such as Umetada Myoju \nand Horikawa Kunihiro. About this tim=\r\ne, non oriental foreigners made \ntheir presence felt in Japan for the first=\r\n time. Things from \nthe &quot;West&quot; were new, exciting, strange, and highly soug=\r\nht after. \nYasutsugu was one of the first advocates of using namban tetsu \n=\r\n(foreign steel) in his swords. He proudly incised this fact on the \nnakago =\r\nof his later works. It was new, it was exciting, and there is \nno doubt tha=\r\nt this use of foreign steel helped spread his fameis is \nfrom an article on=\r\n nihonto.com\n\n\n\n--- In nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Alan Bale&quot; &lt;abale@...=\r\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; To All,\n&gt; Yasutsugu 1st inscribed &#39;Nanban tetsu wo motte&#39; on s=\r\nome of his \nswords, according to the Meikan his dated blades range from 161=\r\n3 to \n1621\n&gt; Alan\n&gt; \n&gt;   ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt;   From: Gordon Rob=\r\nson \n&gt;   To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n&gt;   Sent: Thursday, February 22,=\r\n 2007 12:53 AM\n&gt;   Subject: RE: [nihontostudy] Re: NAMBAN TETSU\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   H=\r\ni all,\n&gt; \n&gt;   Although this is way out of my field, based on inscriptions t=\r\nhat \nclaim\n&gt;   namban-tetsu use, I would push its introduction way past the=\r\n late \n16th cent.\n&gt;   The swords with such inscriptions are by smiths worki=\r\nng in large \nresidential\n&gt;   areas like Edo and Osaka.

It is true, of course, that her \n&gt;   cannonballs were almost certainl=\r\ny of cast iron; I believe that by \n&gt;   the end of the C16 stone cannonballs=\r\n had been virtually \ncompletely \n&gt;   replaced by iron.

Bronze cannon =\r\nwere so much easier to \n&gt;   &gt; produce and less likely to fail than iron. Th=\r\ne only difference \nof \n&gt;   &gt; import at this time is bronze was more expensi=\r\nve to use. So, I \nwent \n&gt;   &gt; to a forum where there are some dedicated his=\r\ntorians. I paste \nthe \n&gt;   &gt; answers below.\n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; Anyway, thi=\r\ns might answer your question. The book &#39;The Dutch \n&gt;   &gt; Discovery Of Japan=\r\n&#39; by Dirk Jan Barreveld (which is full of \nerrors, \n&gt;   &gt; but still helpful=\r\n in gaining an understanding of Dutch trade) \n&gt;   states \n&gt;   &gt; that a repo=\r\nrt filed by a Jesuit sent to inspect the ship says \nthat \n&gt;   &gt; the ship ha=\r\nd &#39;19 pieces of guns made of bronze&#39; (other sources \ngive \n&gt;   &gt; the number=\r\n as 18 or 26). \n&gt;   &gt; From Turnbull&#39;s Osaka book-Ieyasu had 10 European can=\r\nnon at the \n&gt;   &gt; battles of Osaka in 1614-15. 5 were Dutch made &#39;Ishibaya&#39;=\r\n \ncannons \n&gt;   &gt; (which fired shot ranging from 12 lbs to 35-40 lbs-it&#39;s un=\r\nclear \n&gt;   which \n&gt;   &gt; type Ieyasu had, though). These were likely from th=\r\ne cannon \ntaken \n&gt;   &gt; from DeLiefde. The other 5 were bought from the Engl=\r\nish East \nIndia \n&gt;   &gt; Company and were invoiced by Richard Cocks on Decemb=\r\ner 5, 1614. \n&gt;   They \n&gt;   &gt; included 4 culverins (17.5 lbs) and one saker =\r\n(5.5 lbs). Out of \n&gt;   about \n&gt;   &gt; 300 artillery pieces Ieyasu fielded at =\r\nOsaka, these were the \nonly \n&gt;   &gt; heavy siege guns apart from one Japanese=\r\n gun. This was \n&gt;   &gt; the &#39;Shinbatsuji&#39; gun, which was made by Shibatsuji R=\r\nyuemon \n&gt;   Sukenobu. \n&gt;   &gt; It was about 11 feet long with a 90 mm bore, a=\r\nnd fired shot \nabout \n&gt;   the \n&gt;   &gt; same size as small Dutch cannon. Unfor=\r\ntunately, it&#39;s not noted \nwhat \n&gt;   &gt; they&#39;re made of-the picture of the Ja=\r\npanese gun (which is at \n&gt;   &gt; Yasukuni) looks like it was bronze. My Japan=\r\nese books would \nlikely \n&gt;   &gt; have this info, but they&#39;re not here .\n&gt;   &gt;=\r\n \n&gt;   &gt; AND\n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; Samurai William, p.91, states that the Liefde&#39;s ca=\r\nnnon were \nbronze\n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; I still await more information on possible e=\r\narly sources for \n&gt;   &gt; nambantetsu. I will let you know. It seems so far t=\r\nhat article \nhas \n&gt;   a \n&gt;   &gt; lot of supposition.
