I set up the list to not allow attachments.  I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s\npossible to post non-photo files on the group website.  With a small group,\nmailing out the spreadsheet individually isn&#39;t a problem.\n\nI&#39;m the owner/moderator, although I&#39;m not running the list in &quot;moderated\nmode&quot; where I would actually approve posts.  I&#39;m hoping that we can enjoy an\nopen discussion of swords and fittings here without going crazy.\n\nSeveral people have had comments or questions about membership.  When I sent\nout the email about the list last night, I scrolled through my address book\nfor the people who I thought might be interested.  If anyone has friends\nthat are serious about the subject and can play well with others, please\ninvite them to join.  I don&#39;t want to make this a closed list, but I&#39;d\nrather not go out and advertise just yet so please hold off with the web\nlinks for now.\n\nI&#39;d like to hear any thoughts about how to maintain a successful list --\njust  be sure to respond off line to me at jggilbert@... rather\nthan to the whole list.\nJim\n\n\n&gt; Why not just post the excell spreadsheet to the list\n&gt; so members can get it from there and you don&#39;t have to\n&gt; keep emailing it to everyone. Just a suggestion..\n&gt;\n&gt; Bob R\n&gt;\n&gt; BTW Who&#39;s the moderator for this list? And would said\n&gt; moderator mind if I posted the link to my website in\n&gt; the links section? Thought I&#39;d ask first.\n&gt;\n\n\n"
