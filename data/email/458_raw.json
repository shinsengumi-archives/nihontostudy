I don&#39;t think that it is so old or worn down.  It is done in Nara style, but is probably later shiiremono given the quality of the plate and inlay.  I don&#39;t see oni horns on the front... they look more like the tops of pagoda done in Kaneie-style landscape.  The &quot;blossoms&quot; are probably just the usual depiction of pine needle whorls.  But, you have the plate in hand and photos are difficult to work with.\n\nJim\n\n\n  http://zincavage.org/OniandSnail.html\n\n\n  I just bought a tsuba which is quite old and much worn down.  On the first\n  side, it has an oni sitting happily beneath a flowering tree by the light of\n  a full moon, while below him a snail crawls by. Moon, blossoms, and the\n  oni&#39;s horns are gold.  On the reverse, the oni is disappearing away from us,\n  as the snail crosses the bottom in his direction.\n\n  Are tsubas this worn considered to be severely diminished in value?\n\n  Is anyone acquainted with a Japanese oni-and-snail story?\n\n\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
