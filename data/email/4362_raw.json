It is longer \nthan most WWII blades (ha is 26.75&quot;).  It also has a Showa cherry \nblossom stamp.  The polisher said it was a folded blade (19 folds), \nconfirmed by CAT scan, and was one of the hardest blades to polish he \nhad come across.  Lacking the Showa stamp, they believed its \ncraftsmanship indicated a pre 1860s blade\n\nIts matching saya is also unusual--it is covered in a tan-colored same \nwhich is 3 skins expertly applied, but the gunto mount looks hacked in \nas if retrofitted later.\n\nSo, absent the Showa stamp, both blade and saya suggest an ancestoral \nblade that was stamped and refitted as gunto for use in WWII.  What else \nmight I look for to authenticate it?\n\nnihontochicken wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Yes, many ancestral blades were remounted in gunto koshirae and\n&gt; carried off to the Pacific War. But they were not stamped with the\n&gt; Showa cherry blossom. A Showa stamp, also the nearly as common Seki\n&gt; stamp, indicates the blade is not completely traditionally made. In\n&gt; some better examples that look very traditional, displaying both hada\n&gt; and water tempered hamon, the stamp indicates it was made with western\n&gt; style steel instead of the traditional tamahagane.\n&gt;\n&gt; NC\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n&gt; &lt;mailto:nihontostudy%40yahoogroups.com&gt;, &quot;mark sala&quot; \n&gt; &lt;franzkafka19@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Yes this is true. Old mounts removed and new military mounts as\n&gt; replacements. Reason for this is to make the sword SHOWA. I have\n&gt; several, well more than several.
