This was the sword I had mentioned several weeks ago regarding the mei being &quot;gold filled&quot; which seemed odd for a shinshinto sword. Yesterday, I finally saw some good photos of the blade and must admit that the mei looked darn good. I was not bidding, but a local friend did stick with it up to around $6,500 thereabout. (Darn auction house fee and state taxes really add up!) Curious if anyone knows who might had won the sword? \n\nInteresting. Looking in Toko Taikan I see that Nobuhide is &quot;valued&quot; over 11% higher than Naotane (and Tsuda Sukenao, another example checked). This surprised me that he (jojo saku) would be valued higher than Naotane (saijo saku) or Sukenao (jojo saku). Thoughts on this, anyone?\n\nMei was niji mei which bothered me (missing &quot;Taira&quot; in it) but I found out today that Nobuhide did apparently sign niji mei. Oh well, if &quot;right&quot; then somebody got a good deal at that price!! \n\nRon\nSTL\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
