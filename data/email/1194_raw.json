If any of you could point me in the right\ndirection, I&#39;d be most grateful.\n\nThanks,\n\nBuddy Ethridge\nExhibitions Coordinator\nLSU Libraries\n\nBuddy,\nNo one has picked up the loose end you dangled in front of us, perhaps for\nvery good reason. I will do so, but only very carefully.  Before responding\nto a part of the specific question you have put before the list, let me\nmake two general points.\nFirst, I really like the idea of cross-cultural trends in martial arts - by\nwhich I assume you mean the embellishment of weapons and associated\nmaterial objects as opposed to the behaviors of fighting.  This strikes me\nas terribly interesting. I have always wondered about the distribution of\nwritten messages on blades, for example. The worldwide occurrence of swords\nwith side blades, is another thing that somebody really ought to describe.\nYou are operating in a very interesting - and even significant - area.\nSecond, I think you will find that the wonder of Japanese swords is in the\ndetails. You will have to be very careful about how you use and treat\nJapanese data, or the grey beards of nippon-to will be very grumpy.\n\nNow on to your question.\n\nOver the past couple of years, I have gotten quite interested in tsuba that\nseem - to me - to show direct influence between Japanese and foreign\nswords. In generic terms these are assigned to the &quot;Namban&quot; style. Within\nthat categories there are masses of clearly Japanese stuff. Then there are\nsome guards that seem to have obvious referents to European rapiers or\nsmallsword guards. And then there are  guards that have been adapted for\nuse with Japanese blades altho they also seem to be of Chinese manufactures\nThese come in two type - at least. First there are some cupped tsuba that\nseem to have been made in China and used in Japan. The other type is more\nclassically &quot;Namban&quot; but with no sign of accommodation to nippon-to. And\nthey show up in placed like Tibet and Nepal.\nTo my eye, these tsuba show diverse international influence that is not\nsurprising, given the way East Asia worked in the 16th and 17th century.\nJohn Lissenden wrote a very interesting MA thesis on this school at the\nUniversity of Durham, last year. I am sure that he will try to see it\npublished, but that has not happened yet. Beyond that there is a lot of\nother discussion of these issues whenever the Namban category is described.\n\nBest of luck\nP. Bleed\n\n\n\n\n"
