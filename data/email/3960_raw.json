The global privilege settings have not changed, so you&#39;re supposed to be able to post photos.  Here&#39;s something to try -- create a new album and try to put your photos in there.  I&#39;m guessing that the problem may be happening when you try to update an old folder that has been converted to the new format.\n\nI haven&#39;t had a problem putting photos in newly created albums, but haven&#39;t tried uploading anything to an old one.  Rich also has moderator privileges on this list, so he should be able to do whatever I can, other than delete the whole thing.\nJim \n\n\n\n\n  Jim,\n  I tried to upload a few pics of  tekkotsu to my album, at the very last \n  minutes I got the &quot; error message&quot;..........something about I don&#39;t \n  have the previlege to add to the album .\n  I don&#39;t feel like I have  &quot; sox in my mouth &quot;, what gives ?\n\n  milt\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
