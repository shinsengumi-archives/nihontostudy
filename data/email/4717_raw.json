It was done often with conversion of tachi to \nuchigatana or=\r\n katana, to balance the sword. Hearing about the koto \nbeing carved makes m=\r\ne shudder. To carve bohi for better whistling \nsounds is a shallow reason t=\r\no alter something that can not be undone. \nYou will never use this sword fo=\r\nr what it was intended (battle) so \nuse an iaito with any horimono you wish=\r\n to make whistles and leave \nhistorical irreplaceable objects alone. John\n\n=\r\n\n\n--- In nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com, Enore Gardonio &lt;egardon@...&gt; \nwrote:=\r\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Thank you Peter. I will certainly keep the advice in mind. Don&#39;t \nforg=\r\net \n&gt; though, a sword is made for a reason and I don&#39;t believe its for \n&gt; a=\r\nppreciation of its beauty. First and foremost it was made to be \nused. I \n&gt;=\r\n see nothing wrong with practicing with it. I intend to take very \ngood \n&gt; =\r\ncare of it.......... I consider myself  very lucky to own such a \npiece.\n&gt; =\r\nEnore\n&gt; \n&gt; Peter A Bleed wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Enore,\n&gt; &gt; I want to second Gordon&#39;s ad=\r\nvice. I would urge you not to alter \nyour  sword\n&gt; &gt; in the way you are des=\r\ncribing. If you want a grooved blade order \none or\n&gt; &gt; find one. At the ver=\r\ny least you should not do anything until you \nhave had\n&gt; &gt; your blade well =\r\nshinsa&#39;d.\n&gt; &gt; Still, your question does point up a basic feature of the wor=\r\nld of\n&gt; &gt; nippon-to. The values and standards of the various people \ninvolv=\r\ned in\n&gt; &gt; Japanese swords are diverse. What is absolutely &quot;wrong&quot; to some \n=\r\nis &quot;just\n&gt; &gt; fine&quot; to others. Most of us base our actions on our views of \n=\r\naesthetics and\n&gt; &gt; a sense of historical preservation. There are other valu=\r\nes out \nthere and\n&gt; &gt; knowing that helps to understand some of the things w=\r\ne see about \nswords.\n&gt; &gt; When I was first in Japan I happened to meet a num=\r\nber of sword \ncraftsmen\n&gt; &gt; rather than collectors. Of course this was inte=\r\nresting (heck, it \nwas\n&gt; &gt; wonderful), but it may have given me a skewed vi=\r\new.\n&gt; &gt; 1. The first &quot;smith&quot; I met ( and he was an important artist-and a\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; wonderful person) was re-tempering some old swords when I visited \nhis\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; forge.\n&gt; &gt; 2.  An important kinko proudly showed me his portfolio that \n=\r\nincluded some\n&gt; &gt; very excellent &quot;umegane&quot; work he had done. He assured me =\r\nthat &quot;no \none could\n&gt; &gt; see&quot; the fillings he had put into some seriously fl=\r\nawed blades.\n&gt; &gt; 3. During a road trip with a fellow who had recently compl=\r\neted his\n&gt; &gt; polishing apprenticeship, we took a long extra trip to let his=\r\n \nteacher see\n&gt; &gt; the grooves he was carving on a tanto. He was proud of hi=\r\ns work \nand his\n&gt; &gt; master approved. When I asked why he was doing it, he s=\r\naid &quot;the \nsmith\n&gt; &gt; should have put the grooves in.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; These men are not =\r\ncrooks or villains. Indeed, I think they are \ngreat\n&gt; &gt; artists and skilled=\r\n students, but they operate with a different \nset of\n&gt; &gt; values.\n&gt; &gt; You ce=\r\nrtainly can find craftsmen who will do what you ask of \nthem, but one\n&gt; &gt; t=\r\nhing is clear. You will only be able to cut grooves in your \nsword once. I\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; urge you to proceed with caution.\n&gt; &gt; Peter\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Peter Bleed\n&gt; &gt; Pro=\r\nfessor of Anthropology\n&gt; &gt; 810 Oldfather Hall\n&gt; &gt; University of Nebraska\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; Lincoln, NE 68588-0368\n&gt; &gt; (402) 472-2439\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;                   =\r\n                                                  \n       \n&gt; &gt;             =\r\n &quot;Gordon \nRobson&quot;                                               \n&gt; &gt;       =\r\n       \n&lt;robsongo@...                                             \n&gt; &gt;     =\r\n         \njp&gt;                                                        To \n&gt; =\r\n&gt;              Sent by:                  \n&lt;nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com&gt;   =\r\n   \n&gt; &gt;              \nnihontostudy@yaho                                    =\r\n      cc \n&gt; &gt;              \nogroups.com                                    =\r\n               \n&gt; \n&gt;                                                       =\r\n             \nSubject \n&gt; &gt;                                        RE: [niho=\r\nntostudy] Bo-\nhi            \n&gt; &gt;              12/05/2006 \n05:16            =\r\n                                  \n&gt; &gt;              \nPM                    =\r\n                                        \n&gt; \n&gt;                              =\r\n                                       \n       \n&gt; \n&gt;                       =\r\n                                              \n       \n&gt; &gt;              Ple=\r\nase respond \nto                                             \n&gt; &gt;           =\r\n   \nnihontostudy@yaho                                             \n&gt; &gt;     =\r\n            \nogroups.com                                                \n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt;                                                                     \n   =\r\n    \n&gt; \n&gt;                                                                  =\r\n   \n       \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hi Enore,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Are you talking about tak=\r\ning an antique sword and cutting a \ngroove in it?
