I did my best to post \nof =\r\npic of it in the FILE section.  If you can&#39;t find it, please let \nme know. =\r\n It is katana size tsuba (8 cm high by 7.9 cm wide and .4 \ncm thick). I am =\r\nfairly certain that it is from the early Edo period \nbut I am not an expert=\r\n so I can&#39;t guarantee that dating. I leave it \nto the buyer to make their o=\r\nwn determination on its exact age but I \nam quite sure that it is no later =\r\nthan Mid Edo period. \nThe theme is of a chrysanthemum and the sukashi workm=\r\nanship is \nexcellent. The color is a deep, dark brown and black. The patina=\r\n is \nrich, glossy and smooth. The marks on the seppa dai are intentional \na=\r\nnd are a &quot;signature&quot; of sorts left by the smith who made it. The \nonly dama=\r\nge is some light pitting to the rim. There are a few rust \nspots on the rim=\r\n that could be improved with boning but overall \nthere is nothing to do but=\r\n enjoy this tsuba! It comes in a fancy \nJapanese wooden box that is lined w=\r\nith brocade fabric. I am sure you \nwill be happy with it. \nEmail me at kirk=\r\n-becky@... for more info and pics. \nPRICE $895 \n\nI also have listed a k=\r\nozuka, FK and set of menuki on EBAy- all are \nsigned and very nice. \nSee th=\r\ne links below to view or search under my handle revkirk. I \nwill consider s=\r\nellling them offline to list members. \n\nhttp://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dl=\r\nlViewItem&ih=3D018&item=3D280033191663\n&rd=3D1&sspagename=3DSTRK%3AMESE%3AI=\r\nT&rd=3D1\n\nhttp://cgi.ebay.com/Fine-Menuki-Signed-Goto-Etsujo-for \nTanto_W0Q=\r\nQitemZ280033193052QQihZ018QQcategoryZ73466QQssPageNameZWDVWQ\nQrdZ1QQcmdZVie=\r\nwItem\n\nhttp://cgi.ebay.com/Extraordinary-Japanese-Sword-Kozuka-Signed-Goto-=\r\n\nHojo_W0QQitemZ280033194077QQihZ018QQcategoryZ73466QQssPageNameZWDVWQQ\nrdZ1=\r\nQQcmdZViewItem\n\nI also have a years worth of NTHK journals Token To Rekishi=\r\n (all in \nJapanese) from the non-Yoshikawa group.
