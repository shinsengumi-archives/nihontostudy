I could have sworn it was only\nfriday!\nYou&#39;re telling me you know of contacts in Canada for study and collection?\nWell Merry Christmas to me!  LOL\nI live in New Brunswick on the east coast. Occasionally I&#39;ll make it out\nwest to do some mountain climbing and I&#39;ve been down to New Hampshire, Mount\nWashington. Apart from that, I usually don&#39;t get state side. I can just see\nmyself trying to explain to a customs officer that I&#39;m travelling to the\nU.S. to attend a Japanese Sword Show! LOL! I&#39;m going to need a passport next\nyear just to cross the border into Maine so I can buy cheap milk!\nWhere abouts  are you located John?\nAny information you can provide me with would be greatly appreciated. If\nanyone out there in Nihonto land wants to come to New Brunswick and share\ntheir knowledge, I will supply Beer and Lobsters.\nNow if there&#39;s going to be more than 10 of you or any international\narrivals, (Andres), I will need some time to plan.\nHave a great holiday season everyone. It&#39;s been great listening to your\nbanter.\n\nMark\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com\n[mailto:nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com]On Behalf Of John Berta\nSent: Thursday, December 22, 2005 5:53 PM\nTo: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: Re: [nihontostudy] Where do you buy your Tsuba?\n\n\nHi Mark;\n\nWhere in Canada are you.

Most are $200 range, more or less. If you are new at this I\nwould be happy to recommend good ones that would help teach you about these\nthings. Some of these have been to a number of shows and are now kept home\nso that I can keep my table at the shows, fresh. All are authentic, for\nsure. The shows seem to have a wonderful selection of nice quality tsuba\nthese days and that is good for the buyer, bad for the seller since there is\nsuch a &quot;selection&quot; to pick from. Anyway...just thought I&#39;d toss this idea\nout to you. I&#39;ve been around for going on 40 years...gosh, that&#39;s a little\nfrightening to put in writing!\n\nRon\nSTL\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: anwahi\nTo: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com\nSent: Wednesday, December 21, 2005 4:23 PM\nSubject: [nihontostudy] Where do you buy your Tsuba?\n\n\nHello,\n\nI&#39;m new here and to collecting Tsuba. Where do you buy your Tsuba from?\nI know there&#39;s several websites you can find with a Google search, an\noccasional Token Kai show like the one in SF, or Ebay (most look like\njunk). I&#39;m looking for good sources of authentic Tsuba. Obviously the\nonly way to be really sure of authenticity is to purchase papered\nTsuba, but because I&#39;m starting off I want some sources of authentic\nTsuba more reasonably priced. Any suggestions?\n\nThanks for your helpo in advance,\nAnthony\n\n\n\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n--\nYAHOO! GROUPS LINKS\n\na..
