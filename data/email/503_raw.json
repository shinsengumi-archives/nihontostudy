They were very useful. Doesn&#39;t\n  anyone happen to know when umegane were developed. I assume that they\nwould\n  be an expensive fix these days, but in the days of cheap labor, like say\n  the Edo period,  might they have been a cheap fix?\n\n  Peter Bleed\n  Associate Dean\n  College of Arts and Sciences\n  1223 Oldfather Hall\n  University of Nebraska\n  Lincoln, NE 68588-0312\n  (402) 472-2891\n\n\n  Hi Peter,\n\n  I don&#39;t know if this has been answered yet, but, in general umegane are\n  always bad, particularly if they are easy to spot. In a blade like this\n  Fujishima where open, flowing grain in the shinogi-ji is to be expected,\n  doing an umegane is just silly. The same is true with a very fine omi-yari\n  I\n  own that is hugh. It also has a series of rectangular umegane that have\n  mostly fallen out. The blade is Kanabo and one should expect powerful\n  running masame that opens up in places in such a work. There is no reason\n  to\n  do umegane and now that they are visible and have fallen out, it detracts\na\n  great deal from the blade. On the other had, I have a rather nice katana\n  where the umegane had fallen out. I had it replaced. You can&#39;t see it and\n  it\n  looks better now as opposed to the open hole in the skin. So, a case by\n  case\n  answer. Just my 25 cents worth.\n\n  Gordon\n    -----Original Message-----\n    From: Peter A Bleed [mailto:pbleed1@...]\n    Sent: Friday, July 04, 2003 12:09 AM\n    To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com\n    Subject: [nihontostudy] umegane-good or bad?\n\n\n\n    Listeros!\n          Allow me to once again present the limits of knowledge with a\n    question that others may find either 1) of interest or  2) answerable.\n          Yesterday I looked at a &quot;sword&quot; brought home from the Philippines\n  and\n    owned (proudly) by the nephew of the man who sent it home in 1944. Since\n    this could be anything and not likely for sale, I think we will all\nagree\n    that the chances of this being of any interest were pretty slim.\n  Surprise,\n    it turned out to b a relatively clean wakizashi in a nice old\nshira-saya.\n    The blade was signed Fujishima Tomoshige, I assume one of the late\n    koto/very early Shinto Kaga smiths of that line - tight itame with a\n    komidare. A sword.\n          Perhaps the most interesting thing about the sword was a\n  rectangular\n    umegane set into the shinogi-ji in the monouchi. It measured maybe 1/4&quot;\n  by\n    1/2&quot; and was clearly visible. It had not fully removed the flaw since\n  there\n    was a clear fukure on its edge.\n          My question to the List is whether on not this kind of umegane is\n    good or bad. Well, it can hardly be &quot;good,&quot; right? There was a flaw\n  there,\n    but an umegane must be better than a flaw, right? Does an umegane\ndetract\n    from or enhance the value of a sword?  And how visible should an umegane\n    be?  Is the fact that this plug was clearly visible - and square! - mean\n    that it was poorly done?\n          Peter Bleed\n\n\n\n\n          Yahoo!
