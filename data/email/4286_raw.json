It is a beautiful Mino\nShakudo Tsuba.  I believe the kogai ana is filled with\ncopper.  It has nice nanako.  The edge is completely\nfilled with leaves and flowers,etc.  The only really\nweird thing is that the seppa-dai must have be put on\na pole weapon or something.  It has notches put in and\nthe nakaga ana has been widened.  Questions, where\nwould you classify this?  I was thinking mid-edo,  but\nwhat would you look for in ko-mino work?   I have been\nlooking for a piece like this for a long time and I\nthink I did well on the purchase.  Comments please\n(good and bad). \n\nhttp://w25.photobucket.com/widgets/dynamicflash.php?featuretype=bucketstrip&featurename=Minotsuba&pa=/c52/kamakiri/Mino/\nDouble click on scrolling picture to view more\ndetailed photo.  Just playing with internet tools.\n\nThanks.\nKen\n\n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?  Yahoo!
