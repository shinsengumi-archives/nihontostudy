Is a green pap=\r\ner \nfrom the NBTHK 35 years ago the equivalent of a tokubetsu kicho paper \n=\r\n(or perhaps it has just turned green with age!)\n\nNamban tsuba are incredibl=\r\ny difficult to photograph, and this \ndifficulty is compounded when the meta=\r\nl is dark.  A tsuba of this \ngroup with a plano-convex profile is very unus=\r\nual - I have certainly \nnever seen one.  It has the ubiquitous, symmetrical=\r\n design of \naffrontes dragons facing the tama jewel (or is it a lotus bloss=\r\nom?, \nwith lashings of gold overlay.  The alternating, perforated design \ni=\r\nnside the mimi is a commonly found one, as is the chryanthemoid \nmimi.  Int=\r\nerestingly, the seppa-dai is only gilded on the omote \nsurface - I sometime=\r\ns wonder how well would the seppa sit on a seppa-\ndai such as this.  The ko=\r\ndzuka-hitsu is clearly a later addition.\n\nThe photographs are much too dark=\r\n to enable any deatailed assessment \nof the carving and undercutting, but i=\r\nt appears to be of quite good \nquality.\n\nDate?  Who am I to argue with 1670=\r\n, but that seems to be a pretty \nexact attribution.  Perhaps I would put it=\r\n rather later - what does \nthe kanteisho say?\n\nRegards, John.\n\n--- In nihon=\r\ntostudy@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Barry Thomas&quot; &lt;warlord@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Dear All,=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Whilst we are on the topic of Namban tsuba I have posted two (not \nso=\r\n good) images of my Namban tsuba that took a green paper at the \nfirst NBTH=\r\nK Shinsa in the USA mmm maybe 35 years ago.  The obverse \n(red background) =\r\nis convex whilst the reverse (green background) is \nflat.  A polisher visit=\r\ning once commented &quot;a good one!!&quot;.  Early Edo \nperiod ca 1670, I believe.\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; Oh, it&#39;s in my folder &quot;Barry Thomas&quot; third one on the first page \n(sorr=\r\ny, no tiny url.  Something else I have to learn how to do!).  \nJohn I think=\r\n I sent you these images quite some while ago???\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; \n&gt; Ba=\r\nrry Thomas.\n&gt; \n&gt;   ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt;   From: Ron Hartmann \n&gt; =\r\n  To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n&gt;   Sent: Thursday, December 07, 2006 7=\r\n:46 AM\n&gt;   Subject: Re: [nihontostudy] Re: Tsuba help\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   Dear John, =\r\nothers - \n&gt; \n&gt;   I&#39;ve posted a photo of the interesting namban tsuba that J=\r\nohn had \nreferred to earlier. The motif consists of dragons and catfish, a =\r\n\nshrine (with gold jewel peak), breaking waves and vines (?) in \nsukashi wo=\r\nrk. This large tsuba (84mm rnd. x 4mm thick) has Tokubetsu \nHozon certifica=\r\nte.
