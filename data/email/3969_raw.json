Looking forward to hearing more from you.\n\nJim\n\n\n\n  Greetings everyone,\n\n  I am new to the forum here, at least as a contributor...  I \n  have &quot;lurked&quot; here for some time, and finally decided it was time I \n  joined you all in your excellent discussions.  As a &quot;tsuba man,&quot; I \n  have especially appreciated the recent activity on this site.  You \n  are all so knowledgeable and generous with your thoughts and \n  comments---it certainly helps someone like me who is relatively new \n  to tsuba.  \n\n  I have very much enjoyed the Kantei of recent days, and the \n  excellent photographs of tekkotsu that Jim has provided.  It really \n  helps to have such images for reference.  \n\n  Fascinating thoughts, too, on the matter of aesthetic valuation of \n  tsuba in pre-Edo times.  Jim&#39;s refereces to the tea ware of the day \n  are intriguing as well.  \n\n  Anyway, I just wanted to introduce myself and express my \n  appreciation for the great activity on the board.  I will look \n  forward to seeing more, and to contributing a few words here and \n  there.  Best to all...\n\n  Steven\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
