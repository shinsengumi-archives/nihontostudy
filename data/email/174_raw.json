They look quite nice.  I can&#39;t see much of the other fittings.  It says that the tsuba is ko-Kinko.\n  Jim\n\n    Hi all, this site was bought to my attention and I found this Wak. Lovely little piece but I was particularly struck by the koshirae. I am guessing Goto,  I was discussing this with Barry Thomas and his guess was Mino Goto. Maybe Jim G could shed some light on it.\n\n    I was also curious about the papers, would they be Seikeido&#39;s own kantei papers ?.\n\n    http://www.seikeido.com/seikeido/1kanezumi.htm\n\n    The have some excellent tsuba and some wonderful swords. Bob R, have you been here ?, I would guess so.\n\n    Rich T\n\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n        Yahoo!
