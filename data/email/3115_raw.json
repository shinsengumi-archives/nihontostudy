It confused me a bit regarding a\ntsuba I was studying at the time.\n\nMy understanding is that it is more of an age\ndivision. For example, exact same Sasano tsuba is\nphotographed in 2 books. It is a mid 1500s piece. In\nthe older book it is called &#39;Heian Jo Sukashi&#39;. In\nanother book it is called &#39;Kyo Sukashi&#39; and the age is\ndenoted in the subsequent description.\n  I suppose you could call it a &quot;ko kyo&quot; sukashi, but\nsounds odd to me.\n\nI would have thought Richard George&#39;s first tsuba\ncould be called &quot;Heianjo Sukashi&quot; or late Muromachi.\n\n\nCurran\n\n\n\n--- David Zincavage &lt;jdz@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; I&#39;m a bit puzzled about Heianjo sukashi tsubas.  Why\n&gt; do you suppose it is that neither Torigoye nor\n&gt; Sasano discuss them?  Heianjo, in this case, I would\n&gt; assume, just means they were made in Kyoto.  So, how\n&gt; would Heianjo sukashi be different from  Kyo\n&gt; sukashi?  How does one identify these?\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been\n&gt; removed]\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n\n\t\t\n____________________________________________________\nSell on Yahoo!
