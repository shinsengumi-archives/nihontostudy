Later ones tend to be thinner.  The early Akasaka really favored a very &quot;high,&quot; rounded rim compared with other groups working at the same time.\n\n  Sometimes tekkotsu are seen in early examples.  Senkotsu is more common, which is a sort of long linear bone that forms where the inner and outer plates are joined.  \n\n  I&#39;m not sure if you intended there to be an attached photo.  The list doesn&#39;t permit attachments, but you can post images in the group photo album at:\n  http://groups.yahoo.com/group/nihontostudy/\n\n  Log in and click on the &quot;Photos&quot; link at the left.  I can provide detailed instructions for anyone who would like to learn how to post photos. It&#39;s quite easy.\n\n  Jim \n\n\n\n    Dear All,\n    I have been discussing the tsuba below with a number of friends from both this and another group. The concensus to date is that this is early Akasaka. While I am more than content with that attribution I was wondering how common the thick round mimi was in Aakasaka work? Also there are a lot of bones in the mimi. I understand that early Akasaka work was influenced by Owari tsuba, is this an example of this? or should I be looking in another direction.\n    All comments greatly appreciated.\n\n\n\n    ---------------------------------\n    Want to chat instantly with your online friends?
