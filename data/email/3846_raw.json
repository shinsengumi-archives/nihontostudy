As polishing pl=\r\nays a vital  \n&gt; role in determining the sword&#39;s final shape and appearance,=\r\n an  \n&gt; understanding of the polisher&#39;s art is essential for anyone  \n&gt; int=\r\nerested in this unique weapon.\n&gt; =E2=80=94FROM CHAPTER ONE\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; To underst=\r\nand Japanese sword polishing is to understand the  \n&gt; Japanese sword. Down =\r\nthrough the years, the great sword  \n&gt; connoisseurs in Japan have been swor=\r\nd polishers. A swordsmith can  \n&gt; spend a large amount of time forging a cl=\r\nassic sword, but refining  \n&gt; and bringing out its final shape, color, and =\r\ntexture so that all  \n&gt; the details of the steel and hamon (the temper line=\r\n) are clearly  \n&gt; visible is the responsibility of another craftsman\n&gt; =E2=\r\n=80=94the sword polisher.\n&gt;\n&gt; The Art of Japanese Sword Polishing is the fi=\r\nrst book in English to  \n&gt; examine in great detail the polisher&#39;s technique=\r\ns, for which they  \n&gt; may apprentice for as long as ten years. It illustrat=\r\nes the  \n&gt; methods, materials, and tools used for this process. But the boo=\r\nk&#39;s  \n&gt; true aim is to bring to readers an appreciation of the beauty of a =\r\n \n&gt; well-crafted Japanese sword. As readers learn both how the sword  \n&gt; po=\r\nlisher enhances the beauty of a blade and how he handles the  \n&gt; problems o=\r\nf coaxing out its finest qualities through his polishing  \n&gt; techniques, th=\r\ney will come to a higher understanding of the fine  \n&gt; art of making a Japa=\r\nnese sword, and be able to view, purchase, or  \n&gt; collect swords with great=\r\ner pleasure.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been remo=\r\nved]\n\n\n"
