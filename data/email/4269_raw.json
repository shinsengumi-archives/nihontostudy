I believe it\nis meant to impart an &quot;antique&quot; look, or maybe it&#39;s that &quot;wabi-sabi&quot; serpent\nrearing its ugly head again.  Either way, if an item looks to be of good quality\nand in good condition AND the gold looks worn, then it is more likely to be a\ndeliberate effect and original and NOT a &quot;condition problem&quot;.  I would sure like\nto know more about this.\n\nRegards,\n\nBarry Thomas.\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &quot;bungotakadasword&quot; &lt;MuramasaIII@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Tuesday, May 30, 2006 10:21 AM\nSubject: [nihontostudy] Re: Post dated Post Update (LOL)\n\n\n--- In nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com, &quot;klepet33319&quot; &lt;Ppeterdds@...&gt;\nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; http://www.aoi-art.com/fittings/menuki/itaku04.html\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; the color was toned with the technique called Suri-hagashi, covered\ngold was deliberately rubbed off. &quot;........\n\nthis is interesting, sure it&#39;s not &quot; condition problem &quot; ?
