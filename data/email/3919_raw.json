The 1000JY fee is for internal \nshipping with in Japan. The issue is, many sellers in Japan won&#39;t ship \ninternationally. They don&#39;t want the bother, and they don&#39;t pack items \nto ship out of the country. The intermediate buyer should handle all \nthat very well. Mine does.\n\nOf course everything is a risk and dropping 10K on a sword in an online \nauction is pretty risky anyway unless you really know what you are \ndoing. There&#39;s a lot to be said for holding something in the hand.\n\nRich\n\nexcelsiorilluminati wrote:\n&gt;  Hello Nichido, 8% on top of all the other fees does not seem cheap \n&gt; to me. If I was to buy a $10000 sword you get $800 dollars just to \n&gt; redirect it to me from a seller who could send it direct. Plus  1000 \n&gt; yen to have it delivered to you and the 1000 yen for who knows what. \n&gt; What would be the benefit? To us that is.
