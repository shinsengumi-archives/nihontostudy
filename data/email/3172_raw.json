Would you agree with that?\n\nThis tsuba is very difficult to photograph.  Its surface is very high relief, and the sahari is reflective.  The seller&#39;s photos are better than any I&#39;ve been able to make.  It looks a bit better in person.  It&#39;s &quot;mud puddle&quot; surface manages to convey simultaneously a sense of rustic wabe sabe simplicity and a sense that this is a really expensive luxury object which took an awful lot of trouble and skill to produce.  Rusticity as sold at Tiffany&#39;s, if you see what I mean.  \n\nDavid\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: Jim Gilbert \n  To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Friday, July 22, 2005 3:35 PM\n  Subject: Re: [nihontostudy] tsuba school\n\n\n  David,\n  It&#39;s sahari as Arnold and Rich have said.  It&#39;s not Hazama school sahari work though, which is the flush style of inlay that Arnold mentioned.  I&#39;ve seen several pieces of exactly this type, but no signed ones.  The plates look like later Myochin work.  On the ones I&#39;ve seen in person the sahari appeared contemporary with the plate.  It&#39;s possible that the sahari could be a later addition, but it&#39;s hardly something done to appeal to western taste.\n\n  I don&#39;t think that the overlapping squares add up to a genji mon.\n\n  Jim\n\n\n\n    Tom,\n\n\n    I&#39;m probably misusing the term shakudo.  Perhaps it&#39;s &quot;melted-on something-or-other zogan.&quot;   The tsuba is definitely old.  I do own a nice collection of Tokyo Planning Office beer coasters and paperweights, all made last week.    \n\n    David \n    http://zincavage.org/BrownTsuba.html\n\n\n\n\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  YAHOO!
