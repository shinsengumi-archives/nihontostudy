Is this\n&gt; as I hope the original edge?=\r\n \n&gt; * could the saya be an old one since it&#39;s lacquered?\n&gt; * since the grip=\r\n still has the sharkskin, safe to assume it&#39;s late \nbut not VERY late war\n&gt;=\r\n (when fishskin was abandoned)?\n&gt; * the field cover seems to have shrunk ov=\r\ner the saya. I&#39;d like to \nsee the scabbard in its \n&gt; glory. but -  best lea=\r\nve alone?\n&gt; * are the stamps in the saya cover more likely inspectors&#39; or \n=\r\nowner&#39;s?\n&gt; \n&gt; many thanks for the patience and help with these queries!\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; I&#39;ll try to load a few pix....\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"
