I looked in the Haynes index (whi=\r\nch I \nnow proudly own) and found no such name. It is without a doubt \nTADAH=\r\nIRO.\n\nI will send you pic&#39;s of another kogatana that has a mei. It looks \nv=\r\nery suspicious to me, and I have no idea what it says. I will post \nthem in=\r\nto my album and send you same directly. Maybe it will be \nlegit, maybe not.=\r\n Somebody at some time has tried to fake a hamon on \nthis little blade. I n=\r\need to remove this, any ideas? I don&#39;t want to \nspend any money on this bla=\r\nde unless the mei is real. Let me know \nyour thoughts. It&#39;s a learning expe=\r\nrience!\n\nThanks,\n\nElliott\n\n\n\n-- In nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Barry Tho=\r\nmas&quot; &lt;warlord@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; G&#39;day Elliot,\n&gt; \n&gt; Firstly the name is TADAH=\r\nIRO, not TADASHIRO.  I am well acquainted \nwith this smith as I have had a =\r\nkatana of his for many years plus \nothers of the school are well-known to m=\r\ne in other collections.  And \nI have the Hizento Taikan.  And I have a book=\r\n on kogatana.  So, \nplease post me pics direct or I&#39;m happy to look at them=\r\n in your \nalbum.  Higher res is better then lower res to send me direct, as=\r\n you \nmight resize them down for your album.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m presuming here that y=\r\nou want to know if the mei is genuine??\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; Barry Thomas.\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt;   From: Elliott \n&gt;   To: nihontostudy@yah=\r\noogroups.com \n&gt;   Sent: Tuesday, March 27, 2007 3:16 AM\n&gt;   Subject: [nihon=\r\ntostudy] kogatana mei\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   It&#39;s me again...........\n&gt; \n&gt;   I am seekin=\r\ng any information about....
