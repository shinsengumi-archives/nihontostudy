Ko Kinko are \nthe main culprits. Many of them are held together with two little \nrivets, the fukurin is more to finish off the the tsuba aesthetically. \nSee here (thanks Baz)\n\nhttp://www.nihonto-bijutsubu.com/personal/ko-kinko.jpg\nhttp://www.nihonto-bijutsubu.com/personal/ko-kinko-sanmai.jpg\n\nThe tsuba you are referring to as Sanmai, probably is Ko Kinko, but I \nguess we would need to see it to be able to make a call like that. \nKagami shi (kagami = mirror, shi = maker) usually made tsuba that were \ncast from bronze or yamagane.  I have not seen any sanmei kagamishi \ntsuba but that does not mean there were not any. I will have a look in \nSasano&#39;s little book tonight at home and see if there is any reference.\n\nThis is a typical Kagami-shi tsuba \nhttp://richardturner.wordpress.com/2009/01/17/130/\n\nMost likely, all 3 tsuba you have are Ko Kinko.\n\nCheers\n\nRichard\n \n\nElliott wrote:\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt; HELP! I need some clarification;\n&gt;\n&gt; Sanmai tsuba are tsuba made using three layers of metal held together \n&gt; by a fukurin. The word &#39;sanmai&#39; does not designate a school or group, \n&gt; correct?\n&gt; Kinko (Kinku) means metal worker. Ko-kinko is &#39;early&#39; metal worker? \n&gt; Tsubako is tsuba maker.\n&gt; Kagamishi - Is this a school (Ha) or metal worker? Do they or him make \n&gt; Sanmai tsuba? Is this related to the Kaga Ha?\n&gt;\n&gt; I have Ko-kinko tsuba, Sanmai tsuba, and one Kagamishi made tsuba. \n&gt; They all are made of three layers, held by fukurin. There is zogan on \n&gt; some, and all have some design formed by a substance under the outside \n&gt; layer of metal. How do you tell one from the other????\n&gt;\n&gt; I appreciate the time and education that you (all) give me.\n&gt;\n&gt; Elliott\n&gt;\n&gt; \n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
