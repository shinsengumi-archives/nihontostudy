I have yet to see if =\r\nthe blade is signed, but figure it is and need to know the swordsmith befor=\r\ne I know if it is junk or not.  While apart I will photo the tsuba and post=\r\n pictures.  The tsuba is loose right now to the extent that I can see that =\r\nit is signed, but of coures the symbol is undecipherable to me - it is a si=\r\nngle charater and I can&#39;t photo it due to the angle right now.  All I know =\r\nright now about this sword is that my one of my Husband&#39;s relatives, who wa=\r\ns a marine in WWII, got it on Okinawa during the war.  It is obviously not =\r\na WWII era sword and hence the mystery and intrigue.\n   \n  Becky\n\nRichard T=\r\nurner &lt;ikkanshi@...&gt; wrote:\n          agreed, no Heianjo, but no b=\r\nooks here, I know there are a few of these \nin Peabody&#39;s, well I think ther=\r\ne are.

Could you remove the tsuka and let\n&gt; us see the whole tsuba? bot=\r\nh sides? This will help ID the piece.
