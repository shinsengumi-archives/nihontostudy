Apparently, in Japan it is referred to a Manji symbol, and use=\r\nd on maps to indicate the location of temples.  \n\nI was told about a web-si=\r\nte which offered the following:\n\n____ The omote (&quot;front side,&quot; or since it =\r\nis customarily on the left side, left) [clockwise moving] manji represents =\r\ninfinite mercy, or the love of Dharma which permeates the universe and nurt=\r\nures all things. The ura (&quot;back side,&quot; or right) manji represents intellect=\r\n and strength. The Chinese are said to have derived their symbol for streng=\r\nth [symbol at very top of this page] from the ura manji. Although omote man=\r\nji and ura manji are customarily used side by side in Buddhism, the manji w=\r\norn on Shorinji Kenpo uniforms in Japan and many foreign countries, is set =\r\nas the omote manji. \n____ The spirit of caring for others as well as onesel=\r\nf is shown by the original teachings of Buddha. This path can be followed b=\r\ny using the intellect and strength symbolized by the ura manji to develop o=\r\nneself into a person who can be relied on, and who can serve humankind as a=\r\nn expression of the mercy and love represented by the omote manji \n\n\n\n____ =\r\nThe harmony of opposites symbolized in the manji includes the harmony of in=\r\ntellect with mercy, and strength with love. This harmony lies at the heart =\r\nof Kongo Zen&#39;s principle or riki ai funi, a principle which also gives guid=\r\nance to us in how we are meant to practice and to use the techniques of Sho=\r\nrinji Kenpo. Understanding the truths represented by the manji are vital to=\r\n understanding the heart of Kongo Zen. \n\nDavid\n\n\n\n\n\n  ----- Original Messag=\r\ne ----- \n  From: Afu \n  To: token_kenkyu_kai@... \n  Sent: Tue=\r\nsday, August 05, 2003 6:16 AM\n  Subject: Re: [nihontostudy] Re: &quot;temple car=\r\nving&quot; on tsuba\n\n\n  David,\n  There were a lot of small Buddhist Temples in V=\r\niet Nam with this symbol on top, in the same place you would see a cross on=\r\n a Christian edifice.\n  Ganbatte!\n  Afu\n  afu@...\n  For books i=\r\nn English on Nihon T=F4, go to:\n  http://www.afuresearch.com\n\n[Non-text por=\r\ntions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
