At 84 cms in width it is unusually large for the group - only =\r\n\nsome 3 per cent measure that or more, and the largest one I have seen \nwas=\r\n 93 cms.  It is also unusual in that it has two contemporaneous \nryo-hitsu,=\r\n and that these are both hangetsu-gata.  Does the smaller \none have sekigan=\r\ne?\n\nThe iron appears to be good, although the extensive carving on these \nt=\r\nsubas meant that the iron was never of very good quality.  The \ncarving of =\r\nthe undercut karakusa and the surface chisel-work are \nsharp and excellent.=\r\n  The plain, squared rim; the absence of OTT gold \noverlay; the conventiona=\r\nlly shaped seppa-dai and ryo-hitsu; and the \nasymmetrical design all combin=\r\ne to  impart a dignity that is seldom \nassociated with tsuba of this group.=\r\n\n\nThis is a beautiful tsuba, and well-deserving of its tokubetsu hozon \nsta=\r\ntus.  I am hesitant to give a firm time period.  On the one hand, \nbecause =\r\nof the introduction of better metal-working tools, those \nNamban tsuba of a=\r\n later period are generally the more skillfully \nmade.  Conversely, those w=\r\nith conventional seppa-dai were often \nearlier.  I imagine that the kanteis=\r\nho says &#39;Edo period&#39;?  Shall we \nsay mid-late C18? \n\nRegards, John L.\n\nP.S.=\r\n   I hope that you enjoy the book.\n\n--- In nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com, &quot;R=\r\non Hartmann&quot; &lt;swords@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Dear John, others - \n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ve posted=\r\n a photo of the interesting namban tsuba that John had \nreferred to earlier=\r\n. The motif consists of dragons and catfish, a \nshrine (with gold jewel pea=\r\nk), breaking waves and vines (?) in \nsukashi work. This large tsuba (84mm r=\r\nnd. x 4mm thick) has Tokubetsu \nHozon certificate. The poster is in Yahoo p=\r\nhotos: \nhttp://tinyurl.com/yxt45h\n&gt; in a file named: Ron STL  Perhaps John =\r\nwishes to elaborate on this \ntsuba a bit more? \n&gt; \n&gt; John, I&#39;ve just receiv=\r\ned my copy of your book, &quot;The Namban Group of \nJapanese Sword Guards; Aa Re=\r\nappraisal&quot; and I&#39;m looking forward to \ndigesting your research findings whi=\r\nch make up this publication. \nInteresting!\n&gt; \n&gt; Ron\n&gt; STL\n&gt; \n&gt;   ----- Orig=\r\ninal Message ----- \n&gt;   From: Dr John P Lissenden \n&gt;   To: nihontostudy@yah=\r\noogroups.com \n&gt;   Sent: Wednesday, December 06, 2006 7:37 AM\n&gt;   Subject: [=\r\nnihontostudy] Re: Tsuba help\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   Dear Patrick\n&gt; \n&gt;   Yes indeed - one=\r\n of the Namban group and probably made by a \ncasting \n&gt;   process in the ea=\r\nrly-mid C19. This group is characterised by its \n&gt;   openwork and undercutt=\r\ning; the common presence of affronted \ndragons \n&gt;   with the tama jewel; an=\r\nd the atypically shaped seppa-dai. All of \n&gt;   these are present on your ts=\r\nuba.\n&gt; \n&gt;   I would have expected a tsuba of this type to be of iron, but \n=\r\nsome \n&gt;   were cast in bronze. Interestingly these are unexpectedly \nattrac=\r\nted \n&gt;   by a magnet, but the admixture of up to 30% of iron to bronze in \n=\r\n&gt;   order to reduce the cost of the expensive alloy was not unknown. \n&gt;   A=\r\nlso, iron was a common inclusion in naturally occurring copper \nore \n&gt; \n&gt;  =\r\n Regards, John L.\n&gt; \n&gt;   --- In nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Patrick&quot; &lt;do=\r\nnuil_dhu@&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;   &gt;\n&gt;   &gt; Hi!
