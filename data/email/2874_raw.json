When I said Kaga and the Yoshiro, I meant Kaga Yoshiro and the Yoshiro of Kyoto area. (I think that&#39;s right, right?)\n\nWhen thinking Kaga Yoshiro, I&#39;ve had the impression that more often they would have squarish-type hitsuana; these are conventional shape with the kogai histsu being very &quot;rounded/drilled-like&quot; as you see on many of the Kyo-sukashi tsuba. That was my thinking here. Not sure why, but I also thought Kaga Yoshiro tsuba were more of a thinner plate than the others, but I&#39;m not sure where that idea came from. \n\nRon\nSTL\n\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: Alan Bale \n  To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Saturday, April 23, 2005 3:04 PM\n  Subject: Re: [nihontostudy] yoshiro school tsuba?\n\n\n  It looks like Kaga to me, don&#39;t forget that you also divide Yoshiro into\n  &#39;Kaga Yoshiro&#39; and &#39;Bizen Yoshiro&#39;.\n\n  Alan\n\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: &quot;dirk marshall&quot; &lt;dirkmarshall@...&gt;\n  To: &lt;nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n  Sent: Saturday, April 23, 2005 7:56 PM\n  Subject: [nihontostudy] yoshiro school tsuba?\n\n\n  &gt;\n  &gt; I bought this with the other and got a good deal as they were rusty.  I\n  was wondering if this could be a yoshino or kaga tsuba.  As you can see I\n  don&#39;t know much other than what I like.
