It could be Shoami, or it could for example be Kaga-zogan as in the guard I posted yesterday.  How much earlier Mitsutada might have been working before Myoju isn&#39;t clear, but even with him we only have examples with nijimei.  We don&#39;t know for sure whether or not he was associated with the Umetada.  He could have been a Kyo-Shoami worker.  I don&#39;t think that there are any fittings known to have been made by Myoju&#39;s father Shigetaka.   \n\nSasano said:\n&quot;Umetada Myoju established the style and the fame of the Umetada name, which flourished greatly after his time.  But he was not the first to make sword guards in the Umetada style.  Now unknown craftsmen and a certain Mitsutada are known to have done this kind of work before Myoju.  It seems likely that -- as the case with Shoami guards -- Umetada guards began being produced in the Muromachi period.  Those that predate Myoju are based on Shoami ideas and are called Ko-Umetada, or old Umetada.&quot;\n\nEven Sasano is making a rather narrow distinction between Ko-Umetada and Shoami.  \n\nMaybe evidence supporting the existence of Umetada workers predating Myoju will come to light.  \n\nOn the other subject, I still can&#39;t see the three characters at the bottom of the guard very well.  The character at the 3:00 position might be shu.  I don&#39;t have much confidence that I could read the characters even if I got a better look at them.\n\nJim\n\nPardon a dumb question. If you don&#39;t use Ko-Umetada,\nthen what term is used for pre-Myoju tsuba in the\nUmetada style?\n\nAny idea what the rest of the Soshu script translates as?\n\nRich\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
