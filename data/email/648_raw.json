It refers to the concentric ring-like\neffect when certain patterns (in particular those of a linear nature) are displayed on a computer\nmonitor, for instance.  Although I am by no means a desktop publishing expert, I would question\nyour need to scan at such a high resolution.  What will be the final format upon which your\nobjects are shown?  Website, print-out, computer screen?  Many scanners have high settings, but\nactually interpolate, or fill in the gaps, to create a false &#39;high resolution&#39;. Perhaps you could\nscan at 600 or so and capture enough information. \nAlso, I have found sometimes, that after you scan, you may see a moire pattern on the photoshop\nwindow, but if you enlarge or reduce the image by a step, the pattern goes away.  It&#39;s all about\ntrying to display a continuous image in a pixellated manner.\nRegards,\nDoug Sanders\n--- Gordon Robson &lt;robsongo@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Hi all,\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m looking for a little free advice on scanning. I am using a \n&gt; Canoscan9900F, which is a very good scanner. I begin my scans through \n&gt; Photoshop 7.0 into ScanGear CS. I have been using very high dpis of \n&gt; 1600 and 800 with the weak morei (spelling?) turned on and the sharp \n&gt; turned off. I am still getting nasty looking morei in my scans of \n&gt; oshigata for this summer&#39;s lecture. Any ideas on what I need to do to \n&gt; improve my scans?\n&gt; \n&gt; Gordon\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
