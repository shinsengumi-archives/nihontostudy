As Fred wrote, it will take awhile\n&gt; for this to sink in, but those who knew Ralph and\n&gt; those who know him from the San Francisco show and\n&gt; other shows would want to know about this. \n&gt; \n&gt; Ron Hartmann\n&gt; \n&gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt; From: Fred Weissberg \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Hello,\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; This is by far the most difficult email I have ever\n&gt; had to write.  Today is a black day indeed as we\n&gt; lost our dear friend, Ralph Bell.  The world is a\n&gt; sadder place today.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I just received a phone call from his wife, Theresa,\n&gt; and she told me that yesterday afternoon while he\n&gt; was returning from fishing, he lost control of his\n&gt; truck and was thrown to his death.  I really do not\n&gt; have any further details as the exact cause of death\n&gt; will not be forthcoming until after an autopsy is\n&gt; done tomorrow.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; The most important thing we can do for the family at\n&gt; this time is NOT call Theresa.  She is dealing with\n&gt; this tragedy with the family and does not need to go\n&gt; over the story multiple times.  She has requested\n&gt; that all calls go through me.  My home number is\n&gt; 650-595-1703.  I will follow up with further emails\n&gt; as more information is forthcoming.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; The full ramifications of this event has not sunk in\n&gt; yet and I am sure it will take awhile for each of\n&gt; you to believe it also.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Please contact any collectors who knew Ralph and\n&gt; pass the word along.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; For those of you who would like to send a card to\n&gt; Ralph&#39;s family here is his address:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Theresa Bell\n&gt; 650 Calle de la Plata\n&gt; Sparks, NV 89436\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Take care and say a prayer for the family tonight.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Fred\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ************************\n&gt; Fred Weissberg\n&gt; Nihonto.com\n&gt; ************************\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?
