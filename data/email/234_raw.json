Hell\neven paint will work as a glue in a pinch, you just\nhave to let it dry properly is all. But by far lacquer\nwill have a much tougher outer shell than any paint I\nknow of. Especially if it&#39;s built up in layers as I&#39;m\nsure these tsuba were.\n\nBob R\n\n--- alchemyst &lt;alchemyst@...&gt; wrote:\n Does lacquer itself have &quot;glue&quot; properties?
