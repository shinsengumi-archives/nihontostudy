These were a group of women who\nduring the season were engaged in the planting of rice,\nbut who during the off season made tsuba as a means\nof enhancing their incomes. These women tsuba makers\nwere excellent metal workers making well wrought tsuba\nplates that they sold either as finished products or to\nother schools of tsuba makers to embellish in that\nschools particular style. This is perhaps the only\nknown instance where women composed a major\nschool of tsuba makers.\n\nThanks to Jim and others for their research in\nbringing this important information to light.\n\nRich S\nApril 1, 2004 :-)\n\n\n"
