I do understand that the \nplacements of the menukis are such as they are exposed to a lot of wear, \nbut still the loss is significant. Is this always expected or could it \nbe that the gold have been poorly appliquï¿½d?\nI have a pair of another menuki with even more loss of gold, well only \non one of them. The other is probably replaced by a new made.\n\nhttp://hem.bredband.net/odrike/Menuki1.htm\nhttp://hem.bredband.net/odrike/Menuki2.htm\n\nFredrik\n\nJim Gilbert wrote:\n\n&gt;Ron,\n&gt;The other menuki is a sho with a side-blown flute depicted behind it.  The\n&gt;sho a mouth-blown reed instrument used in bugaku/gagaku (along with that\n&gt;type of flute, drums, etc.).  Masks are used in bugaku, some with\n&gt;exaggerated noses, but I don&#39;t know whether a tengu mask like that was used.\n&gt;\n&gt;Several books mention that the bugaku mask depicting the shinto god\n&gt;Sarutahiko no Mikoto is frequently confused with a tengu.  I think he&#39;s more\n&gt;of a big wide-nosed rather than long-nosed type, though.\n&gt;\n&gt;Jim\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;The\n&gt;&gt;one menuki depicts a &quot;tengu&quot; mask and the other (I think) a &quot;wisk.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;Somebody\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;else might know the association between these. I&#39;ve always like this &quot;long\n&gt;&gt;nosed tengu&quot; and have a mask on the wall of my sword room. Story has it\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;that\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;if you become a &quot;know it all&quot; and kind of an &quot;instant expert&quot; with your\n&gt;&gt;swords (not wanting to study or listen to your peers) your nose will grow\n&gt;&gt;like the &quot;long nose tengu.&quot; Neat, eh? Of course I have to explain that\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;story\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;when a new female visitor is around, least she get the wrong impression\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;and\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;think I&#39;m a dirty old man.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Menuki look pretty &quot;late&quot; but interesting.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Ron\n&gt;&gt;STL\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;Yahoo!
