            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1698324215\">Hi David,<br/>\n<br/>\n  I am just back from my holiday. I went to the Sothebys sale, but as I <br/>\nwanted to bid on one of the lots I had to miss the viewing. The sale was <br/>\nwell attended, with<br/>\n  quite a few Japanese dealers and I was told some from Taiwan as <br/>\nwell.There were I believe some Americans,  Europeans and the usual <br/>\nsuspects from the UK.<br/>\n  Prices were mostly over estimate so no doubt Neil Davey who was <br/>\nconducting the auction was well pleased. I left after some sixty lots <br/>\nhad passed because<br/>\n  I wanted to see the swords at Christies. I looked at about thirty five <br/>\nof the best swords but after that I had to stop. My eyes could not take <br/>\nin any more. You can only<br/>\n  really look at a small number at any one time. I came to the conclusion <br/>\nthat I would be happy to take home perhaps five of the swords, the rest, <br/>\nsome big names among<br/>\n  them, were not for me. You will know that at the sale prices went <br/>\nthrough the roof, but I am still not convinced that a number of the <br/>\nswords were correct. I was also<br/>\n  interested to see Caldwell&#39;s well known Ko Mino tsuba. It was much <br/>\nbetter in the hand than in the pictures I have seen of it, and I liked <br/>\nit very much. I have always<br/>\n  doubted though that it was Ko Mino, and as it sold for just over a <br/>\nthousand I guess that the Japanese doubted it as well. Ko kinko perhaps? <br/>\nMy friend is still ill so<br/>\n  our discussions were limited but he thought that the kyo attribution of <br/>\nour tsuba was more than likely correct. My own thoughts still linger on <br/>\nShoami but in the best<br/>\n  Japanese tradition I bow before the pronouncement of the Sensei.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Kind regards,  Charles.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Wednesday, November 10, 2004, at 04:49 PM, David Zincavage wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://tinyurl.com/5xyum\">http://tinyurl.com/5xyum</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!
