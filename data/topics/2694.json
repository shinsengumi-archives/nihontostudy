In my early days of collecting and<br/>\nintermittently over many years Mr Han and I enjoyed a lively correspondence.  He<br/>\nwas unfailingly helpful, even to an excess of research on my behalf.  Clearly,<br/>\nhe enjoyed the task because it increased his own knowledge and awareness of<br/>\nNihont么.  One only has to read his &quot;Study at the Sword Museum&quot; series of<br/>\narticles in the English NBTHK journals to see the depth of his knowledge and<br/>\ncommittment to Nihont么 studies and preservation.  His superior knowledge was<br/>\ninvaluable to me as I set about trying to find good swords as a beginner.<br/>\nThanks to his influence and stirling scholarly example, and that of many others<br/>\nin our little community, I have come to regard it as a sacred duty to pass on<br/>\nsuch freely given knowledge as I&#39;ve managed to gain over the years.<br/>\n<br/>\nOver the years Mr Han was a prolific author, although I haven&#39;t seen an article<br/>\nby him for quite some years now.  His writings were thorough pieces of research<br/>\neruditely expressed and meticulously footnoted.<br/>\n<br/>\nMr Han was a 9th (?) generation Chinese teaching in Indonesia before he left to<br/>\nlive in The Netherlands.  He was a lawyer, I believe.  I still have a photo of a<br/>\nkenukigata tachi with a gendait么 he acquired from one of his students, the son<br/>\nof one of President Soekarno&#39;s close aides.  Mr Han&#39;s wife died some two or so<br/>\nyears ago and I remember her passing being mentioned here.  He and his wife had<br/>\nno children.<br/>\n<br/>\nI haven&#39;t corresponded with Mr Han for some years now, but it is time to go and<br/>\nhave a read through our correspondence and shed a tear for this great man of<br/>\nNihont么, in whose shade those such as I still struggle to learn and understand.<br/>\n<br/>\nBest regards to all,<br/>\n<br/>\nBarry Thomas.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: jonosuke2003 &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:saemonjonosuke@...\">saemonjonosuke@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com\">nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Friday, March 11, 2005 10:58 AM<br/>\nSubject: [nihontostudy] Mr Han Bing Siong<br/>\n<br/>\nMr Han Bing Siong, Chairman of the Dutch Token past away today.<br/>\nHolland lost a great sensei............. </span></blockquote></div>",
