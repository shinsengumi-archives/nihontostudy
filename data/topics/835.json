            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1680311480\">hey guys,<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter photographing a couple  of my latest acquisitions:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://home.teleport.com/~rkg/photos/ko_kinko_front_small.JPG\">http://home.teleport.com/~rkg/photos/ko_kinko_front_small.JPG</a><br/>\n<br/>\nI got some complaints that this looked too &quot;milky&quot; (funny about that <br/>\nbecause I was using the<br/>\nol&#39; milkjug diffuser :-) )<br/>\n<br/>\nThese next couple of pics were taken using the traditional skim skim <br/>\nlighting that I normally use<br/>\non tsuba (see menuki3 and menuki4 in the yahoo photo album below:)<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://f2.pg.photos.yahoo.com/ph/rkgatteleport/lst?.dir=/menuki_test&.view=t\">http://f2.pg.photos.yahoo.com/ph/rkgatteleport/lst?.dir=/menuki_test&.view=t</a><br/>\n<br/>\nThis still had the highlights kind of &quot;blown out&quot; so I then tried a <br/>\ntechnique they had described in that<br/>\ncolor, light and magic book I&#39;ve been studyin&#39; - namely, putting a gobo <br/>\nbetween the light and the menuki.<br/>\nsince this renders the piece very dark, I had to up the exposure by a <br/>\ncouple of stops to compensate.  Note<br/>\nthat I didn&#39;t get them quite the right size and that you see a little <br/>\nblue from the painters tape I use to hold<br/>\nall this stuff up, but still...)  These can be seen in menuki3_gobo and <br/>\nmenuki4_gobo  I suspect<br/>\nI could darken up the background and improve things more, but...<br/>\n<br/>\nI also tried this with another recent acquistion using the same <br/>\nnomenclature (see menuki1 & menuki2 in this<br/>\nsame directory).  Here you can see that the gold doesn&#39;t get as &quot;washed <br/>\nout&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo what do you guys think?  Which method looks better?<br/>\n<br/>\nIn case you&#39;re bored, you can also check out my other photo directories <br/>\nhere - the pointer to some recent pics of<br/>\nmy Yamato shizu katana  is:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://tinyurl.com/ot2c\">http://tinyurl.com/ot2c</a><br/>\n<br/>\nObviously I did this during the day and need some more background to <br/>\nhide material (and a stronger spotlight and...),<br/>\nbut still...<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd finally, I&#39;ve turned to the dark side and have a Canon 10D coming, <br/>\nso the camera that took those pics above<br/>\nis for sale (canon G2 with a pile of interesting accessories (filters, <br/>\nfilter adapters, yada yada) - contact me privately<br/>\nif interested (just thought I&#39;d ask before throwing it up on ebay...).<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S.  Like the sword holder?  if anybody has a line on some 2&quot; square <br/>\nnylon, delrin, or some sort of uhmw pe plastic<br/>\nrod that is black, I&#39;d love to hear about it...</div>",
