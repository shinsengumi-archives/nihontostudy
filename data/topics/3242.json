I believe the owner made a substitution (he had<br/>\n&gt;   only so many slots and given me more items than he had<br/>\n&gt;   slots). Same owner as the Myochin.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   The design is exactly the same as Rich&#39;s, but it did<br/>\n&gt;   not feel Akasaka. The mimi on Akasaka usually feels<br/>\n&gt;   more full, rounded. Then the actual plate on the tsuba<br/>\n&gt;   was ~perfectly~ flat and the sukashi so crisp in<br/>\n&gt;   execution that it felt almost machined precise in<br/>\n&gt;   execution.<br/>\n&gt;       I mentally ruled out Akasaka, and was curious to<br/>\n&gt;   see the shinsa results on it. The fact that I don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;   would point towards either (a) early senility or (b)<br/>\n&gt;   that this was the one substituted out.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   Jim, (sidenote) at the time I was surprised at the<br/>\n&gt;   Myochin call on the other tsuba. I would have thought<br/>\n&gt;   that it ended up in some group I was less familiar<br/>\n&gt;   with. Interesting tsuba.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   Any preview on the Yagyu exhibit for those<br/>\n&gt;   international listeroos that won&#39;t get to see it?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   Curran<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>",
