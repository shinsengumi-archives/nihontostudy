            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1116215200\">Thanks Jim,<br/>\n<br/>\nI got the newsletter yesterday. I don&#39;t know if it was me or what, but I<br/>\nfound the first several paragraphs almost incomprehensible. I also noted the<br/>\nlack of mention of the Hawaii Taikai put on by the NTHK back in the early<br/>\n80s, which included a one month show at the Honolulu Academy of Arts, a one<br/>\nday display by craftsment and a lecture by Yoshikawa Kentaro sensei<br/>\n(brilliantly translated by me, I might add). I found myself agreeing to some<br/>\nof the points raised, but thinking there was a lot of over generalizing,<br/>\nparticularly in terms of disagreeing with &quot;sensei.&quot; It depends on the<br/>\nsensei. There is also something called politeness. Telling a man in his 80s<br/>\nthat he is full of it is probably not the best way to develop relationships.<br/>\nAs for Western scolarly works on Japanese swords, I think we can see this<br/>\nattitude everywhere, not just from the Japanese. What would you say to<br/>\nsomeone who told you that so and so was a famed Japanese professor of<br/>\nShakespeare? You are not only English, but an English professor yourself.<br/>\nYou have never heard of so-and-so. You also find out that so-and-so can&#39;t<br/>\nspeak English and has never published anything on Shakespeare in the English<br/>\nlanguage. I think you might have trouble accepting the statement that<br/>\nso-and-so is a famed professor of Shakespeare. Since most Western &quot;scolars&quot;<br/>\nof the Japanese sword do not publish in Japanese and may not even be able to<br/>\nread the language let alone speak it, I have little problem agreeing that<br/>\ntheir work might not be up to snuff. Bob, on the other hand, is recognized<br/>\nhere as being &quot;mekiki&quot; (good eyed) and &quot;erai&quot; (brilliant). Hagihara sensei<br/>\nwas blown away by his book. I have been writing a series in Japanese on the<br/>\nKanabo school, which has also been well recieved here. I don&#39;t want to be<br/>\nhard on Bob, but I thought there was some self-serving stuff in there, as<br/>\nwell as a bit of hypocricy, &quot;you&#39;re a bunch of dealers, but I ran an auction<br/>\nthat was educational.&quot; Hmmm.<br/>\n<br/>\nGordon<br/>\n  -----Original Message-----<br/>\n  From: Jim Gilbert [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jggilbert@...\">jggilbert@...</a>]<br/>\n  Sent: Friday, May 09, 2003 12:39 PM<br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com\">nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n  Subject: Re: [nihontostudy] Fw: Haynes article<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Here it is...<br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://tinyurl.com/bcac\">http://tinyurl.com/bcac</a><br/>\n<br/>\n  Jim<br/>\n<br/>\n  [BTW, I should have typed Cooper, not Copper...]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    The news letter has not made it over here yet, so I cannot comment on<br/>\nit.<br/>\n<br/>\n    G<br/>\n    ----------<br/>\n    From: &quot;Jim Gilbert&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jggilbert@...\">jggilbert@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n    To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com\">nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n    Subject: Re: [nihontostudy] Fw: Haynes article<br/>\n    Date: Thu, 8 May 2003 13:16:14 -0400<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    Ron and all,<br/>\n    Well, I&#39;d certainly like to see more major US displays, lectures, etc.,<br/>\nbut<br/>\n    I don&#39;t think that the situation is quite so bleak.<br/>\n<br/>\n    There have been other significant museum shows (Copper Union, Japan<br/>\nSociety,<br/>\n    Phoenix Art Museum, etc.), lecturers from Japan, and many smaller<br/>\ndisplays<br/>\n    put on in NY, LA and SF that are not associated with sword shows.
