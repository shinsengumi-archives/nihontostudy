I&#39;m not sure if any of them ever join but it is worth the <br/>\n  shot.<br/>\n  The real problem of this hobby is the expense.  You have to have a good <br/>\n  income and a good deal of time to learn.  Most young people don&#39;t have the money or <br/>\n  care to spend the time to learn (and I&#39;m not some old man bashing young <br/>\n  people, I&#39;m only 26).  Collecting is a sickness, and while many people are infected <br/>\n  only a limited number enjoy Japanese swords and fittings, etc.  Ebay is a <br/>\n  world wide community and there are people buying swords and tsuba everyday.  I&#39;m <br/>\n  sure that 20% don&#39;t even know about this list (my guess comes from no data <br/>\n  what so ever).  I think there is potential to recruit from the ranks of ebay.

John Yumoto <br/>\nhimself said the computer was the future of nihonto study and no matter <br/>\nhow much info we make available here, the hard work will still have to <br/>\nbe done in hand one blade at a time.<br/>\n\tThere is honestly no reason we cannot have all our references <br/>\ndownloaded and indexed in an online library. What I wouldn&#39;t give to <br/>\nhave just three books on my PDA! Electronic paper? I&#39;ll take a sheaf! <br/>\nSeeing what others have done with Tosho and what Darcy has done with <br/>\nhis database I wonder if I shouldn&#39;t have studied &quot;computer&quot; instead of <br/>\nJapanese.<br/>\n\tWhats missing? What would do the most good? Nagayama without a doubt. <br/>\nI use the Japanese but even when I use the Eigo I have days when I <br/>\ncan&#39;t find a particular smith even though I KNOW he is in there. <br/>\nComputer would solve that. The Meikan? absolutely if it is just a <br/>\nhobby, and you are not obsessed like me, then you want a quick <br/>\nreference to names and dates. This is the book and with minimal <br/>\nJapanese it&#39;s secrets can be unlocked. I would venture a great deal of <br/>\nuseful info is already in print, from the JSSUS and other US clubs. I <br/>\nexpect it would be easier to get them on board with a project to <br/>\nupdate, collate and disseminate all the info contained in those old <br/>\nnewsletters.<br/>\n\tAuthentication? Here&#39;s a big complaint. Newbiles have to visit dealers <br/>\nand silverbacks or even Japan to get an appraisal. Even were everything <br/>\nwe now have translated on line, the eye of an expert could never be <br/>\nreplaced. The clubs that do shinsa now, could save time and effort <br/>\noffering internet appraisals. Charging a nominal fee for reviewing <br/>\nscans and rubbings, this could be credited against a full shinsa <br/>\nsubmission. You&#39;ll have to deal with more junk on the whole, but a lot <br/>\nless in person and the whole process would feel more accessible to the <br/>\nhobbyist.<br/>\n\tThe tricks, scams, flaws and pitfalls could all be compiled on a <br/>\nsingle website. There could be a known fake database, to help prevent <br/>\nfuture frauds. There will still be people who don&#39;t bother to visit it <br/>\nand some people won&#39;t listen no matter how many times or ways you <br/>\nexplain &quot;fatal flaw&quot; or &quot;fake signature&quot;. So again the internet will be <br/>\na big help but it won&#39;t be able to save everyone.<br/>\n\tLectures and study groups. Martial arts dojo bring &quot;experts&quot; over for <br/>\nseminars all the time. There is no reason we cannot. We have Dr Robson <br/>\nof the NTHK making annual presentations of the kind and quality seen in <br/>\nJapan, others have come in the past, why not invite them over? The <br/>\nargument against seems to be the money. Not enough members willing to <br/>\npay for an evening with Fukunaga Suiken? Well Rock stars do online <br/>\ninterviews why not the stars of nihonto? Hire a translator, sit at a <br/>\nterminal and rock out. Better yet set up a video conference, don&#39;t <br/>\nallow questions just broadcast the kantei kai, or let Sensei talk for <br/>\nan hour each week on whatever he likes. However as Clive has mentioned <br/>\nwithout your alls support...<br/>\n\tI have talked about virtual swords one could hold in a sensor-gloved <br/>\nhand and examine to your hearts desire and  a slew of virtual Sensei <br/>\ngiving lectures on each of these. Check out e-kokuho at the Tokyo <br/>\nNational Museum, virtual swords presented at various magnifications and <br/>\nin different light, excellent photography. We aren&#39;t so very far from <br/>\nthis but can&#39;t we digitize the old lectures of John Yumoto? Put them up <br/>\nas audio files that play with subtitles? Digitize what film we have of <br/>\nhim and others, add updated graphics, background notes, subtitles, <br/>\noshigata and still photos?<br/>\n\tShijo kantei! Why not a for fee monthly kantei? The same swords that <br/>\nare in the magazine. This way overseas members don&#39;t have to fool with <br/>\npostage and have more time to crunch the problem before the deadline. <br/>\nCreate a new category of e-member, $15 or $20 bucks a year for a <br/>\npasscode to access the members only pages allowing them to try their <br/>\nhand at kantei . Virtual shinsa could be a priveledge for only those <br/>\nwith a full or e-membership and passcode. Member profiles could be part <br/>\nof the site. Imagine your picture and list of wants or area of <br/>\nexpertise listed for any and all interested parties to see. Friendships <br/>\nand business contacts could be made, you might even place that name <br/>\nwith a face you remember from the taikai.This is where we are headed, <br/>\nwe only have to wait to see who does it first.<br/>\n\tWanting to see all these advances, I can barely afford to pay all the <br/>\ndues, but then cannot afford to let any of these great clubs fade away. <br/>\nIf  it is not your club it can be, join up now. Waiting for the reform <br/>\nand withholding your dues will likely only slow the change. Plunk down <br/>\nthe money and be active and we can have all the things on our wish <br/>\nlist. Answer the door Neo!<br/>\n-t</div>",

The very first person I went to <br/>\nwas a dealer, who as Harry has pointed out, risked the safety and <br/>\nsecurity of his family and collection by welcoming into his home a <br/>\ncomplete stranger. I didn&#39;t get cookies and milk but did get the honest <br/>\nappraisal I had asked for and an introduction to people who could <br/>\nfurther me in my areas of interest. He didn&#39;t know it then but it was a <br/>\nlife-changing meeting for me.<br/>\n\tFor some years I was reluctant to join the clubs because I was <br/>\nconcerned that a newbie wouldn&#39;t be able to keep up and might be <br/>\nunwelcome. Not the case however, I have learned a great deal from every <br/>\none of the members of my club and we are always happy to see new faces. <br/>\nNew faces with or without stuff in hand I might add. You are all <br/>\ninvited to join us at the NCJSC anytime you are in town and your <br/>\nschedule permits.<br/>\n\tI write travelogues and grade school level essays on subjects of <br/>\ninterest to me for our newsletter. It was several years after I joined <br/>\nthat I took up the challenge to contribute. I didn&#39;t know much then, <br/>\nstill don&#39;t now but I love a good tale and have a hard time resisting <br/>\nan empty pulpit.I am also unafraid of being wrong. Not sure this is a <br/>\ntalent but we all pitch in with with those skills we bring with us to <br/>\nmake the club the best we can. I have seen some great changes in the <br/>\nlast ten years and fully expect more as some of us newbies start to <br/>\nflex our muscles.<br/>\n\tThe question was what is wrong and what can we do to fix those <br/>\nproblems. Having studied briefly in Japan I find little wrong with what <br/>\nis happening there, education, study, and publication continue. There <br/>\nis a world of new info published each month, there are kantei-kai and <br/>\ntaikai providing unparalleled opportunities for growth. With the birth <br/>\nof the American Branch of the NBTHK alot of that will now be available <br/>\nto us unlucky enough to live here in the land of the 9.99 pizza. Ok <br/>\nmembership could be cheaper, but would be worth it at double the cost.<br/>\n\tWe don&#39;t do enough here to spread the word and bring in new members. <br/>\nVisits to local schools ( as a list member suggested awhile back), a <br/>\ntable at Martial arts tournaments, more advertising and other ways of <br/>\nreaching out are all possible. I for one would like to see more <br/>\ntranslations, but we have the NBTHK and the NTHK and soon translations <br/>\nfrom Dr. Robson from the JSSUS, what isn&#39;t being transmitted? Thats <br/>\ngist for another thread perhaps, but it seems the material is being <br/>\nmade available and each publication/organization has their area. It <br/>\nain&#39;t coming out fast enough, I agree, afterall I went to Japan to try <br/>\nto learn the lan-gauge and accelerate the learning process but it is <br/>\ncoming out.<br/>\n\tI also want to see older material rehashed, wouldn&#39;t it be great if we <br/>\ncould do an oshigata issue, going back to the original &quot;masters&quot; I <br/>\nwould love to see biographies of long time collectors, taped interviews <br/>\nand a history of our clubs. We have a &quot;convention&quot;, it is in San <br/>\nFrancisco. If there is a beginner topic you want to learn about the <br/>\nclub is always looking for monthly topics tell us what areas you want <br/>\nto explore.<br/>\n\tMentoring? certainly can&#39;t argue with that, wish I had one myself. <br/>\nSince I have a voice, thanks to this medium, I always try to answer <br/>\nnewerbie questions and always help folks who contact me off line and I <br/>\nhave received lots of help from other listeros myself. Again my <br/>\nexperience has been a positive one. This medium you ask? Yes lots to <br/>\nsay on that but will make that a separate thread.<br/>\n\tAnyway what&#39;s up is,is that interest is down, membership is down and <br/>\nthe time is ripe for a small group of motivated individuals to <br/>\nrevolutionize these clubs and this study. Maybe all we need is you, I <br/>\nam here already and I am ready to create the future...<br/>\n-t</div>",
