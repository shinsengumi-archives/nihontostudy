            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1971455032\">Hi Ron,<br/>\n  Sorry no I won&#39;t be there. I live in the north of the UK so it is a long trip. I am sure it will be a good event. <br/>\n  Regarding your question about Naokatsu and Kajihei, I have two swords which are relevant. The first is a wakazashi which appears to be a copy of an O-suriage bizen blade which has NBTHK green papers to Naokatsu. The second, and the one I am currently investigating, appears to be an O-suriage tachi with a partial sayagaki to Bizen Osafune Kagemitsu. However to me and others who have seen it it appears more likely to be a shin-shinto copy. The quality of the work, particularly the hada and the Utsuri suggests Naokatsu but in trying to prove it the name of Kajihei cropped up. It appears he was a very accomplished smith initially making copies of shinto pieces of both Kotetsu and Inoue Shinkai and more latterly by Osafune school smiths. The grey area appears to be in his intent. Where Naotane, Naokatsu etc made copies Kajihei appears to have made counterfeits which were intended to deceive. There are apparently many Kotestsu blades by this smith and at least one book has been<br/>\n published in the past of Oshigatas of his work.<br/>\n  If the sword under study is by him then I have no doubt that he was an incredible smith. I find it very sad that such talent should be used to deceive either through circumstance or malice.<br/>\n<br/>\nRon Hartmann &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:swords@...\">swords@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n          Paul - <br/>\n<br/>\nNo info for you but I did want to mention that I&#39;m doing an exhibit on Naokatsu (and other shinshinto smiths loaned by others) at the upcoming Minneapolis show and shinsa on the 15th.
