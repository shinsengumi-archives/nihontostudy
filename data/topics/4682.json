I remember my <br/>\ndistress some years ago when, upon being informed of my research on <br/>\nthe group, a senior member of the To-ken scene in GB replied Oh Dear, <br/>\nbut he supposed that somebody had to do it!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe tsuba that Ron describes as being &#39;made in two pieces&#39; is <br/>\nprobably one of many tsuba which were made in the mid-C19 for sale to <br/>\nforeigners in Nagasaki.  These were made in two non-contiguous halves <br/>\nthat, when joined together gave the impression of undercutting.  In <br/>\nthe better of these they were joined by a mimi; in the others they <br/>\nwere simply soldered together.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Hozon Namban tsuba posted by Richard is very nice.  The gold <br/>\nsleeves that he comments upon appear to be inserts intended to tidy <br/>\nup the irregularities in the design left by the later addition (or <br/>\nshould I say subtraction) of the ryo-hitsu.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease keep them coming.<br/>\n<br/>\nRegards, John L.<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com\">nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Ron Hartmann&quot; &lt;swords@...&gt; <br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Dear John - <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Well you tweeked the ego button...will post a photo or two of that <br/>\n </span></blockquote>nice namban early-on this week.

Evidence exists in Japan of the extensive use of both <br/>\nthe &#39;closed form&#39; and the &#39;lost form&#39; methods of casting - the former <br/>\nbeing known in China as early as the Zhou dynasty (1122-249 BC) and the <br/>\nlatter being introduced there &#39;relatively late&#39;. <br/>\n<br/>\nMany Japanese artefacts could only have been produced by the use of <br/>\nthis tecnique, and kagami are but one example of this. The detail of <br/>\nmany cast objects, especially in bronze, could not have been acheived <br/>\nany other way.<br/>\n<br/>\nThus my belif in the casting of Namban tsuba presumes the use of <br/>\na &#39;lost form&#39; method.  The naked-eye evidence of casting; the knowledge <br/>\nthat this form as casting was widely known in Japan; and the acceptance <br/>\nthat no other contemporanerous method of casting could have produced <br/>\nthese artefacts seem to support this presumption. <br/>\n<br/>\nI would be interested to hear your further comments.<br/>\n<br/>\nRegards, John L.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com\">nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;nihontochicken&quot; &lt;rick@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com\">nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Dr John P Lissenden&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &lt;docliss@&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I am personally convinced that the vast majority of Namban<br/>\n&gt; &gt; tsuba are cast and the poor quality of many of these makes this very<br/>\n&gt; &gt; easy to detect with the use, simply, of a bright light and x30<br/>\n&gt; &gt; magnification. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; While the &quot;straight through&quot; pierced tsuba may have been made via a<br/>\n&gt; two piece mold, the 3-D &quot;crossover vine&quot; type Namban tsuba, if cast,<br/>\n&gt; could only have been done so by a lost wax or similar method, not by a<br/>\n&gt; &quot;take apart&quot; mold.

            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2129861245\">Dear Elliott<br/>\n<br/>\nYour general question re the use of casting tecniques for the <br/>\nproduction of tsuba, although probably asked in all innocence, opens a <br/>\nwhole &#39;can of worms&#39;.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is no doubt that casting was accepted as a skilled form of <br/>\nmetalworking and was used to produce cast bronze vessels and mirrors, <br/>\nand iron kettles.  Indeed, a cast kagami is one of  the Three Sacred <br/>\nRegalia of Japan.  Kagami-shi tsuba, supposedly made in the pre-Edo <br/>\nperiod by mirror makers, may also be of extremely high quality and it <br/>\nis not illogical to suppose that many soft-metal tsuba may have <br/>\ninitially been cast.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut the casting of iron tsuba is, for some reason, very frowned upon by <br/>\ncollectors.  I am personally convinced that the vast majority of Namban <br/>\ntsuba are cast and the poor quality of many of these makes this very <br/>\neasy to detect with the use, simply, of a bright light and x30 <br/>\nmagnification.  The ease with which casting can be identified clearly <br/>\ndepends upon the amount of hand finishing which was utilised afterwards.<br/>\n<br/>\nMany people will justify the casting of Manban tsuba as being expected <br/>\nbecause of their poor quality, but I believe that casting may have been <br/>\nused far more generally than is accepted.  It should be a simple matter <br/>\nto confirm this, but such examinations would need to be carried out on <br/>\ntsuba of accepted high quality in order to avoid the a priori excuse <br/>\nof &#39;poor quality&#39;.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhite cast iron is not a suitable metal for casting, but the <br/>\ncarburisation of grey cast iron to produce  a malleable cast iron, <br/>\nwhich is ideal for casting small artefacts such as tsuba, is a process <br/>\nthat has been known in Japan for several hundred years.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs to whether the tsuba illustrated in your photo album is cast or not, <br/>\nI would hesitate to offer a firm opinion without a hands-on <br/>\nexamination.  But my first impression is the absence of any clean, <br/>\nsharp chisel-work - I have my suspicions!<br/>\n<br/>\nRegards, John L.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com\">nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Elliott&quot; &lt;elliott@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My question today is.........
