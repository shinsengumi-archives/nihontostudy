He is listing if for quite a bit <br/>\ncheaper than he paid for it.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is hard to find a NTHK papered Echizen 27 inch katana for <br/>\n$2,625.00 - if not impossible.  The blade is in old polish and has <br/>\nsome slight inactive rust in the kissaki - not very bad at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe blade has a very nice feel to it, it is not a heavy blade at all.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.japaneseswordcollector.com/echsek/echsek.html\">http://www.japaneseswordcollector.com/echsek/echsek.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nPlease contact me if interested.<br/>\n<br/>\nRegards,<br/>\n<br/>\nLouis Skebo</div>",
