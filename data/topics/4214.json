            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-256246998\">just back from the Chicago show and here&#39;s the personal <br/>\nprospective.........<br/>\nno Japanese dealers present due to the big holiday in Japan at the <br/>\nsame time, so next year the show may switch to a different date.  <br/>\nJust speculation , ok ?<br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally I did a lot of buy/sell/trade............<br/>\nas usual Walberg brought along his boxes of goodies and emptied my <br/>\nwallet. Among the new toys I bought from the Big Guy is a signed Goto <br/>\nschool single fuchi with a peacock motif which matches exactly my <br/>\nother mumei fuchi...so now I am quite positive the other unsigned <br/>\npiece is of the Goto school.<br/>\n<br/>\nDid see a few &quot; big money &quot; changed hands so there&#39;s some &quot; actions &quot; <br/>\ngoing on there .<br/>\n<br/>\nAs usual Jim gave an excellent presentation/discussion  on what make <br/>\na good tsuba.  I,  being my usual self with the big mouth , actually <br/>\nhas the audacity to say a tsuba &quot; turned me off &quot;......with <br/>\nstrange/interesting result !!  Jim did mention there&#39;s no right or <br/>\nwrong answer regarding the tsuba so i figure why not......<br/>\n<br/>\nBenson&#39;s tsuba price is very very reasonable at the show but too bad <br/>\nI dropped all my $ at Hagrid&#39;s.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe best part of the show is still touching bases with old friends, <br/>\ntelling the same ole stale jokes and seeing everyone is still alive <br/>\nand kicking........<br/>\nPerfect weather throughout and to cap the day, i get to spot the <br/>\nresident red tail hawk&#39;s nest and see the magificient bird flying and <br/>\ndoing well.<br/>\nFor more detail and insightful report............ that you have to <br/>\nwait till Barry gets home.<br/>\n<br/>\nMilt</div>",
