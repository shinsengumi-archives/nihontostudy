            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1673470561\">Milt,<br/>\nAgreed, Sharaku prices are positively Tokubetsu Juyo.<br/>\n<br/>\n1. One or two tekkotsu are usually more interesting than none.  Most good pieces of the types that have tekkotsu will have them distributed here and there around the rim.  Some pieces are positively bristling with them, and while it&#39;s a matter of taste it can get to be a bit much.  While one or two small bones may not have much carry much &quot;aesthetic weight&quot; they are a pretty good clue that the iron is not just homogenous factory plate.<br/>\n<br/>\n2.  Yes, they&#39;re mostly visible on the rim only, although Kanayama, Yamakichi, Hoan, etc., will show them on the face as well.  I think that it may be a function more of how the plate is finished than the forging.  If you file/grind/sand the surface down, the bones aren&#39;t going to be visible unless some later process (rust, wear, ?) brings them out.  I think that where to &quot;put&quot; or &quot;leave&quot; bones was an aesthetic choice.<br/>\n<br/>\n3.  There are running bones and there is masame hada.  The ones that really look like masame hada are just the layers in the iron.  I think typically if they stand out the guard was finished with some sort of etching process, or the layers were brought out by rusting.  A running bone is not as obvious or as uniform as masame hada.  It&#39;s a true tekkotsu that will be visible for a centimeter or few around the rim.  It is also probably following a higher carbon layer, but it&#39;s not as obvious as a masame hada.  It&#39;s frequently seen in early Akasaka.<br/>\n<br/>\n4.  Without seeing the piece I don&#39;t know.  I&#39;ve never seen inlay used to fill in voids in the forging, though.  On the other hand, if some of the gold fell out, you will still see the slots cut for the inlay.  Nunome should be a definite but shallow cross hatch (cloth) pattern.  Of course hira-zogan or other techniques would be small cuts.   <br/>\n<br/>\nShort form answers, but I hope that gets at your questions.<br/>\n<br/>\nJim<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">   &gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>  yes, of course.

It may be possible that we are <br/>\ndogmatizing the whole iron tsuba field, in other words making it more <br/>\nimportant than it was ever viewed by the people of those times.  Now <br/>\nit is also important to remember that there is nothing wrong with <br/>\nrecognizing artistic beauty where it was not appreciated before.  I <br/>\njust have to wonder if sometimes we are overdoing it, that&#39;s all.  <br/>\nThe &#39;beautiful&#39; tekotsu bumplies on the mimi were just not worth the <br/>\ntime or effort to smooth off, and the &#39;surface texturing&#39; was done to <br/>\nhide the irregularities in the metal.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com\">nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;bungotakadasword&quot; <br/>\n&lt;MuramasaIII@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com\">nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;klepet33319&quot; &lt;Ppeterdds@&gt; <br/>\n&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; OK -- now this is heresy, blasphemy, and possibly a bit of <br/>\n </span></blockquote>idolitry <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; throwm in for good measure.

From my reading, the truly outstanding<br/>\nsmiths were able to do both: have a great plate while<br/>\nhaving a superb design.
