            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-872892518\">Hi, all.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI just joined the group, looking for information.  I hope this post is<br/>\nappropriate.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a sword that was given to me by my father.  I believe he<br/>\nacquired it in the mid 1960s from someone who brought it back from<br/>\nWWII.  I know I remember him having it before 1968.  As far as I can<br/>\ntell from my research on the &#39;net, it is a &#39;kyu gunto.&#39;<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m trying to find the value of this sword.  I know that an appraisal<br/>\ncannot be done via the &#39;net, but I&#39;m hoping someone could give me<br/>\nestimated upper and lower limits, so I can decide if it is even worth<br/>\npursuing an official appraisal.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only local (northern Georgia, USA) help I have found is a referral<br/>\nto someone who has a booth at the local gun shows, who supposedly buys<br/>\nand sells Japanese militaria.  Eastman is having a gun show in Atlanta<br/>\nthis weekend and in Gainesville next weekend, and I&#39;m trying to decide<br/>\nwhether it is worth driving there and paying to get in the show, for<br/>\nthe possiblity of getting an appraisal.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you feel inclined to take a look at some photos and give me clue<br/>\nwhether I have something of value or just a piece of junk, I would<br/>\nappreciate it.  To that end I have posted some photos on my website at<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hillfamily.org/david/sword/.\">http://www.hillfamily.org/david/sword/.</a><br/>\n<br/>\nthanks,<br/>\nDavid Hill<br/>\nSautee-Nacoochee, GA, USA</div>",
