I don&#39;t think that it is so old or worn down.  It is done in Nara style, but is probably later shiiremono given the quality of the plate and inlay.  I don&#39;t see oni horns on the front... they look more like the tops of pagoda done in Kaneie-style landscape.  The &quot;blossoms&quot; are probably just the usual depiction of pine needle whorls.

On the first<br/>\n            side, it has an oni sitting happily beneath a flowering tree by the light of<br/>\n            a full moon, while below him a snail crawls by. Moon, blossoms, and the<br/>\n            oni&#39;s horns are gold.  On the reverse, the oni is disappearing away from us,<br/>\n            as the snail crosses the bottom in his direction.<br/>\n<br/>\n            Are tsubas this worn considered to be severely diminished in value?<br/>\n<br/>\n            Is anyone acquainted with a Japanese oni-and-snail story?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n          [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n                Yahoo!

It may be an original Nara piece done in a more subtle style or a later Nara school work.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  From your pictures it is very difficult to tell the color or quality of the iron plate which is the determining factor in iron tsuba and its quality.<br/>\n<br/>\n  The flower and other work seem to be of the Nara school work even if they are hard to see. I would think if someone would go to the trouble to make a copy of a Nara tsuba they would make it a little more flamboyant or copy one of the Nara masters.<br/>\n<br/>\n  John<br/>\n    ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n    From: David Zincavage <br/>\n    To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com <br/>\n    Sent: Wednesday, July 02, 2003 10:14 PM<br/>\n    Subject: Re: [nihontostudy] tsuba questions<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    Thank you for trying.

I don&#39;t think that it is so old or worn down.  It is done in Nara style, but is probably later shiiremono given the quality of the plate and inlay.  I don&#39;t see oni horns on the front... they look more like the tops of pagoda done in Kaneie-style landscape.  The &quot;blossoms&quot; are probably just the usual depiction of pine needle whorls.

On the first<br/>\n        side, it has an oni sitting happily beneath a flowering tree by the light of<br/>\n        a full moon, while below him a snail crawls by. Moon, blossoms, and the<br/>\n        oni&#39;s horns are gold.  On the reverse, the oni is disappearing away from us,<br/>\n        as the snail crosses the bottom in his direction.<br/>\n<br/>\n        Are tsubas this worn considered to be severely diminished in value?<br/>\n<br/>\n        Is anyone acquainted with a Japanese oni-and-snail story?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n            Yahoo!
