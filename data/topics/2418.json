My problem now is research.  Out of <br/>\nall my books (which is a fair number) I have only one reference to <br/>\nthis kind of weapon- in Arms and Armor of the Samurai by Hopson and <br/>\nBottomley.  If anyone out there can assist me in finding further <br/>\nreferences, pictures or other info I would sincerely appreciate it.<br/>\nThanks for your time.<br/>\nKirk</div>",
