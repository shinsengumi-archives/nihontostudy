His conclusion has been that the later edition is<br/>\nmore complete and accurate and therefore the better reference.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course that still leaves me wondering *which* book it was that supposedly<br/>\nhad many gimei in the first edition ... or if my memory is manufacturing<br/>\nthings.<br/>\n<br/>\nCraig Harris <br/>\nwww.bridgeofdreams.com</div>",
