I think<br/>\n&gt; this is NOT entirely germane to the point the NC is making, but Bill argued<br/>\n&gt; that a factor that contributed to the ability to set up the compressive<br/>\n&gt; tension was the fact that nippon-to are in essence composite structures.<br/>\n&gt; That is, they are combination of different orders of steel heightens a<br/>\n&gt; blade&#39;s ability to hold the cutting edge in compression.

I appreciate your delving <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; through the massive week&#39;s input to nihonto ramblings and picking <br/>\n&gt; the <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; wheat from the chaff.  I hope I don&#39;t pop a bubble here, but <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; re &quot;flexibility&quot;, the thickness of the kawagane vs. the shingane <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; doesn&#39;t make any difference from a metallurgical viewpoint.  It <br/>\n&gt; is <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; perhaps surprising that all iron and steels have the same Young&#39;s <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; modulus (ratio of strain to stress in the elastic region).  This <br/>\n&gt; is <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; perhaps amazing, in that, say, low carbon steel (as in shingane) <br/>\n&gt; is <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; mostly pearlite embedded in body centered cubic iron matrix, <br/>\n&gt; whereas <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; quench hardened kawagane and hagane is mostly acicular needles of <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; martensite, body centered tetragonal unit cell.  And yet (to me, <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; counterintuitively), the Youngs moduli are the same.  For the <br/>\n&gt; same <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; elastic stress, the same elastic strain (bending) results.  Now, <br/>\n&gt; this <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; applies only up to the elastic limit in the gross sense.  That <br/>\n&gt; is, at <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; a certain point, soft steel will permanently bend at a lower <br/>\n&gt; applied <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; stress than a hard steel.  But as long as neither&#39;s elastic limit <br/>\n&gt; is <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; exceeded, the &quot;flexibility&quot; is identical.  As a personal note, I <br/>\n&gt; have <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; read supposed old Japanese comments that western swords are &quot;too <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; flexible&quot;.  Again, this makes no sense below the elastic limit.  <br/>\n&gt; All <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; iron and steel acts the same below the elastic limit.  The <br/>\n&gt; difference <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; is that, at a certain stress, Japanese blades will permanently <br/>\n&gt; bend, <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; whereas the overall harder European blades will not.  Then again, <br/>\n&gt; the <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; European blades may be more prone to brittle fracture.  But this <br/>\n&gt; very <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; much depends on the quality of the individual Japanese and <br/>\n&gt; European <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; blades being compared.  But, in general, European swords are no <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; more &quot;flexible&quot; than Japanese blades, and no Japanese swords are <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; more &quot;flexible&quot; than any others; it only depends (roughly) on the <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; cross-section vs. length, up to the point the blades are <br/>\n&gt; permanently <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; bent.  And, generally, Japanese blades (hard edge, soft core) <br/>\n&gt; will <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; permanently bend before European swords (spring steel throughout) <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; will (but, then again, maybe not fracture).<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; NC<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nihontostudy-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\">nihontostudy-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Your use of Yahoo!

            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1811057281\">Peter (and Folk) -<br/>\n<br/>\nYou are correct re the compressive residual stress inside a nihonto <br/>\nha, which allows the very brittle martensite to survive the quench <br/>\nhardening process (well, usually).  However, this residual <br/>\ncompressive stress is enhanced by the relative expansion of the <br/>\nmartensitic ha as compared to the ferritic/pearlitic core, but is not <br/>\nfundamentally caused by it.  Due to the much more rapid cooling of <br/>\nthe ha, there would be a residual compressive stress left in it even <br/>\nwere there no phase transformations at all, such as in a uniform <br/>\naustenitic nickel steel.  I am dubious, however, as to how much this <br/>\nresidual compressive stress adds to the longevity of the ha in battle <br/>\nuse.  Imagine the brittle ha under compression like a string of, say, <br/>\n20 child&#39;s wooden blocks squeezed between your hands.  Push really <br/>\nhard!  Now have someone tap the middle block from one side, and watch <br/>\nthe blocks spray out.  And so I&#39;ve seen nihonto with big chips blown <br/>\nout of the ha, perhaps likewise ejected by an off-center, sideways <br/>\nstrike to the ha by something hard.  In any event, I don&#39;t think any <br/>\nof the following has any effect on the &quot;flexibility&quot; issue, the <br/>\nelastic bending of the sword below the yield stress or brittle <br/>\nfracture stress.  Again, &quot;flexibility&quot; of an iron/steel sword does <br/>\nnot depend on carbon/alloy content or heat treatment.  Not intuitive <br/>\nat all to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW, I obviously forgot which list I was on in a previous reply, and <br/>\nso apologize.  Also, the elastic modulus (Young&#39;s modulus) is, of <br/>\ncourse, the ratio of the stress to the strain, not the reverse as I <br/>\nerroneously said before.  If you maintain the units, any error <br/>\nbecomes obvious.  That is why physicists rarely have a problem, <br/>\nwhereas engineers tend to get into trouble, crashing space probes <br/>\ninto planets and whatnot.  ;o)<br/>\n<br/>\nNC</div>",

The most common theory as to why there is such a high incidence of<br/>\nshintetsu showing in Hizen swords is that they were economizing in the<br/>\nproduction process, ie, reducing costs by using less of the outer skin<br/>\nmaterial which requires more folding and hence is more expensive. I have<br/>\nnever found that to be a very good answer as they were, after all,<br/>\npatronized by a major Daimyo and Hizen, as a major trading center, both<br/>\nas<br/>\nan entrepot and as a ceramic producer, and large koku domain, could<br/>\nhardly<br/>\nhave been poor. I have no basis whatsoever for this but I wonder if the<br/>\nanswer might lie in their choice to make blades with a relatively<br/>\nlarger,<br/>\nin a cross section sense, core steel. That would make the blade more<br/>\nflexible. Do any of you who are up on the construction part of swords<br/>\nfind<br/>\nthis makes sense from a functional point of view? <br/>\nIt is interesting to note that in the Chicago display of Rai blades last<br/>\nyear, from which Hizen took its model, there was vertually no shintetsu<br/>\nto<br/>\nbe seen! <br/>\nCheers.<br/>\n<br/>\nArnold Frenzel<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:afrenzel@...\">afrenzel@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Wed, 30 Apr 2003, Matthew E.

            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1952447937\">Hi. The most common theory as to why there is such a high incidence of<br/>\nshintetsu showing in Hizen swords is that they were economizing in the<br/>\nproduction process, ie, reducing costs by using less of the outer skin<br/>\nmaterial which requires more folding and hence is more expensive. I have<br/>\nnever found that to be a very good answer as they were, after all,<br/>\npatronized by a major Daimyo and Hizen, as a major trading center, both as<br/>\nan entrepot and as a ceramic producer, and large koku domain, could hardly<br/>\nhave been poor. I have no basis whatsoever for this but I wonder if the<br/>\nanswer might lie in their choice to make blades with a relatively larger,<br/>\nin a cross section sense, core steel. That would make the blade more<br/>\nflexible. Do any of you who are up on the construction part of swords find<br/>\nthis makes sense from a functional point of view? <br/>\n It is interesting to note that in the Chicago display of Rai blades last<br/>\nyear, from which Hizen took its model, there was vertually no shintetsu to<br/>\nbe seen! <br/>\n Cheers.<br/>\n<br/>\nArnold Frenzel<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:afrenzel@...\">afrenzel@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Wed, 30 Apr 2003, Matthew E.
