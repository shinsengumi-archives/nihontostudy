I discovered that all of my email from both Yahoo chat groups (nihonto and nihontostudy) are being blocked!  My provider just telephoned to say that both of these groups are &quot;blacklisted&quot; on at least three nationwide IP lists (?..forget the correct terminology here...).  I have no idea why, but that is what I&#39;m being told.  He is hopefully &quot;fixing&quot; the problem by placing both groups on a &quot;white list&quot; which overrides the &quot;black list.&quot;  Let&#39;s hope it works.  I&#39;ll know only when my mail once again begins to arrive.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMeanwhile, if anyone wishes to contact me via a list, try Chris Bowen&#39;s list.  That is coming through okay.  Again, just passing this on for what it&#39;s worth.<br/>\n<br/>\nRon<br/>\nSTL<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
