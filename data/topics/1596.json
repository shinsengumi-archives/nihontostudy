I think it is because the original hole was thought too low for Edo<br/>\nperiod mounts. I think you would need to do a comparison of Tensho period<br/>\nshort sword mounts and later Edo period mounts to confirm that. I might add<br/>\nthat it is a common complaint among collectors of Seki works in Japan, and<br/>\nalso adds to the problem of identifying the distinctions among the<br/>\ngenerations if you can&#39;t fully read the kane character. There does not seem<br/>\nto be the same problem with katana.

Looking at Nihonto&#39;s site today I noticed Fred has a Kanemasu<br/>\ntanto for sale. I own two such tanto by Kanemasu, one having been featured<br/>\nas &quot;Tanto of the Month&quot; in Benson&#39;s Bushido publication years ago. <br/>\n<br/>\nI find it quite curious that all of the Kanemasu tanto I&#39;ve seen--my own and<br/>\nothers illustrated--seem to have two mekugi-ana.

It makes me<br/>\nwonder if this was a happenchance of remounting or if perhaps it was some<br/>\nsort of &quot;trademark&quot; of this smith.
