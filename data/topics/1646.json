I felt I got quite a bit for the <br/>\n  money.  Though the blade is of mill steel, it shows fine wisps of <br/>\n  hada (sunagashi).  I have read articles by guys in the know who <br/>\n  tested some blades, unfortunately don&#39;t remember where, so you&#39;ll <br/>\n  have to do a web search to dig them out.  I think I remember the Chen <br/>\n  and the United Cutlery swords got good marks in the cheapie <br/>\n  category.  For sure, stay away from the cheap stainless steel blades; <br/>\n  they can be brittle and fracture on impact, launching the free end to <br/>\n  who-knows-where.  The drawbacks that I can relate re the Chen <br/>\n  Practical Katana include the following.  1. The tsuka is non-<br/>\n  removable (in fact, the nakago has a kink in it to help insure it <br/>\n  stays inside the tsuka); the tsuka must be destroyed to get it off <br/>\n  the blade, and any replacement tsuka may not be removed by just <br/>\n  sliding it off, due to the nakago kink.  2. The shape of the blade is <br/>\n  actually fairly good in that it is reasonably appropriate, regular <br/>\n  and lacking in waves/ripples; however, it is &quot;flat polished&quot;, i.e., <br/>\n  little or no niku (clamshell curve from the shinogi to the ha).  <br/>\n  Thus, it should cut rather well, but be more susceptible to chipping <br/>\n  than it would if more traditionally shaped.  Even with these <br/>\n  reservations, I feel the Chen katana is a good deal for the money, <br/>\n  particularly if you can get a good discount on Ebay.
