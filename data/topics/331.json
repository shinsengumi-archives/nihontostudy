I put up a photo of Jomon stone points that I had handy at<br/>\n<br/>\n <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://tinyurl.com/dk7y\">http://tinyurl.com/dk7y</a> for comparison.  <br/>\n<br/>\nA friend in Japan has a Kofun jidai gilt yamagane Hoju tsuba in his collection that has had a kozuka ana added and some very wide sekigane installed to modify the ovoid &quot;nakago&quot; ana for mounting on a conventional koshirae.  I&#39;d speculate that it was unearthed sometime during the Edo period, was recognized as a sword guard and modified for use on a then contemporary wakizashi koshirae.  The kozuka ana and sekigane are definitely not original, and wouldn&#39;t have been added if the guard was only kept as a curiosity, it must have been worn.  After seeing your tsuka, I wonder what the rest of the fittings on that sword were like.  <br/>\n<br/>\nJim<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Friends,<br/>\n        The last time I tried to do this, a number of people got on my case,<br/>\n  but allow me to call the list&#39;s attention to an item I recently bought on<br/>\n  eBay. I&#39;m not gloating or bragging - well I am, but collectors are allowed<br/>\n  to do that. My real goal in this posting is to discuss what I think is a<br/>\n  very interesting sword fitting.<br/>\n        It is still to be seen as item 2176985428 on the world&#39;s marketplace.<br/>\n  Please take a look.<br/>\n        One of my research interests is the history of Japanese archeological<br/>\n  research. Usually, archeology is presented as a subject that was introduced<br/>\n  to Japan in the early Meiji period by Edward Morse. Japan is littered with<br/>\n  old sites, tho, so there must have been an older interest in ancient stuff.<br/>\n  Of course there was and I have found evidence of  a fair amount of Edo<br/>\n  period interest in stuff we now see as prehistoric. There were collectors<br/>\n  and collectors&#39; groups, and named types. I think there were as well some<br/>\n  pretty good understandings that objects like stone artifacts reflected old<br/>\n  ways of doing things. And in that light, I find this tsuka very<br/>\n  interesting.<br/>\n        The &quot;menuki&quot; on this tsuka are absolutely Jomon era arrow points. In<br/>\n  fact, Jomon points are pretty uniform for thousands of years (unlike the<br/>\n  case in North America, for example) so it is hard to know the specific age<br/>\n  of these two artifacts. But that is what they are. Finding them tied into<br/>\n  Edo period fittings is proof that folks at that time were picking ancient<br/>\n  objects up, looking at them, and finding them interesting. I think it also<br/>\n  suggests that somebody must have figured out that these two things were<br/>\n  some manner of weapon or at least something that went with a sword.<br/>\n        Now I have not seen the tsuka - only the images - but based on them<br/>\n  I see this as a pretty ordinary piece of koshirae - lacquered tsuka-ito,<br/>\n  but shark skin rather than same, and pretty rustic iron fuchi-kashira. It<br/>\n  seems to be a katana size so it would be a real samurai&#39;s sword, but I see<br/>\n  it as a &quot;country piece.&quot;  Archaeological sites are where you find them, but<br/>\n  I could certainly believe that a rural samurai, like a country<br/>\n  administrator or a local land owner, could acquire stone points and find<br/>\n  them interesting enough to use in this way. Do you all agree?<br/>\n        Finally, let me ask the list if anyone out there has ever seen any<br/>\n  other use of archeological objects on or with  swords or other Edo period<br/>\n  stuff<br/>\n        Thanks for listening.<br/>\n  Peter Bleed<br/>\n                                                                              <br/>\n        <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
