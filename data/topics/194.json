            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1894982561\">Hi everyone!<br/>\nI once had a rather nice later Muromachi Bizen katana that had the<br/>\nnakago and the mei ground down to bright metal..in fact, the end of<br/>\nthe nakago was ground almost to a point and a threaded post was<br/>\nwelded on so this blade could be mounted in one of those Meiji/Taisho<br/>\nperiod D guard mounts.  Obviously the &#39;armorer&#39; who mounted the sword<br/>\nknew nothing about swords, nor cared!  I believe that, like in the US<br/>\nduring the war, people donated swords to the government (in the US it<br/>\nwas fighting knives) for issue to new officers.  I don&#39;t believe that<br/>\nevery &#39;ancestral&#39; blade in a Gunto or Kaigunto mount was mounted by<br/>\nthe family of an officer with a &#39;family&#39; blade.  When swords were<br/>\nneeded, many were donated to the cause; be it the invasion of China<br/>\nand Manchuria or WW2.  That one sword told me that the armories were<br/>\nmerely making sharp shiny things for the military and that is as far<br/>\nas their knowledge went.  This is speculation, of course, but it<br/>\nmakes sense to me especially with some of the swords I have seen.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDear Friends,<br/>\nAt the risk of making my first contribution to this list argumentative, I<br/>\nmust respectfully disagree with Swordnsig.<br/>\nOver the years I have owned a couple of blades that were modified in Meiji<br/>\ntimes to accommodate gunto koshirae of the era. They have always stuck me<br/>\nas very well-crafted and legitimate - if unfortunate - adjustments to<br/>\nchanges in sword technology. Whether equipped with a thread bolts of simply<br/>\nbent to fit a kyu-gunto tsuka, the work of making these adjustments is<br/>\nalways very carefully done so that handle is snug and graceful. Notice that<br/>\nthe work is always done to allow a habaki to be installed and removed as<br/>\nnecessary. Furthermore, the reworking on nakago is a well established part<br/>\nof the nipponto traditions. Think of all the osuriage swords we see and<br/>\nnakago with the remnants of wonderful old hori! Finally, I doubt that this<br/>\nwork was done in &quot;armories.&quot; I assume instead that it was done by smiths<br/>\neager for the work and to please their patrons. In any case, it seems<br/>\nentirely wrong to consider the swords that won the Wars again the Chinese<br/>\nand the Russians as &quot;merely ..sharp shiny things.&quot; They were well designed,<br/>\nexcellent weapons. Not necessarily to traditional tastes, but cutters none<br/>\nthe less!<br/>\nPeter Bleed</div>",
