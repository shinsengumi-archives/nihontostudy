            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-796164278\">Matthew and Folk -<br/>\n<br/>\nDrilling is self-explanatory.  A hole is drilled with a tool steel <br/>\nbit.  In punching, the smith heats up the section of the nakago to <br/>\nred heat, and using a round steel punch, hammers a deep dimple on one <br/>\nside.  He then turns the blade over and centers the punch over the <br/>\ndimple on the other side, and whacks it with a hammer.  Done <br/>\ncorrectly, a small, round coin is ejected, and the hole is complete.  <br/>\nFresh punched holes will show rounded shoulders, and may show in the <br/>\ninterior the section where the little coin broke off.  Drilled holes <br/>\nwill have sharp, square shoulders, and uniform walls, likely showing <br/>\nspiral marks on the sides.  I believe most of the WWII traditional <br/>\nnihonto had punched ana, but don&#39;t know what percentage of non-<br/>\ntraditional gunto had drilled ana.<br/>\n<br/>\nNC<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com\">nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Matthew E.
