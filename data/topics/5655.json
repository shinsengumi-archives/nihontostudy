Please see my earlier posting for details and<br/>\nlimitations on consigned books.<br/>\n<br/>\nNo, I didn&#39;t win the lottery, no rich uncle died. It just seems that<br/>\ninterest has tapered off. I do want to thank all of you who have been<br/>\nsupportive (and got some great deals!)<br/>\n<br/>\nAs stated before, I have no other job than being a bookseller, and I will<br/>\ncontinue to do that, and offer specials on select books, and the occasional<br/>\nupdate when I list something that I think is worth noting for collectors, if<br/>\nonly for information purposes. I will describe my stock as accurately as<br/>\npossible, price fairly, and ship promptly packed for safe transit.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy last collection of tsuba is still for sale on Boris Markhasin&#39;s website,<br/>\n[url]www.yamabushiantiques.com[/url], on the consignment page. The prices<br/>\nshown were recently reduced from those that were listed in 2009.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\n<br/>\nCraig<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nCraig Harris<br/>\nBridge of Dreams, LLC<br/>\nBooks from and about Asia<br/>\nwww.bridgeofdreams.com<br/>\nMember, IOBA, Independent Online Booksellers Association<br/>\nMember, MWABA, Midwest Antiquarian Booksellers Association<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
