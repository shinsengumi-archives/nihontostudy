            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1172091870\">Dear Jim,<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you for the reply.<br/>\n   I have a nice tsuba signed (Niwa) Norisuke on the<br/>\nfront and Norishige (early sig. of Iwata Norisuke) on<br/>\nthe back. It is a pleasant design of a pine tree. A<br/>\ndesign I like alot.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was away in Connecticut for a while and did not have<br/>\naccess to my books. Hitting the Owari to Mikawa no<br/>\nTanko (aka the big blue Owari book), I noted a similar<br/>\none signed and dated 1851 by Norisuke the 1st. It is<br/>\nusually the last one listed in any book, as I believe<br/>\nit is the latest date at which he was known to have<br/>\nmade a tsuba.<br/>\n<br/>\nGiven that these guys were fairly prolific:<br/>\n   I expected to eventually find some other joint<br/>\nworks. A list member even loaned me the Norisuke book.<br/>\nThere are no joint works in there or any other<br/>\nreference I have opened.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo me the workmanship of the tsuba looks like that of<br/>\nIwata Norisuke. But the signature on the front is Niwa<br/>\nNorisuke.<br/>\n   So maybe Iwata Norisuke made it and his teacher<br/>\nsigned it- or a fun but much less likely possibility<br/>\n(remember that these are master forgers) Iwata<br/>\nNorisuke forged his teacher&#39;s signature? Unlikely, but<br/>\ngiven the marked similarity of their signatures- fun<br/>\nto imagine.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny recommendations who would be best in Japan to ask<br/>\nabout this tsuba?<br/>\n<br/>\nCurran<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- Jim Gilbert &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jggilbert@...\">jggilbert@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Curran,<br/>\n&gt; I haven&#39;t seen one illustrated or in person. <br/>\n&gt; Jointly signed works are very uncommon in fittings. <br/>\n&gt; Most examples that I can think of are where the<br/>\n&gt; plate was prepared by one person and the decoration<br/>\n&gt; applied by another.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  It&#39;d be an interesting study to assemble a group<br/>\n&gt; (even photos) of jointly signed pieces of any type.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Jim<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.jimgilbertphoto.com/\">http://www.jimgilbertphoto.com/</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Dear Lists,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve been reading and researching Norisuke I &<br/>\n&gt; Norisuke II for a while.
