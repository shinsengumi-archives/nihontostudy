            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-174513705\">Hi Paul,<br/>\n<br/>\nNobody seems interested in answering this, so I might as well put my foot<br/>\ninto it. The school, as you note, is conservative, which is probably due to<br/>\ntheir Yamato origins, another very conservative place. I read the school<br/>\nname as Kongobyoe, which is the pronunciation typically heard in Japan,<br/>\nalthough there seems to be an alternative to just about every possible<br/>\nreading for a name. The blades are seen as &quot;waki-mono&quot; or outside the main<br/>\nschools. There has long been a tendency to look down on &quot;waki-mono&quot; with<br/>\nsome exceptions. Part of the problem is that with this school and others<br/>\nsuch as the Kanabo school, the Bungo Takada school, the Kai Mihara school,<br/>\nthey produced a lot of kazu-uchi, which were obviously popular because they<br/>\nhave been so well used -- or used up. There are many who think that this is<br/>\nall these schools produced, which like all generalizations, doesn&#39;t hold<br/>\ntrue for a small, but important body of very good work. Thus, you should<br/>\nlook at the individual blade for the quality it possesses and not the<br/>\n&quot;truths&quot; distributed by opinion makers. The nice thing about Kongobyoe and<br/>\nthe other schools I have mentioned, is that due to these kinds of<br/>\nprejudices, their prices remain affordable even in Japan. Hope this fogs the<br/>\nissue up sufficiently.<br/>\n<br/>\nGordon<br/>\n  -----Original Message-----<br/>\n  From: paul bowman [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bowman1955@...\">bowman1955@...</a>]<br/>\n  Sent: Tuesday, June 17, 2003 7:35 PM<br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com\">nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n  Subject: [nihontostudy] kongo-bei<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Hi All,<br/>\n  this is a first message to the group so I am hoping I havent been beaten<br/>\nby technology.<br/>\n  having seen Carys beautifully mounted Kongo-bei katana I was wondering<br/>\nwhat the current view/ opinion of this school was.
