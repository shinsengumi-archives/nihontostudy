They turned up in the end after a slow surface mail journey (my<br/>\nrequest).  It&#39;s a long story but in short I would give Don the benefit of the<br/>\ndoubt and give him every chance to remedy whatever situation has occurred<br/>\noutside his control.<br/>\n<br/>\nBest regards,<br/>\n<br/>\nBarry Thomas<br/>\n(Melbourne, Australia)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\nFrom: &quot;sigp210&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sigp210@...\">sigp210@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com\">nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, September 14, 2005 4:28 AM<br/>\nSubject: [nihontostudy] Don Myrna of Gaijin&#39;s Guide Videos<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nApologies for bringing this here, but I was wondering if anyone has<br/>\nany contact details besides the website email for Don Myrna of the<br/>\nGaijin&#39;s Guide series of videos?<br/>\nA friend ordered the videos from him way back in February, and they<br/>\nnever arrived.
