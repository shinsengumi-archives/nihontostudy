Or in all cases?)<br/>\n<br/>\nGiven that you might destroy your poorly made sword, and a poorly made<br/>\nsword is even less likely to survive the process, I would think you&#39;d<br/>\njust heat the whole thing, quench, sharpen, and toss in the bundle.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt doesn&#39;t take that long to heat harden the whole thing, plus will not<br/>\ndestroy the sword.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the signature stuff... Bishu = worse than Bizen I understand to apply<br/>\nonly to Sue Bizen swords. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy *guess* would be that the amount of effort going into cutting the mei<br/>\nindicates the care taken... Bishu Osafune Sukesada/Kiyomitsu is easier<br/>\nto carve than Bizen Kuni Osafune Ju Sukesada/Kiyomitsu.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs well as no date...<br/>\n<br/>\nBut for these swords that seem to have reasonably good construction, are<br/>\nsigned Bishu Osafune XX, and have a hamon showing activity... is it fair<br/>\nto call those mass produced swords?<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter all, the workmanship is showing things not associated with mass<br/>\nproduction. It&#39;s only the signature that is saying something. So is it a<br/>\n&quot;bad&quot; rule of thumb to judge these exclusively based on signature?<br/>\n<br/>\nOr are there just different levels to the mass-production. Maybe less<br/>\nskilled people/apprentices are given the work of making the Bishu<br/>\nOsafune stuff while the talented guys are taking their time with the<br/>\nbetter items?<br/>\n<br/>\n- darcy</div>",

The tanto is <br/>\nsigned Bishu Osafune Kiyo(mitsu?) and Eiroku jyu ichi (nen?) (?) <br/>\ngatsu hi (1568).  Q #1:  Is it indeed kazu uchimono?  Seems so, given <br/>\nthe Bishu vs. Bizen mei, the date, plus it also has a lot of loose <br/>\nhada and forging ware.  Q #2:  Any idea as to which Kiyomitsu made <br/>\nit?  Q #3:  Is it common for kazu uchimono of this area and time to <br/>\nhave loads of utsuri and nijuba/sanjuba as does this example?  That <br/>\nis, while the forging was apparently quick and dirty, it appears that <br/>\nthis blade got the full professional tempering treatment.  Possibly <br/>\nthe smiths were so used to doing the tempering correctly that they <br/>\njust did it as a matter of course, even for bundled blades?
