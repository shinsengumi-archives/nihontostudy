Fred was leading and Jeff Miller was at <br/>\n&gt; the end and I was in the middle.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; First Fred picked up a sword looked at it and bought it.It was a great <br/>\n&gt; koto 28+ inch sword with some rust problems.He felt that he would be <br/>\n&gt; able to double his money, and did on Sunday.A little bit later, Jeff <br/>\n&gt; Miller picked up a blade that I had just set down - He did ask if I was <br/>\n&gt; done -looked at it, bought it and then walked across the room and sold <br/>\n&gt; it for a large profit.By this time I was wondering what was going on so <br/>\n&gt; I stepped around Fred and was leading the group.This time I was going to <br/>\n&gt; find the treasure!!!You are right. Very shortly, on swords I had passed <br/>\n&gt; by, both Fred and Jeff bought blades.After I whined a little bit, they <br/>\n&gt; did help me find a blade to add to my collection.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; At another show I remember Fred buying a sword. That evening he took the <br/>\n&gt; blade to his room and by the next day had cleaned up the blade and <br/>\n&gt; mountings so that he was able to sell at a profit.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; One show we decided to make the drive together. Coming home was great.We <br/>\n&gt; both had bought swords and when we were not driving, we were cleaning, <br/>\n&gt; or working on researching the smiths, talking about what made up the <br/>\n&gt; sword and why it was an example of that school.The trips will be much <br/>\n&gt; longer now.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; He will be missed.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Later<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; david<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -- <br/>\n&gt; -- <br/>\n&gt; David McDonald Collector of Japanese Swords and Old Iron<br/>\n&gt; PO Box 265 WEB page - <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.montanairon.com\">http://www.montanairon.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Sidney MT 59270 email - <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jswords@...\">jswords@...</a><br/>\n&gt; 406-482-3243 evenings I do tsukamaki (wrapping of sword hilts)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Owner of White IH Cub& Super A Farmall, IH 100& 130, 140, AC G<br/>\n&gt; McD type M, Monitor, Frost King and other stationary engines.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>",
