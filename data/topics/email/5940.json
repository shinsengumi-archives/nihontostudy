Fred was leading and Jeff Miller was at <br/>\n  the end and I was in the middle.<br/>\n<br/>\n  First Fred picked up a sword looked at it and bought it.It was a great <br/>\n  koto 28+ inch sword with some rust problems.He felt that he would be <br/>\n  able to double his money, and did on Sunday.A little bit later, Jeff <br/>\n  Miller picked up a blade that I had just set down - He did ask if I was <br/>\n  done -looked at it, bought it and then walked across the room and sold <br/>\n  it for a large profit.By this time I was wondering what was going on so <br/>\n  I stepped around Fred and was leading the group.This time I was going to <br/>\n  find the treasure!!!You are right. Very shortly, on swords I had passed <br/>\n  by, both Fred and Jeff bought blades.After I whined a little bit, they <br/>\n  did help me find a blade to add to my collection.<br/>\n<br/>\n  At another show I remember Fred buying a sword. That evening he took the <br/>\n  blade to his room and by the next day had cleaned up the blade and <br/>\n  mountings so that he was able to sell at a profit.<br/>\n<br/>\n  One show we decided to make the drive together. Coming home was great.We <br/>\n  both had bought swords and when we were not driving, we were cleaning, <br/>\n  or working on researching the smiths, talking about what made up the <br/>\n  sword and why it was an example of that school.The trips will be much <br/>\n  longer now.<br/>\n<br/>\n  He will be missed.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Later<br/>\n<br/>\n  david<br/>\n<br/>\n  -- <br/>\n  -- <br/>\n  David McDonald Collector of Japanese Swords and Old Iron<br/>\n  PO Box 265 WEB page - <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.montanairon.com\">http://www.montanairon.com</a><br/>\n  Sidney MT 59270 email - <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jswords@...\">jswords@...</a><br/>\n  406-482-3243 evenings I do tsukamaki (wrapping of sword hilts)<br/>\n<br/>\n  Owner of White IH Cub& Super A Farmall, IH 100& 130, 140, AC G<br/>\n  McD type M, Monitor, Frost King and other stationary engines.<br/>\n<br/>\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>",
