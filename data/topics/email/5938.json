    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-544521168\">Dear All<br/>\n<br/>\nA long time collector of Japanese swords and one who attended many of <br/>\nthe sword shows, Fred LeMond of Cheyenne (Horse Creek, Wyoming) passed <br/>\naway April 22, 2013.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have known Fred for over 30 years and he help me understand Japanese <br/>\nswords and learn how to tell the differences between the five schools of <br/>\nswordmaking.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe was always there to help me learn and I remember back in the 1980&#39;s <br/>\nwalking the San Franciso show. Fred was leading and Jeff Miller was at <br/>\nthe end and I was in the middle.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst Fred picked up a sword looked at it and bought it.It was a great <br/>\nkoto 28+ inch sword with some rust problems.He felt that he would be <br/>\nable to double his money, and did on Sunday.A little bit later, Jeff <br/>\nMiller picked up a blade that I had just set down - He did ask if I was <br/>\ndone -looked at it, bought it and then walked across the room and sold <br/>\nit for a large profit.By this time I was wondering what was going on so <br/>\nI stepped around Fred and was leading the group.This time I was going to <br/>\nfind the treasure!!!You are right. Very shortly, on swords I had passed <br/>\nby, both Fred and Jeff bought blades.After I whined a little bit, they <br/>\ndid help me find a blade to add to my collection.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt another show I remember Fred buying a sword. That evening he took the <br/>\nblade to his room and by the next day had cleaned up the blade and <br/>\nmountings so that he was able to sell at a profit.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne show we decided to make the drive together. Coming home was great.We <br/>\nboth had bought swords and when we were not driving, we were cleaning, <br/>\nor working on researching the smiths, talking about what made up the <br/>\nsword and why it was an example of that school.The trips will be much <br/>\nlonger now.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe will be missed.<br/>\n<br/>\nLater<br/>\n<br/>\ndavid<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n-- <br/>\nDavid McDonald            Collector of Japanese Swords and Old Iron<br/>\nPO Box 265                      WEB page - <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.montanairon.com\">http://www.montanairon.com</a><br/>\nSidney MT  59270                email - <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jswords@...\">jswords@...</a><br/>\n406-482-3243  evenings     I do tsukamaki (wrapping of sword hilts)<br/>\n<br/>\nOwner of White IH Cub&  Super A Farmall, IH 100&  130, 140, AC G<br/>\nMcD type M, Monitor, Frost King and other stationary engines.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
