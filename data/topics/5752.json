Pieces I  <br/>\nhave seen are typically poor quality swords, with poor quality  <br/>\nfittings very roughly made and usually lacquer that seems to have been  <br/>\na few coats shy of a full job.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome but not all are clearly Satsuma koshirae which is all I think  <br/>\nthese things are, just poor quality Satsuma koshirae. Hence my  <br/>\nquestion - has anyone seen reference to these in Japanese sources?  <br/>\nWhat are they called in Japanese and what is the rationale for  <br/>\nassigning these to the rebellion specifically?<br/>\n<br/>\n-t<br/>\nTom Helm<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:toryu@...\">toryu@...</a><br/>\n&quot;Moriamur, et in media arma ruamus&quot;<br/>\n- Vergil</div>",
