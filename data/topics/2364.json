I am about to buy swords from him and did not at all feel anything wrong in our correspondance, only that he seems good and straight as you describe him. But I have been cheeted awful before using the net, even though I had copy of passport and drivers license. I am also new in collecting and buying on the net. Therefore I am very carefully to ask peoble with the same interest whether a seller is trustfully or not. I am very anxious to learn what I can from others but do not like to spend money for a sword and then donÂ´t get it. I wish to be aware about who are the bad guys and who are the good ones. .<br/>\n<br/>\nHi Steve<br/>\nThankyou so much for the link. Will love to investigate all the beautyful photos further.<br/>\n<br/>\nAppreciate your help<br/>\nAll the best<br/>\nAllan<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Michael Vinehout <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com\">nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Wednesday, October 27, 2004 4:42 PM<br/>\n  Subject: RE: [nihontostudy] Tokugawa Daisho<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Hi Allan, I know Bill Rannow and have bought several swords from him.
