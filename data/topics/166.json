He supports this with ubu-ana in early<br/>\ntsuba. Of course, you have to accept that his dating of undated,<br/>\nundocumented tsuba are as early as Heian and Kamakura periods. It has<br/>\nrecently become fashionable to make all of Sasano&#39;s dates much later<br/>\n(younger?). I also have serious doubts about kogai being used for marking or<br/>\ncarrying heads. I don&#39;t think they would stand up to that kind of abuse.<br/>\nPicking ears and combing hair, certainly. Nonetheless, there certainly are<br/>\ntsuba, and tsuba that are clearly early -- Nambokucho to be conservative --<br/>\nthat have ubu kozuka ana as well as ubu kogai ana. <br/>\n<br/>\nGordon<br/>\n----------<br/>\nFrom: tom helm &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junkmail@...\">junkmail@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com\">nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [nihontostudy] kogai on katana<br/>\nDate: Sun, 4 May 2003 10:43:39 -0700<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Hey guys,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I was just curious - Anybody have any idea why momoyama era katana<br/>\n&gt;sometimes got only a kogai?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>      I don&#39;t KNOW but I am always full of theories...<br/>\nThink of the uses for these two, a kogai was used to dress the hair <br/>\nfrom way back, there is also evidence it was used to carry captured <br/>\nheads.
