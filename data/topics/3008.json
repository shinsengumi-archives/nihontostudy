Put a couple out on display ( loose or in a large glass display cabinet?) and keep the rest in the vault? <br/>\n<br/>\nDo you display the papers with the sword? <br/>\n<br/>\nAre there others who display lots of swords and tsuba? How do people do this? I don&#39;t like the idea of a sword rack on the wall where people can just take the swords off. I am thinking more along the lines of a display behind glass or perspex.<br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps other members could post pictures of how they have their swords display? Alternatively email them to me at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:matthewhoyle@...\">matthewhoyle@...</a> <br/>\n<br/>\nRegards, Matthew<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
