The ones I have seen have either a Kogai Hitsu-ana or Kozuka Hitsu-ana on one side and a Hitsu-ana that is part of the shape of the overall design for the opposing Hitsu-ana or, they have the standard configuration or both Kozuka Hitsu-ana in a more rounded form.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, the seppa dai looks a little uniform to me and may be right for one of the later works but not the early stuff. <br/>\n<br/>\nI was wondering if this may be a Hayashi guard ???.<br/>\n<br/>\ncheers all<br/>\n<br/>\nRich<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
