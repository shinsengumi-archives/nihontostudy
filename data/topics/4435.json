Still, when the front desk tells you not to submit your<br/>\n&gt; &gt; numbered and stamped gunto and you do anyway, I guess there is not<br/>\n&gt; &gt; much that can be done. We are trying to have a traveling shinsa  <br/>\n&gt; every<br/>\n&gt; &gt; year with Chicago up next. I hope we can continue to see fewer<br/>\n&gt; &gt; rejections. Oh, the show also seems to have been well attended on<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Saturday. I gave a short talk similar to the one in San Francisco,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and it was a pretty good turn out for a one off event.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Gordon<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I was not able to make it for the show and had two swords I was  <br/>\n&gt; going to<br/>\n&gt; submit for shinsa. One already had NBTHK attribution at Juyo level and<br/>\n&gt; as it was a mumei, I was interested in alternate attributions.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; As I didn&#39;t make it, neither were submitted.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Does the NTHK accept such blades? I was told somewhat vaguely that  <br/>\n&gt; they<br/>\n&gt; may not so I would like to know if I should bother submitting things<br/>\n&gt; like this in the future?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; - darcy<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -- <br/>\n&gt; NOTICE: This email is private communication for the named recipients<br/>\n&gt; only.
