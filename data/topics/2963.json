We hate to say to try something that&#39;s not going to give you the correct results. One of the best results I&#39;ve ever had was when a friend of mine would offer to wear a tsuba around his neck for awhile. He worked in a gym and his body sweat (ugh) worked wonders on some tsuba and didn&#39;t work on others (depending on the steel). Personally, I&#39;ve never tried to used one of the traditional formula that can be found. <br/>\n<br/>\nAncient coins...sounds interesting! <br/>\n<br/>\nRon<br/>\nSTL<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Richard Turner <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com\">nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Saturday, May 14, 2005 6:17 PM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [nihontostudy] Re:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Hi Kim, I don&#39;t think anyone will answer that, an inherently dangerous <br/>\n  question that could only lead to tears.
