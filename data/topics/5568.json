As the saying goes, good reference books don&#39;t cost, they<br/>\npay.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve decided to extend my sale through next Wednesday. I was out of<br/>\ntown on three separate short trips last week to tour universities with<br/>\nmy son, and did not get nearly as much new material uploaded as I had<br/>\nplanned to. Once again, it&#39;s a 33% discount on all sales of books from<br/>\nmy website, shipping at cost.<br/>\n<br/>\nI will be adding newly found books to the website, and continuing to<br/>\npack up for the Chicago Show, where I will offer a slightly less<br/>\nattractive discount since as an Illinois business making sales in<br/>\nIllinois I have to deal with a 10% sales tax.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs long as you are comfortable with orders placed near the end of the<br/>\nsale waiting until after the show to ship, order away!<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m very pleased with the results, and I&#39;m glad to have made the<br/>\nacquaintance of many of you whom I did not know before.<br/>\n<br/>\nCraig<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.bridgeofdreams.com\">http://www.bridgeofdreams.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nCraig Harris<br/>\nBridge of Dreams, LLC<br/>\nBooks from and about Asia<br/>\nwww.bridgeofdreams.com</div>",
