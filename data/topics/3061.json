Put another way, is it <br/>\nreasonable to assume that all kodogu adjudged, for example, as <br/>\nTokubetsu Hozon might be of roughly the same quality,irrespective of <br/>\nthe maker, or might such an artefact by an artist considered as Meijin <br/>\npossibly be superior to one, graded as Tokubetsu Kicho, by a lesser <br/>\nartist?<br/>\n<br/>\nHave I made clear that rather complicated question?<br/>\n<br/>\nRegards, JPL.</div>",
