            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-356350168\">Rich,<br/>\nI&#39;ll be interested to hear how yours turns out.  The one I made has continued to dry and is now pretty difficult to flex.  Mine is a three layer, which is the simplest construction I&#39;ve seen.  Most are 4 or 5 layer and I&#39;ve seen one six layer guard.  I think that crossing the grain makes sense.  I couldn&#39;t detect a  consistent grain in the rawhide I used, so I don&#39;t know if the layers are optimally arranged. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe lacquered examples I&#39;ve seen didn&#39;t show signs of lacquering between the layers.  Many of the early ones at Oyamazumi have delaminated, so whatever the glue was, it failed at some point over the last 800 years.  Many of those guards show no trace of lacquer at all, while the saya and tsuka of the same koshirae are still intact.  I don&#39;t know if the tsuba were not lacquered originally, or if the lacquer was not as stable on the leather as it is on wood.  Maybe the leather expands and contracts more with changes in temperature and/or humidity causing the lacquer to flake off.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Nanbokucho era nerikawa tsuba were in better shape.  I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s because of lesser age or an improvement in manufacturing technique or something else.<br/>\nJim<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  I think also we forget that dried, lacquered leather can<br/>\n  be as hard a rock and not very flexible. I have a lacquered<br/>\n  leather jingasa that is totally rigid and hard. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Also, perhaps (?) the way the leather is laid down in layers<br/>\n  has something to do with the rigidity and hardness. If<br/>\n  the grain is laid down at 90 degrees in the different<br/>\n  layers, it may (?) make a difference. Also the type of<br/>\n  glue used could effect it although I suspect that rice<br/>\n  glue was what was commonly used. Does lacquer itself<br/>\n  have &quot;glue&quot; properties? Maybe the layers were lacquered<br/>\n  together to greater strength as well as having a lacquer<br/>\n  coat for weather proofing.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Just more thinking/speculating out loud. Interesting<br/>\n  thread. I&#39;ll have to try my hand at making a leather<br/>\n  tsuba too :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n  rich<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",

            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1390825677\">Hello Jim and all,<br/>\n<br/>\nI would expect that warfare or a specific battle would have many different<br/>\n&#39;combat scenario&#39;s&#39; besides what we have read as being typical or proper (by<br/>\nthe book). However, I agree with the thinking that the bow was the primary<br/>\nweapon way back in the Kamakura period. How often did a Samurai on horseback<br/>\nactually use his sword?<br/>\n<br/>\nFor running down a fleeing opponent or getting close with another mounted<br/>\nwarrior, especially one still holding his bow, a light, long, and curved sword<br/>\nis very effective. If you are using a 3 foot long sword from horseback, its<br/>\nweight is a prime factor. With my left hand on the reins, I would want my sword<br/>\nto be light and easy to draw, hold, and use with my right arm and hand. Such a<br/>\nsword enables one to deliver many slashing blows without getting tired. A<br/>\nleather tsuba certainly didn&#39;t add extra weight, or affect the balance of the<br/>\nweapon to any great degree. I would never be aiming for my opponents tsuba or<br/>\nhis helmet bowl if fighting from horseback. I don&#39;t think I would get close to<br/>\nanybody until I used up all my arrows. Perhaps then I would draw my sword.<br/>\nThose fellows on the ground with the long nagamaki&#39;s scare me (and especially<br/>\nmy horse a lot), but if I can get swiftly past the blade, or they turn their<br/>\nbacks on me, watch out, they are most likely dead.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs Dennis Miller often says: &quot;....and I could be wrong about this.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nRichard<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com\">nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com</a> wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nihontostudy-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\">nihontostudy-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; There are 2 messages in this issue.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Topics in this digest:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;       1.

The early warrior chronicles would support<br/>\n&gt; this notion of one on one combat. The sohei (warrior monks) with their long<br/>\n&gt; naginata and nagamaki might have hit a tsuba, but as these warriors were<br/>\n&gt; essentially unmounted, I think they did not typically engage with mounted<br/>\n&gt; warriors. I know that a naginata is good for taking down a horse, but you<br/>\n&gt; have to stand out in the open with a guy who is also armed with a bow to do<br/>\n&gt; that, I would think.<br/>\n&gt; Joining Tom in thinking outloud.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; G<br/>\n&gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; From: tom helm &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junkmail@...\">junkmail@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com\">nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [nihontostudy] unscientific kawa tsuba experiment<br/>\n&gt; Date: Sat, 10 May 2003 17:34:59 -0700<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Jim et al-<br/>\n&gt;       If we accept what we are told about the warfare of the times,<br/>\n&gt; I believe a mounted warrior with a three foot tachi would be hard<br/>\n&gt; pressed to cut another mans tsuba who was also mounted.
