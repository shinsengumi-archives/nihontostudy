Your questions have probably<br/>\nall been answered, but here is my very inexpert opinion.<br/>\n A. This one is easy. In the east Asian scheme of things for those using<br/>\nthe Chinese zodiac, sixty is the full cycle of 12 times 5 and a very<br/>\nimportant year. 61 is merely the first year thereafter, so the launching<br/>\nof a new cycle. To achieve 60 is the occasion for a major birthday<br/>\nparty. <br/>\n B. I don&#39;t know.<br/>\n C. I would think that the edge would go to Hayashi.<br/>\n D. As a rule of thumb, given the way you posed the question, the<br/>\nunsigned would be much less valuable, and were there really two that<br/>\nwere, cet. par., &quot;identical&quot; it would be amazing for the unsigned to<br/>\nhave survived being &quot;up graded.&quot; The distinguished collector RB<br/>\nCaldwell, from Dallas, once said that if one did commission work for an<br/>\nimportant man, e.g., a Daimyo, the convention was not to sign as such<br/>\nwould be disrespectful. I have only seen that in print from him and have<br/>\nno other authority, but if true it might explain why some super pieces<br/>\nare unsigned.<br/>\n E. I would think that in the arts a man&#39;s high point would be in<br/>\nmid-life, particularly if he is involved in much creativity. If it is<br/>\njust a matter of doing the same thing over and over, perhaps the<br/>\nrichness of experience would lead to his skills not seeming to wane. <br/>\n Just my 2 cents worth.<br/>\n Arnold Frenzel<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;Matthew E.

I<br/>\njust<br/>\nhope you did not think I was being rude by not replying earlier.<br/>\nEitherway<br/>\nsorry, and I will try and get a reply in sooner in future, since I<br/>\nreally<br/>\nappreciate the help. Now to the questions:<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile staying on the topic of Higo Tsuba, I have some queries about the<br/>\nHayashi School that was patronized by the Kato, and later the Hosokawa<br/>\nclan.<br/>\nI hope you can help. These tsuba seem to have a very &#39;gentlemanly&#39;<br/>\nappearence about them, which makes them to my mind very attractive<br/>\npieces.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne tsuba I saw described was signed by the second mainline master<br/>\nShigemitsu. The commentary said that he must have been over 61 years in<br/>\nage<br/>\n(since it was signed), as this had special significance in Japan, and in<br/>\nHigo tsuba were only signed after this point in life.<br/>\n<br/>\nA. What is the significance of turning 61 in Japan &<br/>\n<br/>\nB. Why wait untill then to sign guards in Higo? Did other schools in<br/>\nHigo do<br/>\nthis as well, like the Jingo for example? How about entirely different<br/>\nschools outside Higo, did they do this as well or not (doubtful?)<br/>\n<br/>\nC. Last question(s), since I (again!) have never handled or even seen a<br/>\nmainline Hayashi guard in the flesh or come up for sale, can anyone give<br/>\nme<br/>\nan indication as to how this would compare value wise to say a mainline<br/>\nJingo Tsuba? Would this be similar since they are both Higo, or would it<br/>\nbe<br/>\ncomparable to say a mainline Akasaka piece? (I am assuming that the<br/>\npieces<br/>\nare in excellent condition).<br/>\n<br/>\nD. Very last question: If A and B are so important, and we know how<br/>\nimportant it is to have signed works for reference, how does this<br/>\ntranslate<br/>\nvalue wise to say perhaps two identical pieces. One signed and one mumei<br/>\nwith all other things being equal. What difference are we talking value<br/>\nwise<br/>\nhere, if any?<br/>\n<br/>\nE. I promise this is my last question: If tsuba are signed only later in<br/>\nlife (in Higo) might this imply that they are better pieces since the<br/>\nmaker<br/>\nwas more skilled at that time. Would a later identical tsuba be worth<br/>\nmore<br/>\nthan an earlier one by the same man (supposing both were signed and<br/>\ndated<br/>\nfor arguments sake)?<br/>\nIn modern art a discussion has been raging for years about De Koonings<br/>\nwork,<br/>\nsince it was found out that he had gone quiete senile later in life.<br/>\nThis<br/>\nled to a revaluation of his works, the earlier ones being worth more,<br/>\nsince<br/>\nno-one wanted a very expensive painting by someone who was for all<br/>\nintensive<br/>\npurposes as Mad as a Hatter.

            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1449003602\">Matt,<br/>\nThe old Chinese/Japanese system had 12 Junishi (the zodiac animals) and 10 Jikkan that were combined to make a calendar cycle of 60 years.  Reaching 60 years of age is still cause for a celebration since you&#39;ve completed one cycle and are about to start on the second (which you&#39;re not likely to see the end of).  I&#39;ve heard it described as being reborn and starting a second childhood, or just as the start of old age.  In theory it is the point at which one no longer has to deal with dreary adult responsibilities, but I don&#39;t know if that was ever really what happened.  Maybe someone else can provide further insight, particularly on how it was viewed 300 or 400 years ago, but I think that when you&#39;re 61, you&#39;re at a new stage of life as a person and fittings artist and you gain certain prerogatives.<br/>\n<br/>\nI haven&#39;t studied exactly which groups followed this practice.  Generally when a guard is inscribed with the maker&#39;s age, it&#39;s from late in life.  Not all signed or signed and dated guards were done after age 61, although perhaps that was the case in Higo.  It&#39;d be hard to prove the date of all signed but undated or &quot;un-age inscribed&quot; guards to be sure none were done before age 61.<br/>\n<br/>\nHayashi Matashichi is probably the most highly valued maker among the Higo groups, although the first Jingo and Hikozo aren&#39;t far behind.  I don&#39;t think that there are any known signed examples from the first Jingo or Nishigaki Kanshiro.  Some Matashichi guards have kinzogan mei, but these are probably added later.  I have heard some speculation that some could have been done by Matashichi because of the fineness of the inlay, but I don&#39;t think that&#39;s widely accepted.  None of the soft metal first Hikozo guards are signed, but I think there&#39;s one iron one with a signature.  <br/>\n<br/>\nLater generations of the various groups did start signing, but you&#39;ll have to hit the reference books for yourself there.  I think that for people who did sign, if all else is equal a signed guard would be priced higher than an unsigned one.  A middling signed guard probably wouldn&#39;t be priced higher than a very good mumei one by the same maker.  An unsigned Hayashi Matashichi is going to be worth way more than  signed later generation work.  The quality of the later generations&#39; work is generally not close to the founder&#39;s work within a given line.  The Kamiyoshi family, which started later, are the stars of later Higo.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe question about at what age the best work was done is complicated and would be different with each individual (and would also depend upon how much work that individual was actually doing himself).  Senility aside, I find de Kooning&#39;s late work to be pretty wimpy.  Further, I was surprised years ago when I realized that all of his paintings that I though were really great were done between &#39;56 and &#39;60.  That would be what... de Kooning&#39;s mid 50&#39;s?  Guess he couldn&#39;t have signed them if he was working in Higo.<br/>\nJim<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Dear Arnold and Jim,<br/>\n<br/>\n  I would like to thankyou both for answering my question on Jingo tsuba.

Karel Apples early works are worth more than<br/>\nhis later ones as well, albeit for entirely different reasons.<br/>\n<br/>\nRegards, Matthew<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    Z Recruiting Services<br/>\n    &quot;Zurich Toren&quot; Muzenstraat 89<br/>\n    2511 WB Den Haag<br/>\n    T: +31 70 4262273<br/>\n    F: +31 70 4262111<br/>\n    W: zrecruiting.com<br/>\n    E: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:info@...\">info@...</a><br/>\n    Kijk ook op monsterboard.nl en<br/>\n    nationalevacaturebank.nl voor actuele vacatures!<br/>\n<br/>\n    Z Recruiting Services is een handelsnaam van Zèta Partners B.V.<br/>\n    Onze Algemene Voorwaarden zijn gedeponeerd bij KvK Haaglanden.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;arnold frenzel&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:afrenzel@...\">afrenzel@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:token_kenkyu_kai@...\">token_kenkyu_kai@...</a>&gt;; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:matthewhoyle@...\">matthewhoyle@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nCc: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nihonto@yahoogroups.com\">nihonto@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com\">nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Sunday, June 20, 2004 3:31 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [nihontostudy] Jingo Tsuba<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Hi:<br/>\n&gt;  I will take a stab at your very interesting question, one of many that<br/>\n&gt; you seem to come up with. You have provided part of the answer yourself<br/>\n&gt; by saying &quot;rare&quot; though of course that begs the question, why rare?<br/>\n&gt; Jingo tsuba were made in Higo and the work of the first three<br/>\n&gt; generations is considered particularly fine, thereafter as in most lines<br/>\n&gt; following generations could not stop adding gold and silver effects,<br/>\n&gt; becoming too symmetric, adopting features from other groups, etc.<br/>\n&gt;  Higo, being remote from Edo, tended to supply products in the kodogu<br/>\n&gt; area, as with swords, that were somewhat outside the mainstream and they<br/>\n&gt; tended to be somewhat aloof from fashion elsewhere and to maintain that<br/>\n&gt; difference longer than other groups. Their market was more the samurai<br/>\n&gt; and less the merchant than would be true for people supplying the market<br/>\n&gt; in Edo and Osaka. The first three developed naturalistic designs never<br/>\n&gt; seen before or since, and thereby reflected the wabi sabi aesthetic that<br/>\n&gt; was very influential, particularly with the more severe samurai in the<br/>\n&gt; early Edo period. Their designs are very three dimensional, tastefully<br/>\n&gt; accented with gold and silver. Their most complementary counterpart<br/>\n&gt; seems to be found in the work of the Kanayama which, while sukashi, have<br/>\n&gt; the same rustic, subtle and unpretentious character. People also wonder<br/>\n&gt; whey they tend to go for some serious money. Jingo tsuba are instantly<br/>\n&gt; recognizable and fit well with any severe koshirae.<br/>\n&gt;  Just a stab.<br/>\n&gt;  Arnold<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:matthewhoyle@...\">matthewhoyle@...</a> 06/19/04 7:49 PM &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Can anyone explain why Jingo tsuba are so sought after? They always<br/>\n&gt; strike me as being a bit crude and not very interesting, often decorated<br/>\n&gt; with an eagle or other beast that looks, well, kind of retarded. Is<br/>\n&gt; there any specific reason why these pieces have the status they do?<br/>\n&gt; After spending hours looking at pictures of them, I still fail to see<br/>\n&gt; where the (artistic) merit is.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I admit to not having handled any genuine examples personally (since<br/>\n&gt; they are pretty rare), so perhaps these tsuba convey something in the<br/>\n&gt; handling that they do not in the pix?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Matt<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!
