Jim&#39;s lecture and exhibition of Akasaka tsuba is <br/>\ngreaaatttttttttttt ( quoting Tony the tiger, god bless his soul ).The <br/>\nNBTHK oversea branch exhitbition of swords and kantei ( open to all ) <br/>\nis excellent. I did not attempt the kantei as I don&#39;t want to <br/>\nembarrass myself even though i would hit one right on ( the owner <br/>\ntold me  his juyo Ko-Mihara would be there ). Then there&#39;s the <br/>\noshigata lesson, the demonstration of the clay thingie on swords ( <br/>\nhey, i am more of a fitting guy, can&#39;t recall the proper sword term <br/>\nanymore ) etc......<br/>\n<br/>\n Buying and selling................. buyers&#39; market, no question <br/>\nabout it !!<br/>\nIf you carry cash and ready to part with them, great bargains <br/>\neverywhere !!<br/>\nProblem is most are freaking cheap................ or they all drop <br/>\ntheir loads<br/>\nby Hagrid&#39;s ( aka the big guy Mark walberg ) table who has boxes and <br/>\nboxes ( I kid you<br/>\nnot ) of kodogu of the highest calibre ( and the price , though high, <br/>\nis<br/>\nreasonable ).<br/>\nMantis dude, i took a pic of a mantis tsuba from Hagrid&#39;s table just <br/>\nfor<br/>\nyou...............I think the asking price is in the mid 2k.<br/>\nI personally marked my tsuba below retail and managed to sell only <br/>\ntwo tsuba<br/>\nin the higher mid range level and traded away a bunch of low end <br/>\ntsuba for<br/>\nsomethings I can live with. So i consider the show as &quot; slow &quot; but I <br/>\ndo know<br/>\na friend sold a few high end tsuba so the show is good in his <br/>\nprospective.<br/>\n<br/>\nFoods................... the exhibitor&#39;s dinner on Saturday can only <br/>\nbe<br/>\ndescribed as &quot; strange &quot;.............<br/>\nI wonder how our dear friends from Deustchland enjoyed the true &quot; <br/>\nsouthern<br/>\ncooking &quot; that include black eye peas und collar greens !!??<br/>\n<br/>\nJss/us business................ at least 10 new collectors signed up <br/>\nas new<br/>\nmembers at the show all due to the effort of one diector from Canada <br/>\n( in<br/>\nmatters of hours ) !!<br/>\nThe society will be publishing Yoshikawa Sensei&#39;s writing ( <br/>\ntranslated by<br/>\nProf. Gordon Robson ) in 3 volumes all priced at cost !!<br/>\nAn excellent article by our John Berta on Onin tsuba will be <br/>\npublished in<br/>\nthe upcoming journal, on top of that out dear friend from Deustchland <br/>\nHans has<br/>\n, most generously , gave us permission to reprint his article on Yagyu<br/>\ntsuba. Considered what he ate on Saturday night, I wondered how he <br/>\ncan still<br/>\nbe<br/>\nso nice..............may be it&#39;s because I personally asked him ? Or <br/>\nmay be he<br/>\nhad private dinner with carl who told me he had lobster with wine <br/>\nsauce<br/>\nprepared just for him at the hotel ?? Arrrrrrrrrrhhhhhhhhhh, life is<br/>\nsoooooooooooo unfair !!<br/>\n<br/>\nthat&#39;s about all I can think about just now.<br/>\nFor the &quot; serious version &quot; of the event, wait for the Ombudsman&#39;s <br/>\nreport.<br/>\n<br/>\np.s. also learned a new trick from one of the old timer...... when <br/>\nchecking Goto school kozuka, run your finger nail under the &quot; <br/>\npicture &quot; side of the opening......if it catches, not a good sign.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nmilt</div>",
