You have provided part of the answer yourself<br/>\nby saying &quot;rare&quot; though of course that begs the question, why rare?<br/>\nJingo tsuba were made in Higo and the work of the first three<br/>\ngenerations is considered particularly fine, thereafter as in most lines<br/>\nfollowing generations could not stop adding gold and silver effects,<br/>\nbecoming too symmetric, adopting features from other groups, etc.<br/>\n Higo, being remote from Edo, tended to supply products in the kodogu<br/>\narea, as with swords, that were somewhat outside the mainstream and they<br/>\ntended to be somewhat aloof from fashion elsewhere and to maintain that<br/>\ndifference longer than other groups. Their market was more the samurai<br/>\nand less the merchant than would be true for people supplying the market<br/>\nin Edo and Osaka. The first three developed naturalistic designs never<br/>\nseen before or since, and thereby reflected the wabi sabi aesthetic that<br/>\nwas very influential, particularly with the more severe samurai in the<br/>\nearly Edo period. Their designs are very three dimensional, tastefully<br/>\naccented with gold and silver. Their most complementary counterpart<br/>\nseems to be found in the work of the Kanayama which, while sukashi, have<br/>\nthe same rustic, subtle and unpretentious character. People also wonder<br/>\nwhey they tend to go for some serious money. Jingo tsuba are instantly<br/>\nrecognizable and fit well with any severe koshirae.<br/>\n Just a stab.<br/>\n Arnold<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:matthewhoyle@...\">matthewhoyle@...</a> 06/19/04 7:49 PM &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Can anyone explain why Jingo tsuba are so sought after?

It&#39;s probably not for everyone, but definitely try to see a top example in person if you can.  What do you think of Hirata Hikozo&#39;s work in copper, for example?
