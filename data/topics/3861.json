Be that as it may, let me interject two self-learned Chicken<br/>\ntruths about rust:<br/>\n<br/>\n1. It&#39;s always worse than it looks.  If there is ANY surface<br/>\ndiscoloration (red, black, gray, even white), then there is pitting. <br/>\nMore a problem, of course, on blades as opposed to tsuba.  But any<br/>\nrusting of any kind means more than just finger stones on blades to<br/>\ncorrect the damage.  I have not the experience on kodogu to say<br/>\nsomething even semi-intelligent, but suspect that if any discoloration<br/>\nis removed, the surface will not be as smooth as when first made,<br/>\nunless considerable nearby unrusted metal is removed as well.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. When there is scabby red/brown rust on blades, the pitting is kinda<br/>\nbad to extremely bad, and it&#39;s difficult to impossible to tell simply<br/>\nby looking which it is.  This Chicken truism comes from polishing<br/>\n(&quot;Forgive me, God, for I have sinned&quot;) two Pacific Era gunto with<br/>\nequivalent scabby surface rust.  Paradoxically, on the the traditional<br/>\ntamahagane (no stamps) gunto, the rust pits went to China, in depth<br/>\nthey were as long or longer than their width.  I couldn&#39;t get out all<br/>\nthe pitting without grinding away over three hundred years worth of<br/>\nmetal, and had ot give up with about five percent of the pits<br/>\nremaining.  On the non-traditional, Seki-stamped gunto (Kumemune<br/>\nmentioned a while ago), though the surface rust was essentially<br/>\nidentical, the pits were no where near as deep, and, as it turned out,<br/>\nnot deeper than the waves in the crap wartime polish, and so were not<br/>\nthe major concern in the end.<br/>\n<br/>\nBottom line, rust is either bad, or extremely bad, and it&#39;s tough to<br/>\ntell between the two before getting serious.  FWIW, JMO.<br/>\n<br/>\nNC  ;o)</div>",

Looking at the front of the guard it does appear to be Edo period and indeterminate style.  I suspect that what you&#39;re seeing in the rim may be the structure of the forge welding brought out by the rust.  It&#39;s not unusual to see pronounced layering in, for example, Akasaka guards that have been badly rusted.  Seeing a sharp ridge like that would be unusual for tekkotsu.  Also tekkotsu are usually smoother, darker and more lustrous than the surrounding iron (although not always so with Kanayama).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I do however have a Kanayama tsuba that I think is quite old that has a somewhat similar look in the rim.  I&#39;ve never been able to decide how much of the appearance is due to how it was made vs. how it might have rusted.  Next time I set up to take macro photos I&#39;ll get some images of the rim for comparison.

I plan to update the photos<br/>\n&gt; on my site and will include images of rims where<br/>\n&gt; there is something to see.  Given storage and<br/>\n&gt; bandwidth limitations I will probably have to get<br/>\n&gt; rid of the pieces that I don&#39;t have any longer so<br/>\n&gt; that I can focus on the best examples.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The technical aspects of tekkotsu are far from<br/>\n&gt; settled.  The quote that Pete posted from the<br/>\n&gt; Solingen catalog is an interesting one.  I don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; know whether that is how tekkotsu were formed in the<br/>\n&gt; Muromachi period.  I have read hypotheses crediting<br/>\n&gt; everything from the source of the ore onward for<br/>\n&gt; being the cause of tekkotsu.  There is even an idea<br/>\n&gt; that the bones were not even visible in the original<br/>\n&gt; piece but are only revealed over time due to the<br/>\n&gt; corrosion and/or wear resistance of the higher<br/>\n&gt; carbon regions.  I doubt that that&#39;s entirely true,<br/>\n&gt; but it is a factor for guards with condition<br/>\n&gt; problems -- the tekkotsu will stand out.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Jim<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   Jim,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   Excellent, while of course I would love to handle<br/>\n&gt;   them,  these pictures are the next best thing. <br/>\n&gt; Great<br/>\n&gt;   stuff and makes it clearer.  If someone had the<br/>\n&gt; time,<br/>\n&gt;   it would be great to put these up on<br/>\n&gt; your/someone&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;   website.  All these sites devoted to swords, could<br/>\n&gt; use<br/>\n&gt;   some more to tsuba.  Would love to see tekkotsu<br/>\n&gt;   website depicting various schools.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   Now for the next question- why so different? <br/>\n&gt; metal<br/>\n&gt;   used? folding techniques?  when forming the mimi<br/>\n&gt; what<br/>\n&gt;   steps would they do (I know big questions)?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   Thanks- as always you are extremely helpful.<br/>\n&gt;   Ken<br/>\n&gt;   &#92;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been<br/>\n&gt; removed]<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTired of spam?

            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1828824069\">Rich,<br/>\nI tend to agree with Alan.  Looking at the front of the guard it does appear to be Edo period and indeterminate style.  I suspect that what you&#39;re seeing in the rim may be the structure of the forge welding brought out by the rust.  It&#39;s not unusual to see pronounced layering in, for example, Akasaka guards that have been badly rusted.  Seeing a sharp ridge like that would be unusual for tekkotsu.  Also tekkotsu are usually smoother, darker and more lustrous than the surrounding iron (although not always so with Kanayama).<br/>\n<br/>\nI do however have a Kanayama tsuba that I think is quite old that has a somewhat similar look in the rim.  I&#39;ve never been able to decide how much of the appearance is due to how it was made vs. how it might have rusted.  Next time I set up to take macro photos I&#39;ll get some images of the rim for comparison.  The face of that guard also looks quite old and in Kanayama style, though.<br/>\n<br/>\nJim<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Hi Alan, it may be a little pitted in the mimi but they are bones, and <br/>\n  too big I think for edo, though not necessarily so I guess.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Cheer<br/>\n<br/>\n  Rich<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Alan Bale wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">   &gt; It looks like Edo period Kyo-sukashi in poor shape with a pitted mimi.<br/>\n  &gt; Alan<br/>\n  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n  &gt;   Nice Jim, good work. These are excellent photo&#39;s and an invaluable help. <br/>\n  &gt;   If I may, how would you classify this ?.<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt;   The condition is down a bit ( as are the photo&#39;s sorry ).

There are also small bones in the hira, running around the <br/>\n  &gt;   mimi. I have not been able to pin the theme either, besides the ginger <br/>\n  &gt;   leaves.<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt;   Any clues appreciated.<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt;   <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.nihontomessageboard.com/personal/owari-hira.jpg\">http://www.nihontomessageboard.com/personal/owari-hira.jpg</a><br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt;   <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.nihontomessageboard.com/personal/owari-mimi.jpg\">http://www.nihontomessageboard.com/personal/owari-mimi.jpg</a><br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt;   best wishes<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt;   Rich<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",

In general, yes, tekkotsu are a good thing, at least for Owari region work.  I can&#39;t think of a case where it would indicate poor quality.  It&#39;s part of what separates the better Owari, Kanayama, etc., work from the routine products.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe mid to late Muromachi period is prime time for tekkotsu and they continue to a lesser degree in Momoyama.  Early Edo period Yagyu, Ono and sometimes Akasaka will also show them, although not in quite the same way as Muromachi period Owari sukashi or Kanayama.  In general they are not seen in Edo period work.  Norisuke and other late Edo copies of Yamakichibei, Kanayama, Nobuie, etc., will show tekkotsu, but they generally look forced and artificial, often oversized and overdone.  Of course sometimes maybe they got it right too, and we&#39;re still being fooled by those pieces.<br/>\n<br/>\nOccasionally Edo period Shoami work will be carved to simulate tekkotsu and other features of earlier-period smiting.<br/>\n<br/>\nJim<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Jim,<br/>\n<br/>\n  BRILLIANT - one picture is truly worth a thousand words, let alone five!

A couple of questions spring to mind:<br/>\n<br/>\n  - Is tekkotsu limited to a &quot;time window&quot;??  That is, is it only found in certain<br/>\n  iron tsuba (sukashi??) from say (hahaha) 1500 to 1620??  I guess most Edo iron<br/>\n  tsuba don&#39;t have tekkotsu.<br/>\n<br/>\n  - Is tekkotsu when found a &quot;good&quot; indicator???<br/>\n<br/>\n  Thanks for great pics.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Best regards,<br/>\n  Barry Thomas.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",

Given storage and bandwidth limitations I will probably have to get rid of the pieces that I don&#39;t have any longer so that I can focus on the best examples.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe technical aspects of tekkotsu are far from settled.  The quote that Pete posted from the Solingen catalog is an interesting one.  I don&#39;t know whether that is how tekkotsu were formed in the Muromachi period.  I have read hypotheses crediting everything from the source of the ore onward for being the cause of tekkotsu.  There is even an idea that the bones were not even visible in the original piece but are only revealed over time due to the corrosion and/or wear resistance of the higher carbon regions.  I doubt that that&#39;s entirely true, but it is a factor for guards with condition problems -- the tekkotsu will stand out.<br/>\n<br/>\nJim<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Jim,<br/>\n<br/>\n  Excellent, while of course I would love to handle<br/>\n  them,  these pictures are the next best thing.

I guess most Edo iron<br/>\ntsuba don&#39;t have tekkotsu.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Is tekkotsu when found a &quot;good&quot; indicator???<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for great pics.<br/>\n<br/>\nBest regards,<br/>\nBarry Thomas.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Jim Gilbert&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jggilbert@...\">jggilbert@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com\">nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, March 15, 2006 3:27 AM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [nihontostudy] Kantei setsumei<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nKen,<br/>\nI photographed some Kanayama tekkotsu and posted them here:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://ph.groups.yahoo.com/group/nihontostudy/photos/browse/d4b0\">http://ph.groups.yahoo.com/group/nihontostudy/photos/browse/d4b0</a><br/>\n<br/>\nHopefully it will make things more rather than less clear.

The<br/>\n&gt; photos of the mimi give some sense of the tekkotsu<br/>\n&gt; that place the guard in the Owari region.  Given the<br/>\n&gt; shape of the rim and the design, the two most likely<br/>\n&gt; choices are Kanayama and Owari sukashi.  I think<br/>\n&gt; either answer is acceptable given that you are<br/>\n&gt; working from pictures.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The thickness and somewhat squared rim lean toward<br/>\n&gt; Kanayama, but can also be seen in Owari work.  The<br/>\n&gt; guard is on the thick end of the spectrum for either<br/>\n&gt; type.  The diameter is possible for either group,<br/>\n&gt; although on the large side for Kanayama.  The style<br/>\n&gt; of the tekkotsu is the most important point. <br/>\n&gt; Kanayama tekkotsu tend to form pronounced, sometimes<br/>\n&gt; rough bumps.  Owari tekkotsu are low, smooth and<br/>\n&gt; emerge from the plate with more subtlety, forming<br/>\n&gt; &quot;bean&quot; shaped and &quot;rope&quot; forms.  This guard shows<br/>\n&gt; both of these latter types.  Also, Kanayama guards<br/>\n&gt; will often show some tekkotsu on the face, but Owari<br/>\n&gt; guards do not.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Wild goose designs are common in Owari work.  It&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; not impossible to imagine a design like this in a<br/>\n&gt; Kanayama guard, but it is more naturalistic,<br/>\n&gt; complicated and even a little delicate for that<br/>\n&gt; group.  The majority of the evidence points toward<br/>\n&gt; Owari sukashi.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The guard is in very good condition, so it may look<br/>\n&gt; younger than it is.  The quality of the iron and the<br/>\n&gt; tekkotsu are unlikely to date to the early Edo<br/>\n&gt; period, and are consistent with pieces from mid to<br/>\n&gt; late Muromachi.  The birds at the top and bottom of<br/>\n&gt; the sukashi design seem too free spirited to be from<br/>\n&gt; that time, though and seem more like Momoyama. <br/>\n&gt; Given that design is easier to manipulate than iron,<br/>\n&gt; I lean toward late Muromachi, but Momoyama is<br/>\n&gt; possible.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The guard has a kanteisho to Owari from the NBTHK. <br/>\n&gt; No date given.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Yagyu is in the correct region, but the texture of<br/>\n&gt; the metal will be cloudy/sandy and will tend to show<br/>\n&gt; many linear laminations in the rim.  It is also not<br/>\n&gt; a Yagyu design.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I included this tsuba in the Akasaka display at<br/>\n&gt; Tampa to show the likely Owari origins of the<br/>\n&gt; Akasaka group.  While some Ko-Akasaka guards will<br/>\n&gt; show tekkotsu, they are not of this type and the<br/>\n&gt; color and texture of the iron is different.  The rim<br/>\n&gt; would show a more rounded shape in Akasaka.  The<br/>\n&gt; cutting of the sukashi would have sharper edges. <br/>\n&gt; The design does have a bit of Akasaka feeling, but<br/>\n&gt; there would probably be more asymmetry and<br/>\n&gt; abstraction in an Akasaka piece.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; That&#39;s all I can think of at the moment.

The photos of the mimi give some sense of the tekkotsu<br/>\nthat place the guard in the Owari region.  Given the shape of the rim and<br/>\nthe design, the two most likely choices are Kanayama and Owari sukashi.  I<br/>\nthink either answer is acceptable given that you are working from pictures.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe thickness and somewhat squared rim lean toward Kanayama, but can also be<br/>\nseen in Owari work.  The guard is on the thick end of the spectrum for<br/>\neither type.  The diameter is possible for either group, although on the<br/>\nlarge side for Kanayama.  The style of the tekkotsu is the most important<br/>\npoint.  Kanayama tekkotsu tend to form pronounced, sometimes rough bumps.<br/>\nOwari tekkotsu are low, smooth and emerge from the plate with more subtlety,<br/>\nforming &quot;bean&quot; shaped and &quot;rope&quot; forms.  This guard shows both of these<br/>\nlatter types.  Also, Kanayama guards will often show some tekkotsu on the<br/>\nface, but Owari guards do not.<br/>\n<br/>\nWild goose designs are common in Owari work.  It&#39;s not impossible to imagine<br/>\na design like this in a Kanayama guard, but it is more naturalistic,<br/>\ncomplicated and even a little delicate for that group.  The majority of the<br/>\nevidence points toward Owari sukashi.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe guard is in very good condition, so it may look younger than it is.  The<br/>\nquality of the iron and the tekkotsu are unlikely to date to the early Edo<br/>\nperiod, and are consistent with pieces from mid to late Muromachi.  The<br/>\nbirds at the top and bottom of the sukashi design seem too free spirited to<br/>\nbe from that time, though and seem more like Momoyama.  Given that design is<br/>\neasier to manipulate than iron, I lean toward late Muromachi, but Momoyama<br/>\nis possible.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe guard has a kanteisho to Owari from the NBTHK.  No date given.<br/>\n<br/>\nYagyu is in the correct region, but the texture of the metal will be<br/>\ncloudy/sandy and will tend to show many linear laminations in the rim.  It<br/>\nis also not a Yagyu design.<br/>\n<br/>\nI included this tsuba in the Akasaka display at Tampa to show the likely<br/>\nOwari origins of the Akasaka group.  While some Ko-Akasaka guards will show<br/>\ntekkotsu, they are not of this type and the color and texture of the iron is<br/>\ndifferent.  The rim would show a more rounded shape in Akasaka.  The cutting<br/>\nof the sukashi would have sharper edges.  The design does have a bit of<br/>\nAkasaka feeling, but there would probably be more asymmetry and abstraction<br/>\nin an Akasaka piece.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s all I can think of at the moment.
