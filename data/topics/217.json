            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1836506371\">From late Heian, actually.  The examples I&#39;ve seen in the outside of Japan have all been Edo period, and most if not all from the late Edo period.  They&#39;re quite new and shiny looking.  They often have some sort of decoration to the lacquer.  The fukurin (rim cover) are new and crisp looking.  The guards tend to be on the small side, but thicker than a similarly sized metal guard from the same period.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost of the Heian and Kamakura period examples at Oyamazumi are delaminated.  If they hadn&#39;t been left untouched &quot;strung&quot; on the nakago of the swords they&#39;re mounted on they would likely have been discarded long ago.  Probably one reason why there are so few old examples around.  Mokko shape seems to predominate.  These tend to be larger diameter with moderate thickness.  The ones that are still intact just look very old in comparison to the Edo period examples.  Hard to be more quantitative about that.  I can&#39;t remember seeing a decorated example from the early period.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t have a big enough sample to work from to be too confident, but the nerikawa guards from late Kamakura, Nanbokucho and early Muromachi tend to look disproportionately thick compared to the earlier ones.  The Nanbokucho and Muromachi ones are more often round or oval shaped rather than mokko.  Some mokko examples from that time have unusually small &quot;lobes.&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s all I can think of for now.<br/>\n<br/>\nJim<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  hi ye all,<br/>\n  question...............how do you date nerikawa tsuba since they were <br/>\n  made from Kamakura period all the way to edo ?

I took 3 pieces of 1-2<br/>\n  mm thick &quot;dog grade&quot; pre-chewed rawhide and soaked them in water for<br/>\n  several hours until they were completely soft and pliable.  I pressed the<br/>\n  three layers tightly together between two boards in a bench vise and left<br/>\n  them over night.  I then glued the three still moist pieces together with<br/>\n  an aliphatic wood glue.  I suspect that a hide or hoof glue would be<br/>\ncloser<br/>\n  to what was originally used, but I didn&#39;t have any handy.  Then it went<br/>\n  back into the vise press over night.<br/>\n<br/>\n  The stack came out well-adhered, but still flexible.  It was fairly easy<br/>\nto<br/>\n  cut through with multiple passes of a sharp knife.  After a day of drying<br/>\n  in the sun, the laminated piece was much more rigid and didn&#39;t warp.<br/>\n  Rainy weather called for subsequent drying in the house.  After a couple<br/>\nof<br/>\n  days the 3 layer laminate can still be flexed a few mm by hand.  At this<br/>\n  point the laminate is quite hard to cut, but easy to saw or shape with a<br/>\n  rasp.  The layers stay well adhered during these operations.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I am not trained as a swordsman and I have no swords handy, so I resorted<br/>\n  to a ca. WWII vintage Gurkha Kukri for test cutting.  The cross section is<br/>\n  on the thick side for a knife, but &quot;sharper&quot; than the typical nihonto.  I<br/>\n  clamped one end of my &quot;tsuba&quot; to a bench, leaving about 4.5 cm of<br/>\n  unsupported material sticking out into space.  I had no success in<br/>\nrepeated<br/>\n  tries at cutting the face of the tsuba.  There is enough flex in the<br/>\n  laminated leather to send the blade skidding off from the face of the<br/>\n  guard, just occasionally taking a sliver of material from the edge.  I<br/>\n  suppose that a perfect slicing cut with a sword would do more damage, but<br/>\n  then again in use you weren&#39;t likely to fight against an opponent with his<br/>\n  sword hand clamped down to a bench.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Turning the &quot;tsuba&quot; edge up to test cutting straight into the mimi was an<br/>\n  entirely different story.  A light chop was enough to cut over 1 cm into<br/>\n  the edge.  No doubt there were ways to make a tougher guard than I did,<br/>\n  however I have to believe that these would not be sufficient to stop a<br/>\n  strong sword cut to the edge from cutting entirely through the guard,<br/>\n  including any yamagane fukurin or o-seppa.<br/>\n<br/>\n  So, long story, but what I found is that as long as someone else cures the<br/>\n  hide it&#39;s quite easy to make a functional kawa tsuba.  Lacquer and a<br/>\n  fukurin would dress the guard up and help protect it from moisture, but I<br/>\n  don&#39;t think would change the basic properties of the tsuba.  It is tough<br/>\n  and light weight, would certainly keep one&#39;s hand from sliding up on the<br/>\n  blade and it would seem to be effective at stopping a opponent&#39;s cut that<br/>\n  came sliding down the blade.  However, it would be next to useless at<br/>\n  stopping a cut to the edge.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Speculation -- was there something about the way that a tachi was used<br/>\nthat<br/>\n  would make a cut to the edge of the guard relatively unlikely when<br/>\ncompared<br/>\n  to wielding a katana?  It might help explain why nerikawa tsuba were the<br/>\n  guard of choice for fighting tachi, but were replaced by iron for katana.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Jim<br/>\n<br/>\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:<br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nihontostudy-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\">nihontostudy-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Your use of Yahoo!

Lacquer and a<br/>\nfukurin would dress the guard up and help protect it from moisture, but I<br/>\ndon&#39;t think would change the basic properties of the tsuba.  It is tough<br/>\nand light weight, would certainly keep one&#39;s hand from sliding up on the<br/>\nblade and it would seem to be effective at stopping a opponent&#39;s cut that<br/>\ncame sliding down the blade.

It might help explain why nerikawa tsuba were the<br/>\nguard of choice for fighting tachi, but were replaced by iron for katana.<br/>\n<br/>\nJim<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nihontostudy-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\">nihontostudy-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYour use of Yahoo!

I took 3 pieces of 1-2 mm thick &quot;dog grade&quot; pre-chewed rawhide and soaked them in water for several hours until they were completely soft and pliable.  I pressed the three layers tightly together between two boards in a bench vise and left them over night.  I then glued the three still moist pieces together with an aliphatic wood glue.
