I got to see one<br/>\n&gt; of those Hong Kong Crappers up close and personal. I<br/>\n&gt; had a new<br/>\n&gt; acquaintance make a 5 hour drive up from the<br/>\n&gt; southern part of the state<br/>\n&gt; today to meet and greet and share his new sword with<br/>\n&gt; me. A young man in<br/>\n&gt; his late teens. He was lucky in the sense that he<br/>\n&gt; didn&#39;t pay for this<br/>\n&gt; sword, it was a gift, but someone bought it for him,<br/>\n&gt; mores the pity for<br/>\n&gt; them. <br/>\n&gt; It was decked out in what appeared to be standard<br/>\n&gt; gunto mount&#39;s that<br/>\n&gt; turned out to be very poorly made indeed. The blade<br/>\n&gt; really isn&#39;t worthy<br/>\n&gt; of mention, very poorly acid etched hamon, cheap old<br/>\n&gt; iron that had been<br/>\n&gt; ground into shape. The mei looked like it was<br/>\n&gt; scratched out with a nail<br/>\n&gt; or something. It was so badly made I couldn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; believe it. Still, he<br/>\n&gt; hangs it on his wall and enjoys it for what it is at<br/>\n&gt; the moment. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; He want&#39;s to come to one of the local auctions later<br/>\n&gt; in the year. I<br/>\n&gt; didn&#39;t have anything to show him as we met at my<br/>\n&gt; office but I said when<br/>\n&gt; he sees something that is properly made he will<br/>\n&gt; understand more, for now<br/>\n&gt; his cheap and nasty HKC can hang on his wall and he<br/>\n&gt; can dream of betters<br/>\n&gt; things ahead. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Maybe with luck, in a few month&#39;s time we will have<br/>\n&gt; another convert in<br/>\n&gt; our midst. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; cheers all <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Rich T<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been<br/>\n&gt; removed]<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!
