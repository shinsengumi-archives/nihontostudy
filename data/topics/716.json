They signed in the<br/>\nsame manner, though they were in Hizen. These exist I think in a void<br/>\nbetween gimei and the real deal. Maybe it&#39;s like some dude downtown<br/>\nclaiming Picasso was his great-great grandfather, so choosing to paint<br/>\n&quot;picasso&quot; style and signing &quot;picasso.&quot; While those are not technically<br/>\nforgeries, they&#39;re also not the real thing, but they are those dude&#39;s<br/>\npaintings. I have one of the Saga group pieces (as do probably many<br/>\npeople), and I also have one that would seem to be an homage piece, not<br/>\nsigned Kaneie but signed Yamashiro Kuni ... Masa[X] which is not quite<br/>\nlegible... I am sending it to Cary for research.... disclaimer: I know<br/>\nless about tsuba than I do about swords, correction is gladly taken as<br/>\nlearning information, I am passing on what I have read/listened to<br/>\nintently, if there are errors in that it is because I have inserted<br/>\nthem out of ignorance.)</div>",

It was at a <br/>\nlocal antique shop for over a year before I picked it up for a very low price. <br/>\n It was hidden in an over packed display case from a dealer in other types of <br/>\noriental art.
