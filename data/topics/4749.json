He is not listed in Hawley, Koto <br/>\nNihonto Zuikan, JSS cross-index or Yamanka&#39;s newsletters. I have a well <br/>\nworn wakishasi of his with all the typical Miike characteristics (wide <br/>\nhi, narrow suguha, etc.) and have been trying to find out any <br/>\nadditional information on this particular smith. The signature on the <br/>\nblade is Miike ju Sada Hide (very faint). Hopefully there are some <br/>\nbetter libraries out there...</div>",
