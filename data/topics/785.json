            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-867235741\">Jim, Rich - <br/>\n<br/>\nBrings to mind a tsuba I sold earlier this year which looked classical Akasaka...sort of. Sasano papered it years ago to one of the Akasaka generations (when a friend owned it). Later, it ended up in a Haynes auction where Bob explained it was papered Akasaka, but it is possibly Tosa Myochin. I bought the tsuba and Bob didn&#39;t send the papers. I had to ask for them and when he gave them to me (at a show) he grumbled about the call being all wrong, that they were definitely Tosa Myochin. The tsuba did have the &quot;wiskers&quot; tagane marks on the seppa-dai. Always have to laugh when I recall how upset Bob was about the Sasano call.  <br/>\n<br/>\nRon<br/>\nSTL<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Jim Gilbert <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com\">nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Thursday, September 18, 2003 7:19 PM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [nihontostudy] Re: Tosa Tsuba smiths<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Rich,<br/>\n  Your piece does not have the classic Tosa Myochin-style tagane-mei, but I don&#39;t think that all pieces do.

Usually it is more a matter of lacking attributes that would normally be found on earlier mainline Akasaka or Higo piece.  With Akasaka or Higo guards of the same period there is very little if any difference between the best Tosa Myochin work and the originals.  Even with lesser work, there are pieces that are a toss up between later followers of the original groups or the lesser Tosa Myochin.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIn general it can be very difficult to determine the maker of unsigned mid to lower level work in the mid to late Edo periods.  People could and did make whatever the customer wanted.  Sometimes you&#39;ll run across the signature of a maker that would not have even made your best guess list if the piece was mumei.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ll have to take a closer look at the signed Tosa Myochin pieces in the future to see if I can pick up any clues.<br/>\n<br/>\nJim<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Rich,<br/>\n<br/>\n  Very nice tsuba.
