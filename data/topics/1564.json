In general it&#39;s not a good idea.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf we&#39;re talking about the previous owner&#39;s kid playing with the sword in the back yard and getting mud all over the tsuka ito, then, yes that&#39;s better off cleaned if it&#39;s done correctly.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf we&#39;re talking about removing &quot;patina of use,&quot; then that is not such a good proposition.  As with all things in this field if it is done poorly it will wreck the piece.  Some of the older koshirae that I have seen certified at shinsa had buildup from use on the ito.  It&#39;s not a bad thing.  Aggressive cleaning can damage the ito and same, and that is a bad thing indeed.  <br/>\n<br/>\nCareful cleaning may not damage anything, but if you do it to an older tsuka, it can make it difficult or impossible to identify the true age of the piece.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is not your goal to make old koshirae look fresh and new.  <br/>\n<br/>\nJim<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  I think that is not a good idea.
