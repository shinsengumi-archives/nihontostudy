It is indeed in shirasaya, and also has Tanobe<br/>\n&gt; sensei&#39;s sayagaki on it. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; You hit on a lot of items why it is a collectable piece. There are <br/>\na lot<br/>\n&gt; of activities in the hamon too, making it a good study sword, and of<br/>\n&gt; course it is also representative of its times. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The horimono are not etched as was previously suggested by the <br/>\nquestion<br/>\n&gt; asker. Horimono like this are carved. Naotsuna are often found with<br/>\n&gt; bohi, but horimono like this are quite rare on his works, and there <br/>\nare<br/>\n&gt; very few tanto by this smith (none are signed).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; There are three mekugi ana most likely on this tanto because it has <br/>\ngone<br/>\n&gt; into three different sets of fittings (or more) over its lifetime. <br/>\nThat,<br/>\n&gt; and the frequent polishing, would likely point to this as being a <br/>\nwell<br/>\n&gt; used weapon, rather than something that spent most of its life as an<br/>\n&gt; object of adoration. Those are my guesses at it.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; For the original poster, in terms of the high end Soshu smiths, this<br/>\n&gt; represents entry-level price, so the question is more one of what is<br/>\n&gt; holding this one back from higher prices I would think. The hamon is<br/>\n&gt; still lively on this tanto, but it is at the point where I wouldn&#39;t <br/>\nwant<br/>\n&gt; to put one, or two more polishes on it. That is pretty much the only<br/>\n&gt; thing against it in my book, but then there are others who have<br/>\n&gt; different tastes in school, smith, period, and type.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; - darcy<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &lt;ashigaru1@y...&gt; writes:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; While described as being slightly &quot;tired&quot; this tanto has much <br/>\ngoing <br/>\n&gt; &gt; for it.

It is indeed in shirasaya, and also has Tanobe<br/>\nsensei&#39;s sayagaki on it. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou hit on a lot of items why it is a collectable piece. There are a lot<br/>\nof activities in the hamon too, making it a good study sword, and of<br/>\ncourse it is also representative of its times. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe horimono are not etched as was previously suggested by the question<br/>\nasker. Horimono like this are carved. Naotsuna are often found with<br/>\nbohi, but horimono like this are quite rare on his works, and there are<br/>\nvery few tanto by this smith (none are signed).<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are three mekugi ana most likely on this tanto because it has gone<br/>\ninto three different sets of fittings (or more) over its lifetime. That,<br/>\nand the frequent polishing, would likely point to this as being a well<br/>\nused weapon, rather than something that spent most of its life as an<br/>\nobject of adoration. Those are my guesses at it.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor the original poster, in terms of the high end Soshu smiths, this<br/>\nrepresents entry-level price, so the question is more one of what is<br/>\nholding this one back from higher prices I would think. The hamon is<br/>\nstill lively on this tanto, but it is at the point where I wouldn&#39;t want<br/>\nto put one, or two more polishes on it. That is pretty much the only<br/>\nthing against it in my book, but then there are others who have<br/>\ndifferent tastes in school, smith, period, and type.<br/>\n<br/>\n- darcy<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ashigaru1@...\">ashigaru1@...</a>&gt; writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; While described as being slightly &quot;tired&quot; this tanto has much going <br/>\n&gt; for it.
