A friend of mine has a Naotane<br/>\nwakizashi with a kokuin that reads in katakana &quot;KOROMO&quot;, the town where<br/>\nNaotane made the sword.  This stamp has been struck slightly off true.  I&#39;m<br/>\nnot in metallurgy either, but I would speculate that when a hardened stamp<br/>\nis placed against a tang resting on a very heavy anvil then struck very hard<br/>\nwith a 10 kilo hammer, that the softer tang metal truly flows like caramel<br/>\nfudge - somewhat like the phenomenon of explosive plastic deformation.  I<br/>\nremember reading of a swordsmith in Japan who (in an interview) said that<br/>\nmetal can be pushed around from place to place.  So all in all, considering<br/>\nwhat little I do know of metallurgy I think it is done as I have outlined.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Gassan with the stamp is more likely to be by Sadakazu 1st than<br/>\nSadakatsu.  I have a monograph written by Benjamin Hazard of a Gassan I<br/>\ntanto in the MMA that has a kokuin (from a failing memory...).<br/>\n<br/>\nRegards,<br/>\n<br/>\nBarry Thomas.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Richard Turner &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ikkanshi@...\">ikkanshi@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com\">nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, December 01, 2004 9:29 AM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [nihontostudy] kokuin (stamped seals)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNot being involved in metallurgy at all, could not the stamp be white<br/>\nhot and pressed into the nakago ?, keeping the &#39;hot area&#39; to a minimum ?.<br/>\n<br/>\nRich<br/>\n<br/>\nRon Hartmann wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Matt, Rich, all -<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yes, the Gassan did this thing, too.
