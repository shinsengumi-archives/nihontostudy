It isn&#39;t until legislators <br/>\nand the population in general realise that if it wasn&#39;t these cheap <br/>\nreplica edged weapons being used it would be something else just just <br/>\nas deadly, eg. machete, axe etc. In fact most violent crime is <br/>\ncommitted with weapons of chance (those that are to hand during fits <br/>\nof rage) and those crimes of violence committed by persons who make <br/>\nconscious use of a weapon in a planned way would in no way be stopped <br/>\nfrom their crime by legislation that bans or restricts legitimate <br/>\ncollectors rights. This affects us and we should be aware that some <br/>\nwould believe that legislating against possession of edged weapons <br/>\nwould make society safer. John</div>",
