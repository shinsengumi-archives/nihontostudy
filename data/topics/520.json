It is titled: &quot;Japane&#39;s Military Masters&quot; and was written by a Mr. Hillis Lory (then of Palo Alto, California) and published by Viking Press in 1943.  A quick look-through found several interesting topics such as the monthly salaries of Japanese officers and mention of importance of swords coming out of the Yasukuni Shrine forge. Basically, the book deals with &quot;knowing your enemy&quot; and his thinking. The author had spent years in Japan during the 1920s and 1930s and saw the military power develope.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m just curious is anyone is familiar with this book or its author and if he ever became &quot;known.&quot; Looking forward to reading this most interesting war-era book!  <br/>\n<br/>\nRon<br/>\nSTL<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
