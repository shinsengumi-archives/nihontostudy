Leaf shape. Flower<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; petal<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; engraving. Flower engraving. General<br/>\n&gt; composition.<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; Very<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; much like a painting, the great number of<br/>\n&gt; details<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; evident in a soft metal heavily carved piece<br/>\n&gt; like<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; this<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; seem to me a signature.

I&#39;d be surprised if I actually got a<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; &#39;Norisuke&#39; call on this, but as a<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; newbie-intermediate<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; having something like this seem to click into<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; place<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; has been very satisfying.

Leaf shape. Flower<br/>\n  &gt; petal<br/>\n  &gt; engraving. Flower engraving. General composition.<br/>\n  &gt; Very<br/>\n  &gt; much like a painting, the great number of details<br/>\n  &gt; evident in a soft metal heavily carved piece like<br/>\n  &gt; this<br/>\n  &gt; seem to me a signature. There is some variation,<br/>\n  &gt; like<br/>\n  &gt; there is a very similar 1st gen Norisuke example<br/>\n  &gt; with<br/>\n  &gt; near identical leaves, but the main vein of the<br/>\n  &gt; leaf<br/>\n  &gt; is done in a single track of gold vs the double<br/>\n  &gt; vein I<br/>\n  &gt; have on this leaf.<br/>\n  &gt; I like to figure things out before I submit them<br/>\n  &gt; to<br/>\n  &gt; shinsa, and sometimes if I am happy enough with an<br/>\n  &gt; answer and intend to keep a piece- I don&#39;t submit<br/>\n  &gt; to<br/>\n  &gt; shinsa. I&#39;d be surprised if I actually got a<br/>\n  &gt; &#39;Norisuke&#39; call on this, but as a<br/>\n  &gt; newbie-intermediate<br/>\n  &gt; having something like this seem to click into<br/>\n  &gt; place<br/>\n  &gt; has been very satisfying. Yet I may be absolutely<br/>\n  &gt; wrong! So if I can stand on someone&#39;s shoulder and<br/>\n  &gt; see<br/>\n  &gt; further into this.... I welcome the view.<br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt; If you want to take a crack at the other tsuba<br/>\n  &gt; that<br/>\n  &gt; has been a challenge for me, I will dig that photo<br/>\n  &gt; out<br/>\n  &gt; too and post it. This &#39;Norisuke&#39; has been the more<br/>\n  &gt; interesting piece and horribly difficult to<br/>\n  &gt; photograph<br/>\n  &gt; given the highly reflective shakudo and gold.<br/>\n  &gt; Photography is not a strong skill for me, yet the<br/>\n  &gt; devil of a good identification is also in the<br/>\n  &gt; detail<br/>\n  &gt; of the other one.<br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt; Curran<br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt; --- Alan Bale &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:abale@...\">abale@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt; &gt; Is the tsuba iron or shakudo?

It is<br/>\n&gt; very<br/>\n&gt;   heavy. The gold wire used is also very heavy<br/>\n&gt; guage,<br/>\n&gt;   set extremely deep into channels. It has retained<br/>\n&gt;   about 99.9% of the inlay, but there is a small<br/>\n&gt; spot on<br/>\n&gt;   the mimi where I can see how deep the channels run<br/>\n&gt; and<br/>\n&gt;   the gold wire extends all the way into it.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   According to Haynes and one or two other sources,<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt;   Norisuke line did work in Kinko sometimes.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   I am not saying with 100% certainty that this is a<br/>\n&gt;   Norisuke, but there is a similar tsuba out there<br/>\n&gt; by<br/>\n&gt;   Norisuke and the more that I look at other tsuba<br/>\n&gt; by<br/>\n&gt;   the Norisuke family, the more I see the same<br/>\n&gt; design<br/>\n&gt;   elements over and over again. Leaf shape. Flower<br/>\n&gt; petal<br/>\n&gt;   engraving. Flower engraving. General composition.<br/>\n&gt; Very<br/>\n&gt;   much like a painting, the great number of details<br/>\n&gt;   evident in a soft metal heavily carved piece like<br/>\n&gt; this<br/>\n&gt;   seem to me a signature. There is some variation,<br/>\n&gt; like<br/>\n&gt;   there is a very similar 1st gen Norisuke example<br/>\n&gt; with<br/>\n&gt;   near identical leaves, but the main vein of the<br/>\n&gt; leaf<br/>\n&gt;   is done in a single track of gold vs the double<br/>\n&gt; vein I<br/>\n&gt;   have on this leaf.<br/>\n&gt;   I like to figure things out before I submit them<br/>\n&gt; to<br/>\n&gt;   shinsa, and sometimes if I am happy enough with an<br/>\n&gt;   answer and intend to keep a piece- I don&#39;t submit<br/>\n&gt; to<br/>\n&gt;   shinsa. I&#39;d be surprised if I actually got a<br/>\n&gt;   &#39;Norisuke&#39; call on this, but as a<br/>\n&gt; newbie-intermediate<br/>\n&gt;   having something like this seem to click into<br/>\n&gt; place<br/>\n&gt;   has been very satisfying. Yet I may be absolutely<br/>\n&gt;   wrong! So if I can stand on someone&#39;s shoulder and<br/>\n&gt; see<br/>\n&gt;   further into this.... I welcome the view.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   If you want to take a crack at the other tsuba<br/>\n&gt; that<br/>\n&gt;   has been a challenge for me, I will dig that photo<br/>\n&gt; out<br/>\n&gt;   too and post it. This &#39;Norisuke&#39; has been the more<br/>\n&gt;   interesting piece and horribly difficult to<br/>\n&gt; photograph<br/>\n&gt;   given the highly reflective shakudo and gold.<br/>\n&gt;   Photography is not a strong skill for me, yet the<br/>\n&gt;   devil of a good identification is also in the<br/>\n&gt; detail<br/>\n&gt;   of the other one.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   Curran<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   --- Alan Bale &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:abale@...\">abale@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   &gt; Is the tsuba iron or shakudo?
