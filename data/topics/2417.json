Check out: #2288820817 and then go to &quot;sellers other auctions&quot; for additional copies. Lots of interesting oshigata/descriptions.<br/>\n<br/>\nFound a stack of these recently in my attic and decided to peddle them. Covers are slightly &quot;aged&quot; but not seriously. Good catalogue for cheap. (Put $27 Buy it now on them.) Nice book, especially for the newer collector. What a nice exhibit that one was!! <br/>\n<br/>\nAnybody want copies outside of Ebay, hollar privately, off-list: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:swords@...\">swords@...</a> <br/>\n<br/>\nRon<br/>\nSTL<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
