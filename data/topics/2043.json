Will try soon.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe tsuba image was definitely much more batlike WITH<br/>\nhorns. Without looking too far, I found a similar one<br/>\nin Hawley&#39;s Tsuba of Southern California book (page<br/>\n116, tsuba 569). This one is much more clearly the Nue<br/>\nof the Yorimasa story.<br/>\n<br/>\nI felt the friend&#39;s tsuba was more likely the Chinese<br/>\nGod of Archery, but am now unsure. I have not found<br/>\nany comparable images of the Chinese God of Archery on<br/>\nthe web, and need to see his tsuba again to be sure<br/>\nmemory has the right mental snapshot of the tsuba.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nCurran<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n__________________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nNew and Improved Yahoo!
