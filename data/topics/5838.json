I have to<br/>\n&gt; agree with chris this is looking more like a Shinshin-to piece and<br/>\n&gt; based on the few photos we have a Satsuma piece. He is thinking of<br/>\n&gt; Jigen Ryu and the profile of this tsuka certainly fits their<br/>\n&gt; standards, the small tsuba as well. The saya is a bit of an enigma<br/>\n&gt; since there appear to be no other fittings which might have provided<br/>\n&gt; some confirmation of that idea.<br/>\n&gt; \tI will agree with Barry as well the size and length of the<br/>\n&gt; blade, the deep hamachi and mune-machi, the ubu-ba that you report,  <br/>\n&gt; the mottled<br/>\n&gt; colour of the nakago and the presence of a shinobi-ana all suggest<br/>\n&gt; later manufacture. So Shinshin-to it is.<br/>\n&gt; \tThis is some find, and I would love to see more photos when you&#39;ve  <br/>\n&gt; the chance.

The tsuba is 16th  <br/>\n&gt;&gt; century Tachi-kanagushi work lacquered red and may be original to  <br/>\n&gt;&gt; the mounting.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; The blade is too discoloured to see any details but it has ububa of  <br/>\n&gt;&gt; 7&quot; and the edge side of the habaki has a slot cut into it to allow  <br/>\n&gt;&gt; for this.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; I assume this is the first of a group of similarly mounted weapons  <br/>\n&gt;&gt; ordered by a clan or Temple. I think that the sword has been kept  <br/>\n&gt;&gt; in storage for a very long time as it is not for everyday use,  <br/>\n&gt;&gt; weighing around 6lbs and is 4&#39;7&quot; long overall and is in mostly good  <br/>\n&gt;&gt; condition but with worm holes in the leather bound tsuka<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; I would like to know if anyone on the list has seen a similarly  <br/>\n&gt;&gt; mounted nagamaki, the black sam� and red lacquered binding are  <br/>\n&gt;&gt; distinctive. I would like to know where it came from.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; I have uploaded images at:<br/>\n&gt;&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.esnips.com/web/TsubaFittings\">http://www.esnips.com/web/TsubaFittings</a><br/>\n&gt;&gt; --^^---------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;&gt; This email was sent to: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:toryu@...\">toryu@...</a><br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; EASY UNSUBSCRIBE click here: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://topica.com/u/?b1dP6L.cjLeMJ.dG9yeXVA\">http://topica.com/u/?b1dP6L.cjLeMJ.dG9yeXVA</a><br/>\n&gt;&gt; Or send an email to: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:token_kenkyu_kai-unsubscribe@...\">token_kenkyu_kai-unsubscribe@...</a><br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; For Topica&#39;s complete suite of email marketing solutions visit:<br/>\n&gt;&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.topica.com/?p=TEXFOOTER\">http://www.topica.com/?p=TEXFOOTER</a><br/>\n&gt;&gt; --^^---------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
