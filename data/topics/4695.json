Enore<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Hi Enore,<br/>\n<br/>\nI rarely post here, but your message makes me feel obliged to respond.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can agree (to some extent) with an opinion that swords were made to <br/>\nbe used rather than for appreciation only. However, as you seem to <br/>\npractice sword arts, think about that: various ancient swordsmanship <br/>\nschools, methods, techniques were also created for active use <br/>\n(particularly - in battle), not for any sort of appreciation or <br/>\nsamurai-style fitness exercises. However it is considered a horrible <br/>\nmisconduct (among serious practitioners) to change the authentic <br/>\ntechniques for a reason of &#39;adapting it for oneself&#39; or even thinking <br/>\nthat &#39;certain technique is meant to be this way, not the way old <br/>\nteachers were doing it (for centuries)&#39;. I would say this principle <br/>\ncan well be applied to old swords: while created to be used, they are <br/>\nnot for change (unless in damaged condition) or unless your skills <br/>\nbecome equal or higher than skills of old masters.<br/>\n<br/>\nPractice sword supplies are plentiful at the moment. You may even <br/>\norder one to be made _exactly_ how you want it to be. I would agree <br/>\nwith others: please please please leave the sword unchanged. If it&#39;s <br/>\ntoo heavy/too long/too short - it&#39;s just not for you (for your <br/>\npractice). If you feel like training with old nihonto (to be frank I <br/>\ndon&#39;t support this idea and neither did different sensei I met), find <br/>\nthe sword which fits your hands as is, without change. I personally <br/>\ndo sometimes unsheath one of my swords to do a couple of slow cuts in <br/>\nthe air to &#39;get this feeling back&#39; ;-) But I would never consider <br/>\nusing it on a regular basis (or any basis) in training - well made <br/>\niaito is enough.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother reason it&#39;s not recommended is safety. Regardless how well <br/>\npreserved it looks, you simply don&#39;t know the history of this sword. <br/>\nAs somebody mentioned earlier it could have been treated with <br/>\nsome &#39;cosmetic surgery&#39; or even just have a natural flaw which didn&#39;t <br/>\nappear (yet) because the sword was _never_ used. By the way, adding <br/>\nbo-hi would only increase that risk.<br/>\n<br/>\nKind Regards,<br/>\nStan</div>",

            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-915468462\">Enore -<br/>\n\tYour passion for authentic practice is comendable. Your teacher it  <br/>\nseems has done something similar in pursuit of her idea of perfect  <br/>\nform. Most anyone here would not put in a bohi for practice or to  <br/>\nremove a flaw without serious study and long consideration. A skilled  <br/>\nman could probably put in a hi that was difficult to detect as ato- <br/>\nbori. However many of us here have seen good hi cut on old swords and  <br/>\nhave learned to look for them as a sign of age or worse; hidden  <br/>\nflaws. If the sword came in shirasaya someone thought enough of it to  <br/>\ntry to preserve it as is.<br/>\n\tYou asked for opinions and we would recommend that you not alter the  <br/>\nsword without more study, more study of swords, and more study of  <br/>\nswordsmanship. Batto-do is destructive no matter how good the  <br/>\nswordsman one should never cut with antique swords. Iaido believe it  <br/>\nor not is destructive, constant practice dulls blades, scuffs  <br/>\npolishes and eats up koshirae. Trust me I know. Restoring a sword  <br/>\nthat has been practised with can be a tricky process, one where fatal  <br/>\nflaws may come to light. Someone restored it once, polished it once  <br/>\nand put it in shirasaya for protection once, long ago. The hand of  <br/>\nour elders is apparent in that saya listen to what it is telling you.<br/>\n\tIn two years time you may find you prefer a longer sword or a  <br/>\nheavier sword or one with deeper curve. Some folks take ten years or  <br/>\nmore before they settle on the style of blade that best suits their  <br/>\npractise. Practise hard but proceed with caution you&#39;ll be glad you did.<br/>\nThomas C Helm<br/>\n6 Dan Muso Jiki Den Eishin Ryu</div>",

If you want a grooved blade order <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;       <br/>\n&gt; one or<br/>\n&gt;   <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; find one. At the very least you should not do anything until you <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;       <br/>\n&gt; have had<br/>\n&gt;   <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; your blade well shinsa&#39;d.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Still, your question does point up a basic feature of the world of<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; nippon-to. The values and standards of the various people <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;       <br/>\n&gt; involved in<br/>\n&gt;   <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Japanese swords are diverse. What is absolutely &quot;wrong&quot; to some <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;       <br/>\n&gt; is &quot;just<br/>\n&gt;   <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; fine&quot; to others. Most of us base our actions on our views of <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;       <br/>\n&gt; aesthetics and<br/>\n&gt;   <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; a sense of historical preservation. There are other values out <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;       <br/>\n&gt; there and<br/>\n&gt;   <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; knowing that helps to understand some of the things we see about <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;       <br/>\n&gt; swords.<br/>\n&gt;   <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; When I was first in Japan I happened to meet a number of sword <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;       <br/>\n&gt; craftsmen<br/>\n&gt;   <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; rather than collectors. Of course this was interesting (heck, it <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;       <br/>\n&gt; was<br/>\n&gt;   <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; wonderful), but it may have given me a skewed view.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; 1. The first &quot;smith&quot; I met ( and he was an important artist-and a<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; wonderful person) was re-tempering some old swords when I visited <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;       <br/>\n&gt; his<br/>\n&gt;   <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; forge.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; 2.  An important kinko proudly showed me his portfolio that <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;       <br/>\n&gt; included some<br/>\n&gt;   <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; very excellent &quot;umegane&quot; work he had done. He assured me that &quot;no <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;       <br/>\n&gt; one could<br/>\n&gt;   <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; see&quot; the fillings he had put into some seriously flawed blades.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; 3. During a road trip with a fellow who had recently completed his<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; polishing apprenticeship, we took a long extra trip to let his <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;       <br/>\n&gt; teacher see<br/>\n&gt;   <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; the grooves he was carving on a tanto. He was proud of his work <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;       <br/>\n&gt; and his<br/>\n&gt;   <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; master approved. When I asked why he was doing it, he said &quot;the <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;       <br/>\n&gt; smith<br/>\n&gt;   <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; should have put the grooves in.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; These men are not crooks or villains. Indeed, I think they are <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;       <br/>\n&gt; great<br/>\n&gt;   <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; artists and skilled students, but they operate with a different <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;       <br/>\n&gt; set of<br/>\n&gt;   <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; values.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; You certainly can find craftsmen who will do what you ask of <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;       <br/>\n&gt; them, but one<br/>\n&gt;   <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; thing is clear. You will only be able to cut grooves in your <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;       <br/>\n&gt; sword once.

While you could possibly increase the <br/>\nvelocity with a lighter sword to compensate some, the best result <br/>\nwould come from a combination of both.<br/>\n<br/>\nHistorically, the reason for bo-hi is to reduce battle fatigue <br/>\n(lactic acid build up) from making cut after cut for an extended <br/>\nperiod of time. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nregards,<br/>\nFranco<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com\">nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com</a>, Enore Gardonio &lt;egardon@...&gt; <br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thank you Peter.

I would urge you not to alter your  sword<br/>\n&gt; in the way you are describing. If you want a grooved blade order one or<br/>\n&gt; find one. At the very least you should not do anything until you have had<br/>\n&gt; your blade well shinsa&#39;d.<br/>\n&gt; Still, your question does point up a basic feature of the world of<br/>\n&gt; nippon-to. The values and standards of the various people involved in<br/>\n&gt; Japanese swords are diverse. What is absolutely &quot;wrong&quot; to some is &quot;just<br/>\n&gt; fine&quot; to others. Most of us base our actions on our views of aesthetics and<br/>\n&gt; a sense of historical preservation. There are other values out there and<br/>\n&gt; knowing that helps to understand some of the things we see about swords.<br/>\n&gt; When I was first in Japan I happened to meet a number of sword craftsmen<br/>\n&gt; rather than collectors. Of course this was interesting (heck, it was<br/>\n&gt; wonderful), but it may have given me a skewed view.<br/>\n&gt; 1. The first &quot;smith&quot; I met ( and he was an important artist-and a<br/>\n&gt; wonderful person) was re-tempering some old swords when I visited his<br/>\n&gt; forge.<br/>\n&gt; 2.  An important kinko proudly showed me his portfolio that included some<br/>\n&gt; very excellent &quot;umegane&quot; work he had done. He assured me that &quot;no one could<br/>\n&gt; see&quot; the fillings he had put into some seriously flawed blades.<br/>\n&gt; 3. During a road trip with a fellow who had recently completed his<br/>\n&gt; polishing apprenticeship, we took a long extra trip to let his teacher see<br/>\n&gt; the grooves he was carving on a tanto. He was proud of his work and his<br/>\n&gt; master approved. When I asked why he was doing it, he said &quot;the smith<br/>\n&gt; should have put the grooves in.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; These men are not crooks or villains. Indeed, I think they are great<br/>\n&gt; artists and skilled students, but they operate with a different set of<br/>\n&gt; values.<br/>\n&gt; You certainly can find craftsmen who will do what you ask of them, but one<br/>\n&gt; thing is clear.

            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-550768299\">Enore,<br/>\nI want to second Gordon&#39;s advice. I would urge you not to alter your  sword<br/>\nin the way you are describing. If you want a grooved blade order one or<br/>\nfind one. At the very least you should not do anything until you have had<br/>\nyour blade well shinsa&#39;d.<br/>\nStill, your question does point up a basic feature of the world of<br/>\nnippon-to. The values and standards of the various people involved in<br/>\nJapanese swords are diverse. What is absolutely &quot;wrong&quot; to some is &quot;just<br/>\nfine&quot; to others. Most of us base our actions on our views of aesthetics and<br/>\na sense of historical preservation. There are other values out there and<br/>\nknowing that helps to understand some of the things we see about swords.<br/>\nWhen I was first in Japan I happened to meet a number of sword craftsmen<br/>\nrather than collectors. Of course this was interesting (heck, it was<br/>\nwonderful), but it may have given me a skewed view.<br/>\n1. The first &quot;smith&quot; I met ( and he was an important artist-and a<br/>\nwonderful person) was re-tempering some old swords when I visited his<br/>\nforge.<br/>\n2.  An important kinko proudly showed me his portfolio that included some<br/>\nvery excellent &quot;umegane&quot; work he had done. He assured me that &quot;no one could<br/>\nsee&quot; the fillings he had put into some seriously flawed blades.<br/>\n3. During a road trip with a fellow who had recently completed his<br/>\npolishing apprenticeship, we took a long extra trip to let his teacher see<br/>\nthe grooves he was carving on a tanto. He was proud of his work and his<br/>\nmaster approved. When I asked why he was doing it, he said &quot;the smith<br/>\nshould have put the grooves in.&quot;<br/>\nThese men are not crooks or villains. Indeed, I think they are great<br/>\nartists and skilled students, but they operate with a different set of<br/>\nvalues.<br/>\nYou certainly can find craftsmen who will do what you ask of them, but one<br/>\nthing is clear. You will only be able to cut grooves in your sword once. I<br/>\nurge you to proceed with caution.<br/>\nPeter<br/>\n<br/>\nPeter Bleed<br/>\nProfessor of Anthropology<br/>\n810 Oldfather Hall<br/>\nUniversity of Nebraska<br/>\nLincoln, NE 68588-0368<br/>\n(402) 472-2439<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n                                                                           <br/>\n             &quot;Gordon Robson&quot;                                               <br/>\n             &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:robsongo@...\">robsongo@...</a>.                                             <br/>\n             jp&gt;                                                        To <br/>\n             Sent by:                  &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com\">nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;      <br/>\n             nihontostudy@yaho                                          cc <br/>\n             ogroups.com                                                   <br/>\n                                                                   Subject <br/>\n                                       RE: [nihontostudy] Bo-hi            <br/>\n             12/05/2006 05:16                                              <br/>\n             PM                                                            <br/>\n                                                                           <br/>\n                                                                           <br/>\n             Please respond to                                             <br/>\n             nihontostudy@yaho                                             <br/>\n                ogroups.com                                                <br/>\n                                                                           <br/>\n                                                                           <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHi Enore,<br/>\n<br/>\nAre you talking about taking an antique sword and cutting a groove in it?
