            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1609921894\">Hi Matt,<br/>\n <br/>\nI think the nugui at the end of the polishing process has something to do with colour, and rust inhibition.  I have read somewhere that a blade not treated with nugui will rust more quickly.  Also, nugui, and the mixture of the nugui  by the polisher helps determine the final &quot;colour&quot; of the steel, although the colour of the steel is always there of course  - the nugui just accentuates activities and steel colour among other things.  <br/>\n <br/>\nAs steel, polishers techniques, owner, and environmental conditions differ, I think this is why we see different finishes and finish colours on blades.  I will agree that just about every koto blade that I have seen has a bluish colour to the steel.    And, i dont think that blades with bluish colour to them stopped being producecd as soon as the koto period ended, and vise versa,  I have a shinto blade that has a very pronounced bluish colour to it.  Aging of the steel may also have an effect.<br/>\n<br/>\nLighting may also have an effect on the colour of the steel.  I have a koto wak that looks like it has blackish steel under a compact flourescent bulb, yet looks very bluish under every other light.<br/>\n <br/>\nAlso, care of the blades has an effect on the appearance of the steel and activites and polish in general.  A blade has to be looked after properly, especially in the first few months after a polish.  Applications of uchiko and just general sword maintenace enhance the polish overall.  Water still remains in a blade for a period of time after a polish, so it must be removed, and, like a fine wine, and through uchiko applications a blade ages and we start to see things that werent as obvious as before.<br/>\n <br/>\nJust some thoughts, and I am rambling so I will shut up now.<br/>\n <br/>\nRegards,<br/>\n <br/>\nLouis<br/>\n&quot;Matthew E.
