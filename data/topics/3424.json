            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-21602802\">Barry,<br/>\nI appreciate the comments. My photography was horrible on this one..I<br/>\nhad 5 minutes in bad light. The boshi is intact and healthy. No hagire<br/>\nanywhere. The polish is a nasty semi-amateur job that makes it look<br/>\nworse then it is. The sword is actually very nice. In person, the<br/>\nhamon is clear and has some activity. Lines are sharp and clean.<br/>\nYes..I agree it looks o-surige. Some opinions have been that it is a<br/>\nnagamaki naoshi shortened and reshaped in shinshinto or shinto times,<br/>\nand the inscriptions were done at that time. <br/>\nThey seem to be in the Chinese style of writing, and boast about the<br/>\nsharpness of the sword. Would be very interested in a translation from<br/>\nHarry, as I am told he is familiar with this type of language.<br/>\nThis one you have to hold in hand to appreciate. Nothing fantastic,<br/>\nbut has a nice sugata and nice lines. Fairly thick. I will try next<br/>\ntime to do better shots of the whole blade, and give dimensions.<br/>\nThanks for the comments and views. Much appreciated.<br/>\n<br/>\nBrian<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com\">nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Barry Thomas&quot; &lt;warlord@i...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Dear Blokes (2),<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Barry Thomas wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; It would have been helpful to see the nakago and boshi<br/>\n&gt; &gt; as well to augment &quot;the story&quot; as we need to see a sword in its<br/>\n&gt; &gt; totality, and not just a &quot;selected slice&quot;...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My mouth is open to receive boots of any size...
