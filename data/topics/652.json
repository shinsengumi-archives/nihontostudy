I<br/>\nremember him from the Houston sword shows 20 years ago. What a riot he was.<br/>\nWhen that guy walked in teh room he sort of took over. Bad jokes and teh<br/>\nwhole bit. Fearless. A lot of fun to be around. I spoke to him a few months<br/>\nago and he was weak then. But he survived so long with his desease I<br/>\nunderstand it has not been done before.

At her last sword show--probably in Houston I guess--Ken, who was also struggling and somehow surviving his cancer, had a wonderful &quot;pep-talk&quot; with Kathy that truly helped her to continue her treatments.
