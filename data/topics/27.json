With a small group,<br/>\nmailing out the spreadsheet individually isn&#39;t a problem.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m the owner/moderator, although I&#39;m not running the list in &quot;moderated<br/>\nmode&quot; where I would actually approve posts.  I&#39;m hoping that we can enjoy an<br/>\nopen discussion of swords and fittings here without going crazy.<br/>\n<br/>\nSeveral people have had comments or questions about membership.  When I sent<br/>\nout the email about the list last night, I scrolled through my address book<br/>\nfor the people who I thought might be interested.  If anyone has friends<br/>\nthat are serious about the subject and can play well with others, please<br/>\ninvite them to join.  I don&#39;t want to make this a closed list, but I&#39;d<br/>\nrather not go out and advertise just yet so please hold off with the web<br/>\nlinks for now.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d like to hear any thoughts about how to maintain a successful list --<br/>\njust  be sure to respond off line to me at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jggilbert@...\">jggilbert@...</a> rather<br/>\nthan to the whole list.<br/>\nJim<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Why not just post the excell spreadsheet to the list<br/>\n&gt; so members can get it from there and you don&#39;t have to<br/>\n&gt; keep emailing it to everyone. Just a suggestion..<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Bob R<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; BTW Who&#39;s the moderator for this list? And would said<br/>\n&gt; moderator mind if I posted the link to my website in<br/>\n&gt; the links section? Thought I&#39;d ask first.<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>",
