            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2113156132\">Hi - <br/>\n<br/>\nOne of my favorite articles on menuki was presented in Token Taikai, a booklet containing transcripts of eleven papers presented during the 1976 Token Taikai sponsored by the NCJSC. The late Tom Buttweiler&#39;s artice, &quot;The History of Pre-Edo Menuki&quot; was nicely illustrated and clearly showed the various styles of menuki that evolved during that time-frame in history. That article was a key stimulus that set me off on my fascination with early menuki. This publication would really be a worthwhile one for the NCJSC to consider reprinting one day. If not that, then perhaps the JSS/US could get permission to reprint several of these papers in their newsletter. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnother 2-volume set of books out of Germany several years ago (1995) -- one volume on tsuba, the other on kodogu -- had a pretty good section on menuki. I&#39;m not sure of the formal title to the &quot;set&quot; but it was by H. U. B. Verlag (ISBM 3-931150-00-3). Nice large photographs with the text translated into English, German and Japanese.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn all these years I have seen only one small illustrated article that dealt with the making of menuki. That appeared in a NBTHK Token Bijutsu journal perhaps 15 years ago and showed a modern day menuki maker creating his works. Years later I tried to locate that article to get it translated, but I never did locate it again. Not much written (in depth) about menuki, so it seems. <br/>\n<br/>\nRon<br/>\nSTL<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: David Zincavage <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com\">nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Monday, July 25, 2005 1:44 PM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [nihontostudy] Re: Menuki Thoughts?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Bob McCoy provides the following in an undated  NCJSC fact sheet distributed with an unknown issue of To-Ron.   <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n       References:<br/>\n<br/>\n        1.                 &quot;Menuki, The magnificent Miniatures&quot; By R.B.

I&#39;m<br/>\nnot a fittings guy at all, but wanted a nice pair for a future<br/>\nmounting project, and as an example for study.<br/>\nThey were described as Goto or at least waki-goto. I doubt they are <br/>\nGoto...but am wondering if anyone has any thoughts on the quality,<br/>\nschool etc? Are there any identifying marks on menuki that might lead<br/>\ntowards a certain school?<br/>\nWas really attracted to them because of the fine carving work, and<br/>\ndetail. The colour is a nice dark brownish-black shakudo, not like the<br/>\nlighting in the photo shows.<br/>\nThey are actually nicer than in the pics..with some very fine carving,<br/>\nand detail on the toes, ribs, tail etc. Some odd marks on the<br/>\nlegs..which are 2 ovals with a small dot in the middle.<br/>\nMiddle to late edo I assume? Condition is very good. Any comments from<br/>\n&quot;menuki guys&quot; appreciated.<br/>\n<br/>\nPic is at<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.image-hosting.net/images/messageboard/retalt/Menuki.jpg\">http://www.image-hosting.net/images/messageboard/retalt/Menuki.jpg</a><br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nBrian</div>",
