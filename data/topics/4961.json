Reason I ask, I have a short katana by Shoji Yamon Naokatsu (dated Meiji 4 - 1871) which has a silver habaki with the Tokugawa aoi crest on it in sukashi (pierced). I believe this habaki was original to the sword (not a collector&#39;s replacement) but so far I&#39;ve yet to find some connection between the smith and the Tokugawa. <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\n<br/>\nRon<br/>\nSTL<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
