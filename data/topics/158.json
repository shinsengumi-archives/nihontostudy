Does anyone know of an english index for the book Toko Taikai. I am trying to make sense of the Japanese index but find it faster to search through the kanji by eye.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny guidence would be greatly appreciated. I am expecting to have to learn to read japanese properly before too long.<br/>\n<br/>\ncheers all<br/>\n<br/>\nRich Turner<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
