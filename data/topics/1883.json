I&#39;ve no knowledge of judging this but wonder if it is too loose for Akasaka work, thinking Akasaka would be much finer forging. Again, I&#39;m just thinking out loud and really can not say.

When I see the surface decoration as is in your tsuba, I must admit it shoots me to Nishigaki group. Interesting to compare this treatment of the various Higo groups illustrated in Sasano&#39;s books. <br/>\n<br/>\nExciting tsuba, all!!  Again, sorry for the incomplete earlier email. <br/>\n<br/>\nRon<br/>\nSTL<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Richard Turner <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com\">nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Thursday, May 13, 2004 7:53 AM<br/>\n  Subject: [nihontostudy] Re: Akasaka Tsuba redux<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Hey Ron, thanks for that, I can see the layers on the inside of the<br/>\n  nakago ana, but I am not seeing any bones in the mimi. I had not<br/>\n  considered either Higo or Nishigaki, why points yo uin that direction<br/>\n  ?. My thoughts towards Tosa Myôchin are based on the the iron plate.<br/>\n  It is almost identical to this guard in the way the plate has been forged.<br/>\n<br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://members.westnet.com.au/whiz/richard/pics/Tsuba/kuniyoshi-front.jpg\">http://members.westnet.com.au/whiz/richard/pics/Tsuba/kuniyoshi-front.jpg</a><br/>\n<br/>\n  Thanks again for your help.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Rich<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com\">nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Ron Hartmann&quot; &lt;swords@u...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n  &gt; Hi Rich - <br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt; Yes, nice tsuba. It definitely is kiri, not wysteria motif. If<br/>\n  Akasaka I would expect to see some linear &quot;bones&quot; in the edge of the<br/>\n  tsuba from folding. I can see Akasaka or as you said, Tosa Myochi...or<br/>\n  dare I say Higo, Nishigaki work perhaps?
