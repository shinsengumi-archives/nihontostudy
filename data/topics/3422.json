The<br/>\ncharacters are neither well-cut nor well-balanced, IMHO.  To me this looks like<br/>\na Shinshinto crapper with red lacquer in the kanji!!!   IMHO the kanji are not<br/>\nwell carved, as I said, and the whole thing reeks of a tourist trap to me!!!  At<br/>\nbest it is a genuine Boshin War piece, but the quality doesn&#39;t strike me from<br/>\nthese pics as anything marvellous.  See the two ware evident in the picture, for<br/>\nexample.  Also, the hamon looks weak.  It is always better to have a sword &quot;in<br/>\nthe hand&quot;, but as opinions are being sought on the basis of the pictures I have<br/>\ngiven the best opinion I&#39;m capable of.  It would have been helpful to see the<br/>\nnakago and boshi as well to augment &quot;the story&quot; as we need to see a sword in its<br/>\ntotality, and not just a &quot;selected slice&quot;...  Oh, congratulations to whoever<br/>\nstitched the images together.

            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1803747936\">Hi All,<br/>\nPardon the cross posting on the forums, but I am looking for info on a<br/>\nrather unusual sword.<br/>\nA friend has owned this sword for many years that I quite fancy. Very<br/>\nlong nagasa, and appears to be o-surige. Has an o-kissaki, and well<br/>\ncut naginata-type hi. Nakago looks to be around shinshinto period, but<br/>\njust my novice opinion.<br/>\nWhat is odd about the sword (apart from the fact that it looks like a<br/>\nnagamaki blade made into a katana) is the inscription on the blade on<br/>\nboth sides.<br/>\nSorry for the bad pics. Only had 5 minutes to take these limited pics<br/>\ntoday, and had to do them in segments in bad light. The sword has a<br/>\nbeefy blade, with some weight to it, and the hi are very nicely cut.<br/>\nHamon is not very visible in the pics, but is clearly visible in<br/>\nperson, and quite wide suguha.<br/>\nAnyways, a translation done very long ago supposedly came up with<br/>\nsomething along the lines of &quot;I am so sharp, I can cut clouds&quot; but I<br/>\nhave strong doubts about this.<br/>\nLooking for a translation from anyone please.<br/>\nWhat would the significance of the inscription be, and could it be a<br/>\ngift sword or a dedication, or a commission blade? Fittings are nice<br/>\ntachi mounts, and the blade doesn&#39;t appear to my humble eyes to be a<br/>\njunk sword. Original nagasa would be estimated at well over 28&quot;<br/>\noriginally.<br/>\n<br/>\nA post on another forum gave the following helpful info:<br/>\n&quot;This inscription is most likely a reference to something found in<br/>\nChinese literature or Chinese mythology. I say this because its not<br/>\nmade up of typical Japanese compounds and doesn&#39;t resemble any<br/>\nBuddhist phrases that one typically sees on swords. I think the 3rd<br/>\nand 4th kanji combine to form the word &quot;lightning&quot; in Chinese<br/>\n(somebody correct me if I&#39;m wrong), but the word for lightning in<br/>\nJapanese uses a different kanji. Read kanji-for-kanji as Japanese you<br/>\nend up with a jumble of word roots. The kanji on the left are<br/>\n&#21091;&#20809;&#38275;&#38651;&#38829;&#20992;&#36637;&#30772;&#28014;&#38642;<br/>\nWhen translated it reads; sword, light, lightning (taking the Chinese<br/>\nreading), whip, katana, brilliant, rupture, floating, and cloud. It<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t take much imagination to read this as you have stated in your<br/>\npost (&quot;Lightning-flashing, cloud-rupturing sword&quot;). But as I say its<br/>\nprobably a direct reference to a particular myth or poem, which<br/>\ncontains this exact phrase. The owner would then have the added bonus<br/>\nof appearing quite erudite and well-read in the Chinese classics. I<br/>\nthink samurai were keen on secret societies and this inscription may<br/>\nhave some significance in this context as well. In any event its not a<br/>\nphrase that you would encounter in Japanese, which leads me to believe<br/>\nit&#39;s a Chinese literary reference.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks in advance.<br/>\n<br/>\nBrian<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://img453.imageshack.us/img453/9931/nagamaki1mx.jpg\">http://img453.imageshack.us/img453/9931/nagamaki1mx.jpg</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://img481.imageshack.us/img481/1333/nagamaki36qy.jpg\">http://img481.imageshack.us/img481/1333/nagamaki36qy.jpg</a></div>",
