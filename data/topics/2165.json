            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1585969505\">David, all - <br/>\n<br/>\nThis article by Paul is one of the most inspirational articles I&#39;ve read on collecting and studying swords. When I first saw it back in 1976, I was reluctant to read it, thinking it was simply Paul&#39;s neverending ramblings on. Once I got into it, I was captivated by his observations and thinking with regards to swords as art, and understanding what makes them considered fine art (and why we collect them). Years later, I talked to Paul about this article being reprinted in the JSS/US Newsletter, but he wanted to rewrite it first. As things go, the rewrite never happened. I highly recommend reading this lengthy article, especially the newcomers into this strange field of study we have chosen. If memory serves, Yamanaka called Paul, his &quot;best student&quot; back in those early days. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs to the importance of understanding jitetsu, a wonderful late-night (in the bar) conversation with one of our well-known German collectors drove home the importance this key &quot;point&quot; of kantei. He said initially, he thought he knew everything about the sword, but when taken under the wing of a true authority in Japan (I forget who), and was shown how to look at the jitetsu and then go on from there, that he realized he knew little to nothing up to that point. It was a great conversation and a great lesson in how to approach kantei. <br/>\n<br/>\nRon<br/>\nSTL<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: David Zincavage <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com\">nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com</a> ; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:token_kenkyu_kai@...\">token_kenkyu_kai@...</a> ; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mastersword53777@yahoogroups.com\">mastersword53777@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Tuesday, September 21, 2004 1:00 PM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [nihontostudy] Jitetsu<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Tom, and other correspondents,<br/>\n<br/>\n  I was reading yesterday an old collection of lectures (TOKEN TAIKAI) given<br/>\n  at the NCJSC show in 1976, which I picked up at this year&#39;s SF show.
