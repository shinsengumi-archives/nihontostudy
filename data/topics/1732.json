From what I can see the rust is<br/>\nvery deep.  The fact that it is so deep is not a good thing because a<br/>\npolisher will need to go just as deep to remove it from the sword.  It&#39;s<br/>\nnot about having a soft hand as a polisher; it&#39;s about how deep the rust<br/>\nactually is.  Going that deep in a sword can bring up fukure, shintetsu<br/>\nand other flaws.  Not to mention the fact that the sword&#39;s hamon can<br/>\nalso get softer after going down deep like that.  The nakago was worked<br/>\non in some way, perhaps a false signature was removed?  I don&#39;t know.<br/>\nIn any case to me the sword looks like a Shinto blade but that&#39;s just my<br/>\nhumble opinion.  Now for some good news, it is very possible for swords<br/>\nin this condition to polish out properly and become fine looking swords.<br/>\nBut just take your time, because the expense and risk involved in the<br/>\nrestoration of such a sword is not inexpensive.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nMoses Becerra<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Peter Farrar [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pcfarrar@...\">pcfarrar@...</a>] <br/>\nSent: Wednesday, March 17, 2004 6:42 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com\">nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [nihontostudy] Will this Katana polish?<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nHi,<br/>\n<br/>\nCan anyone give me an opinion if this Katana blade would polish?<br/>\n<br/>\nI believe it to be a shinshinto Katana, the blade (cutting edge 26 <br/>\n1/4&quot;) is very heavy and thick.<br/>\n<br/>\nIts badly corroded and pitted on one side of the blade, the other <br/>\nside has only minor pitting and corrosion.

            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1365038632\">A brief experience of mine in my former criminal life as an amateur <br/>\npolisher (gunto only!).  I had two blades, both Pacific War era, <br/>\nnearly identically rusty (i.e., very rusty, big crusts of red/black <br/>\noxide, hard to see the hamon).  One was a traditionally made blade by <br/>\nMasamura, the other a Showa stamped blade by Kumemune.  As it turned <br/>\nout, the pitting was very shallow on the Kumemune, but very, very <br/>\ndeep on the Masamura, despite the nearly identical appearance on the <br/>\nsurfaces of the two blades.  I couldn&#39;t get all the pitting out of <br/>\nthe Masamura, was just too deep, would&#39;ve had to whittle the blade <br/>\ndown to nothing!  With the Kumemune, I had more work to do to iron <br/>\nout the waves left from the original polish.  Bottom line, you can&#39;t <br/>\ntell by looking (except perhaps if you are a professional polisher).  <br/>\nYou need to determine if it&#39;s worth the expense to have a <br/>\nprofessional evaluate the blade and perhaps open a window to see <br/>\nwhether a full polish is appropriate.  FWIW.<br/>\n<br/>\nNC</div>",

            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2113140301\">Dear Peter,<br/>\nI think anyone looking at these images will tell you that this blade can<br/>\npolish just fine. The shape does not seem to be highly compromised and we<br/>\nhave all seen blades in far worse condition come thru polish to be<br/>\nbeautiful. Before you decide to commit to a polish, however, I think I will<br/>\nnot be the only one to urge you to move slowly.<br/>\nFirst, I&#39;d try to do a bit of kantei. This sure does not look like a<br/>\nshin-shinto to me. If it is as new as you think, then somebody has<br/>\nfalsified the nakago in ways that would make it hard for me to ever &quot;like&quot;<br/>\nthis blade. Its been dummied up and no matter how well it comes thru<br/>\npolish, after a while I suspect that the tang will become hard to over<br/>\nlook. In fact, I bet this is a koto that deserves to be brought back.<br/>\nSecondly, the fact that you cannot see a hamon has to be investigated. A<br/>\nyakiba will typically show even when a blade is in wretched condition. If<br/>\nyou can&#39;t see anything - even tho you look hard - I think you have to<br/>\nassume that the blade has &quot;lost its temper.&quot; In that case, a polish would<br/>\nbe a total waste of your time and money. The good news is that I think your<br/>\nimages DO show a tempered edge. Again, I think the blade deserves<br/>\nrestoration. To be sure, tho, I suggest that this is a prime candidate for<br/>\nhaving a window opened to be sure that it is intact.<br/>\nGood luck<br/>\nPeter Bleed</div>",
