The signature reads Sanjo Munechika saku.<br/>\nFrom the quality of the mounts and etc., I am pretty confident that you have<br/>\na sword manufactured for the export market, typically in Kuwana or some<br/>\nother local area, and then sent to Yokohama to provide an inexpensive, but<br/>\nvery exotic souvenir for some clipper ship crewman and etc. From an artistic<br/>\nand historical level, such swords are not very important. Nonetheless, they<br/>\nmake nice wall hangers. For the veterans, everyone knows who Sanjo Munechika<br/>\nis, so there is no need to explain more, but for the newbies, most of these<br/>\nexport swords have the names  not signatures  of big named smiths. Sanjo<br/>\nMunechika is a Heian period smith who is basically the founder of the<br/>\nYamashiro tradition. This use of big names is sort of like a street artist<br/>\nsigning his chalk rendered Rembrandts with Rembrandts name. No one would<br/>\nmistake this for Munechikas work, it just adds a bit of interest.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nGordon<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com [mailto:nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com] On<br/>\nBehalf Of bh325<br/>\nSent: Saturday, October 14, 2006 12:30 PM<br/>\nTo: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com<br/>\nSubject: [nihontostudy] Re: O-Tanto?<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nCurran,<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you for your reply.

I<br/>\n&gt; would like to find<br/>\n&gt; out as much information as I can about it, I suspect<br/>\n&gt; it may be a WWII<br/>\n&gt; era officer&#39;s weapon or it may be older than that.<br/>\n&gt; The blade polish<br/>\n&gt; has been completely destroyed, and the edge has been<br/>\n&gt; dulled. The tsuba<br/>\n&gt; is tarnished and much of the silver/gold decoration<br/>\n&gt; is missing. What I<br/>\n&gt; know about it:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The blade is between 16-17 inches from end of tang<br/>\n&gt; to tip. It is<br/>\n&gt; curved, but the handle is nearly straight. The<br/>\n&gt; handle itself has been<br/>\n&gt; re-wrapped and re-covered with rayskin, and two<br/>\n&gt; spacers have been<br/>\n&gt; added between the Habaki and the tsuba, and the<br/>\n&gt; tsuba and the handle<br/>\n&gt; collar. These are not original, they look like they<br/>\n&gt; were taken from a<br/>\n&gt; much larger weapon. There is no idication of a<br/>\n&gt; hamon. The Habaki looks<br/>\n&gt; original and is copper, polished on top with<br/>\n&gt; diagonal file marks at<br/>\n&gt; the bottom and on the sides. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The handle collar is copper and is marked with three<br/>\n&gt; symbols, two<br/>\n&gt; characters and a &quot;flower&quot; that is composed of a<br/>\n&gt; central circle and<br/>\n&gt; three semi-circular lobes. The handle cap is horn,<br/>\n&gt; and is original by<br/>\n&gt; my information. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; There are characters chisled into the tang, I<br/>\n&gt; attempted to take a<br/>\n&gt; rubbing but it wasn&#39;t successful. They are only one<br/>\n&gt; one side, but the<br/>\n&gt; reverse side has two small triangular notches near<br/>\n&gt; the top of the tang.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I realize that no one would be able to tell much<br/>\n&gt; from the words, but<br/>\n&gt; maybe someone can inform me on how to best record<br/>\n&gt; and display the<br/>\n&gt; needed markings/information that would allow<br/>\n&gt; identification or any<br/>\n&gt; other information to be determined. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks in advance.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTired of spam?

            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1967870564\">Hello all,<br/>\n<br/>\nI am a new member, I am looking for information on a Japanese edged<br/>\nweapon that was gifted to me rather unexpectedly. I would like to find<br/>\nout as much information as I can about it, I suspect it may be a WWII<br/>\nera officer&#39;s weapon or it may be older than that. The blade polish<br/>\nhas been completely destroyed, and the edge has been dulled. The tsuba<br/>\nis tarnished and much of the silver/gold decoration is missing. What I<br/>\nknow about it:<br/>\n<br/>\nThe blade is between 16-17 inches from end of tang to tip. It is<br/>\ncurved, but the handle is nearly straight. The handle itself has been<br/>\nre-wrapped and re-covered with rayskin, and two spacers have been<br/>\nadded between the Habaki and the tsuba, and the tsuba and the handle<br/>\ncollar. These are not original, they look like they were taken from a<br/>\nmuch larger weapon. There is no idication of a hamon. The Habaki looks<br/>\noriginal and is copper, polished on top with diagonal file marks at<br/>\nthe bottom and on the sides. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe handle collar is copper and is marked with three symbols, two<br/>\ncharacters and a &quot;flower&quot; that is composed of a central circle and<br/>\nthree semi-circular lobes. The handle cap is horn, and is original by<br/>\nmy information. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere are characters chisled into the tang, I attempted to take a<br/>\nrubbing but it wasn&#39;t successful. They are only one one side, but the<br/>\nreverse side has two small triangular notches near the top of the tang.<br/>\n<br/>\nI realize that no one would be able to tell much from the words, but<br/>\nmaybe someone can inform me on how to best record and display the<br/>\nneeded markings/information that would allow identification or any<br/>\nother information to be determined. <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks in advance.</div>",
