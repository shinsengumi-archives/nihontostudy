They were very useful. Doesn&#39;t<br/>\n  anyone happen to know when umegane were developed. I assume that they<br/>\nwould<br/>\n  be an expensive fix these days, but in the days of cheap labor, like say<br/>\n  the Edo period,  might they have been a cheap fix?<br/>\n<br/>\n  Peter Bleed<br/>\n  Associate Dean<br/>\n  College of Arts and Sciences<br/>\n  1223 Oldfather Hall<br/>\n  University of Nebraska<br/>\n  Lincoln, NE 68588-0312<br/>\n  (402) 472-2891<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Hi Peter,<br/>\n<br/>\n  I don&#39;t know if this has been answered yet, but, in general umegane are<br/>\n  always bad, particularly if they are easy to spot. In a blade like this<br/>\n  Fujishima where open, flowing grain in the shinogi-ji is to be expected,<br/>\n  doing an umegane is just silly. The same is true with a very fine omi-yari<br/>\n  I<br/>\n  own that is hugh. It also has a series of rectangular umegane that have<br/>\n  mostly fallen out. The blade is Kanabo and one should expect powerful<br/>\n  running masame that opens up in places in such a work. There is no reason<br/>\n  to<br/>\n  do umegane and now that they are visible and have fallen out, it detracts<br/>\na<br/>\n  great deal from the blade. On the other had, I have a rather nice katana<br/>\n  where the umegane had fallen out. I had it replaced. You can&#39;t see it and<br/>\n  it<br/>\n  looks better now as opposed to the open hole in the skin. So, a case by<br/>\n  case<br/>\n  answer.

            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-92644165\">Hi Peter,<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know if this has been answered yet, but, in general umegane are<br/>\nalways bad, particularly if they are easy to spot. In a blade like this<br/>\nFujishima where open, flowing grain in the shinogi-ji is to be expected,<br/>\ndoing an umegane is just silly. The same is true with a very fine omi-yari I<br/>\nown that is hugh. It also has a series of rectangular umegane that have<br/>\nmostly fallen out. The blade is Kanabo and one should expect powerful<br/>\nrunning masame that opens up in places in such a work. There is no reason to<br/>\ndo umegane and now that they are visible and have fallen out, it detracts a<br/>\ngreat deal from the blade. On the other had, I have a rather nice katana<br/>\nwhere the umegane had fallen out. I had it replaced. You can&#39;t see it and it<br/>\nlooks better now as opposed to the open hole in the skin. So, a case by case<br/>\nanswer. Just my 25 cents worth.<br/>\n<br/>\nGordon<br/>\n  -----Original Message-----<br/>\n  From: Peter A Bleed [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pbleed1@...\">pbleed1@...</a>]<br/>\n  Sent: Friday, July 04, 2003 12:09 AM<br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com\">nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n  Subject: [nihontostudy] umegane-good or bad?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Listeros!<br/>\n        Allow me to once again present the limits of knowledge with a<br/>\n  question that others may find either 1) of interest or  2) answerable.<br/>\n        Yesterday I looked at a &quot;sword&quot; brought home from the Philippines<br/>\nand<br/>\n  owned (proudly) by the nephew of the man who sent it home in 1944.
