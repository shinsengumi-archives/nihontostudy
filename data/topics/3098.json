It is basic but allows<br/>\nviewing at up to 400x but I hardly use any more than 150x - if your image is<br/>\nbeginning to pixellate at 125x then it doesn&#39;t have enough resolution.<br/>\n- PhotoEditor allows one to rotate and crop images for best presentation and<br/>\nviewing so people can concentrate on what you want them to see.<br/>\n- Preserve the original images by renaming any image you manipulate with a<br/>\nmeaningful name. Resave at the highest resolution possible - the jpeg save<br/>\noption in PhotoEditor, for example, should be at 100% to preserve image quality.<br/>\n- I&#39;m a rank amatuer, but if you&#39;re a professional photographer I apologise for<br/>\nthe imposition...<br/>\n<br/>\nFinally, don&#39;t post large file sizes to the list.
