Also the Shonai Shoami did excellent (non-sukashi) work as did Sekibun.<br/>\n<br/>\nJim<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Thanks Jim and Rich.  As for your above comments, I<br/>\nthink I have firmly established what I like.  Seperate<br/>\nfrom these discussed pieces, I am seeking out various<br/>\nother schools from the Mito Shoami type to have a<br/>\nrepresentation of all the schools that used the mantis<br/>\nin their work.  My humble collection of 12 tsuba is<br/>\ngrowing with representation of both kinko and sukashi.<br/>\nI really would love to put out a book one day on just<br/>\nmantis fittings.  Whoever owns that tsuba on the<br/>\nNorthern California site please feel free to leave<br/>\nthat to me in my will.  Given that however, I do like<br/>\nthese Mito tsuba and kinda like the idea of having a<br/>\npotential dai-sho for mounting or at least 1 for<br/>\ndisplay and 1 for mounting.  Thanks again.<br/>\nKen<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
