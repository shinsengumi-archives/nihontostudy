They are of <br/>\na tsuba that I recently acquired in trade. It is in Sasano&#39;s &#39;Early <br/>\nJapanese Sword Guards&#39; as tsuba #208. Sasano has attributed his <br/>\ntsuba to the 3rd generation Kanshiro.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do not know much about distinguishing between the different <br/>\ngenerations of Kanshiro work, and would like to invite open <br/>\ndiscussion of this tsuba. I am curious whether it is an earlier or a <br/>\nlater work and would like to pin it down to within 2 generations.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe tsuba is large with a slight acorn shape to it, meaning that it <br/>\nis slightly asymetric with the widest point being at the hips.<br/>\nWidth there is about 81mm and height is 85 mm.<br/>\n   The shakudo inserts are long, nice shakudo, and asymetrically set <br/>\nwith the right hand one set a few mm higher.<br/>\n<br/>\nThickness is about 3.75 mm at the mimi to about 4mm at the seppa-dai.<br/>\nThe tsuba is very precise and finished.<br/>\n    Thank you in advance,<br/>\n<br/>\nCurran</div>",
