For anyone that doesn&#39;t<br/>\nknow me - perhaps many of you since I&#39;m usually pretty quiet on all the<br/>\nlists I&#39;ve been on since Robert Cole&#39;s first - I am a notorious<br/>\nbibliomaniac, among other obsessions, mostly tsuba these days.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnfortunately I don&#39;t know any special terminology for these<br/>\nboxes-within-boxes except &quot;slipcover&quot; and &quot;shipping box.&quot; When I do get<br/>\nbooks that have the shipping box part (still on used or on new books) I<br/>\narchive them in the attic since they tend to look shoddy on my shelves. It&#39;s<br/>\na very Asian thing, although I have seen them on high-end European art<br/>\nbooks. Is Alan Bale on board here yet? He&#39;s the real pro on books.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor anyone who hasn&#39;t drifted off to sleep through this, what originally<br/>\ncame to my mind was &quot;chitsu,&quot; which is the name of the very Japanese folding<br/>\nbook cover with little ivory (or plastic) tabs that slip into little pockets<br/>\non the spine. Love those.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course I can&#39;t spot my copy of &quot;Studies in Kyo Goto&quot; at the moment, wish<br/>\nthey had put the English on the spine, too. But I did find my copy of &quot;Tsuba<br/>\nno Bi&quot; that was discussed on the other list recently. In fact, I&#39;m pretty<br/>\nsure I have *two* copies of that.<br/>\n<br/>\nBibliomania - a perplexing and tragic affliction.<br/>\n<br/>\nCraig Harris<br/>\n<br/>\nPS - Thanks Jim for giving us a sane refuge.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Jim Gilbert&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jggilbert@...\">jggilbert@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com\">nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, April 23, 2003 7:22 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [nihontostudy] Bob R - Studies in Kyo Goto<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Bob,<br/>\n&gt; No ISBN number, but the name appears in English and Japanese on the front<br/>\n&gt; cover of the book, but not on the spine.
