            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-536612673\">Peter - <br/>\n<br/>\nInteresting that you should ask about Nio school. Last year I purchased three swords to get the one, an O-suriage daito in beat-up shirasaya. My &quot;gut&quot; told me it was quite old -- both sides had been &quot;lightly&quot; buffed but the hamon and jigane could still be seen, sort of. I liked the blade but it puzzled me. I saw Yamashiro things going on but also Yamato indicators. It was basically suguha with slight undulations. Jigane was impressively worked itame but with fine masame running along the ha within the hamon. Nie activity was more ko-nie and showing quality. I was puzzled but hopeful that &quot;whatever&quot; it was, it was quite early work. <br/>\n<br/>\nOnce in Mr. Tanobe&#39;s hands he felt it was &quot;at least&quot; Nambokucho and probably Nio den. It is now polished (but still in Japan awaiting Juyo shinsa) and was papered and attributed to Nio Kiyotsuna which would place it late Kamakura work ca. 1320. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ll send you a copy of my record sheet for this sword although some details might change since I based my information on what I could see before polish. There are other indicators that puzzled me which I noted on my record sheet. Mr. Tanobe reassured me that it is a very fine sword and worth &quot;trying&quot; submitting for Juyo. (But I won&#39;t count my chickens...) <br/>\n<br/>\nInteresting, once I learned it was Nio -- actually, this would place it as &quot;ko-Nio&quot; from what I read -- I discovered in English edition Token Bijutsu,  issue 42, a ko-Nio sword featured in the fold-out section. The description read as if it was describing my sword!!! I was amazed. I&#39;d heard of Nio swords before but only those from much later times (which are not always that good, so I&#39;m told). <br/>\n<br/>\nCheck out the sugata of your sword and study the jigane. If sugata looks &quot;tachi&quot; with small kissaki and you see the mixed jigane, I&#39;d say you might have something there, Professor. <br/>\n<br/>\nRon<br/>\nSTL<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Peter A Bleed <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com\">nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Sunday, May 27, 2007 8:04 PM<br/>\n  Subject: [nihontostudy] Nio School<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Dear List,<br/>\n  For the obvious reasons, . . .

            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1525704708\">Several weeks ago Ivey-Selkerk, our local auction house, sold a massive sized (in thickness) naginata with niji-mei, Yasutsugu. Several of the boys were kind of interested but I discouraged this since it sounded like such an odd-ball thing and the mei was definitely not reliable. (I never did go look at it pre-sale.) Another local fellow ended up winning it (for much too much, in my opinion) and today was my first chance to actually see this thing in-hand. (I&#39;m told it weighs over 5 lbs.)<br/>\n<br/>\nMy question here is, does anyone know why such a blade as this was even made? <br/>\n<br/>\nThe blade measures 24.4&quot; inches with a short nakago of 9.7&quot; more or less. The unfinished nakago (no file marks and kind of &quot;bar stock&quot; looking) measures 0.6&quot; thickness at the munemachi. The nakago is signed as I said but is really not &quot;finished&quot; in any professional manner. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe blade is forged and has a hamon -- I still need to sit down with this, but not today -- and you do see a couple small ware in places. The  saya and pole are as expected; massive. These look very &quot;shinshin-to&quot; or &quot;Meiji&quot; to my eye. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis was definitely not a weapon to be used. We wondered if it was for an offering but even if that, one would think the nakago would had been finished better. Anyone ever find anything out about this kind of thing and what they were made for??? <br/>\n<br/>\nInteresting, sort of, but I&#39;m glad I did not put my money into it. I believe it sold around mid-$3k or so after commission and sales tax. <br/>\n<br/>\nRon<br/>\nSTL<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
