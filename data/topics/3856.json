Some of you might have <br/>\nmeet Dr. Louis Belschner a Dentist from Denver Colorado in the last few <br/>\nyears at one of the sword shows as he was selling off his collection.  &lt;&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\nDr. Belschner passed away late last year and the family has ask me to <br/>\nsell his remaining swords, tsuba and books. &lt;&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\nDr. Belschner was a good friend and I always had a good time when I <br/>\nvisited him in Denver. Over the last 25 years I have bought a number of <br/>\nblades from him and he bought a number of blades from me.  One of the <br/>\nfirst blades I bought from him was a nice shin-shinto with dragon <br/>\nhorimono.  At the time he wanted $500 cash for the blade.  And I sure <br/>\nwanted that blade.  I had to call my wife and talk her into wiring me <br/>\nthe cash as I did not have that amount.  It took all day but I walked <br/>\naway with the blade very happy.  The blade was in good polish to my very <br/>\nbeginning eyes but I could not understand why there were dips in the <br/>\nblade between the large gunome.  Turns out that he had used his dental <br/>\ntools to clean up the blade and the softer metal above the hamon was <br/>\nremoved faster than the hardened edge.  I wonder what happened to that <br/>\nblade after I sold it? &lt;&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you would like a list of items that I have to sell please email me at <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jswords@...\">jswords@...</a> &lt;mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jswords@...\">jswords@...</a>&gt; . &lt;&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for your time<br/>\nDavid McDonald<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nDavid McDonald                  Collector of Japanese Swords and Old Iron <br/>\nPO Box 265                      WEB page - <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.montanairon.com\">http://www.montanairon.com</a> <br/>\nSidney MT  59270                email - <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jswords@...\">jswords@...</a> <br/>\n406-482-3243  evenings          I do tsukamaki (wrapping of sword hilts) <br/>\n<br/>\nOwner of White IH Cub & Super A Farmall, IH 100 & 130, 140, AC G  <br/>\nMcD type M, Monitor, Frost King and other stationary engines. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\nYahoo!
