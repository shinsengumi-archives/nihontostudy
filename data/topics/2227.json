            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1621594028\">Uttori is a technique where the metal foil was attached without soldering by crimping/staking/pushing the edges of the gold or silver around the &quot;design&quot; into the base metal.  It was popular in the Muromachi and Momoyama periods and then died out rather abruptly.  The problem with uttori is that once the foil is worn through in a spot there is nothing to stop the edges from being peeled back and the foil pulled away from wear.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe uttori technique was replaced by various iroe technologies where the metal foils were attached to the base by soldering or other &quot;glue&quot; techniques.  It wears better, but it isn&#39;t quite as beautiful as uttori to those of us who like the old stuff.  Most iroe gold isn&#39;t as thick as uttori, perhaps because it doesn&#39;t have to be so strong to withstand the forming and crimping (and thick is expensive).  Still, some iroe can be rather thick, so the distinction in the technique is in how the foil is attached rather than the thickness.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is a series to be found in Goto, Waki Goto, Kyo Kinko and Kyo Kanagushi.  Uttori would point toward Ko-Goto (pre Edo Goto).  The quality of the base metal is one key in differentiating the levels -- true black shakudo at one end grading into a brown alloy at the other. The quality of the carving is of course very important as is that of the inlay.  It is all case by case as many people at different levels copied and modified classic Goto motifs.<br/>\n<br/>\nJim<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nInteresting to read more about these terms. Going back again to the very minute-sized shakudo dragon menuki that received &quot;Kyo-kanagushi&quot; in Chicago. What had me thinking they might be, shall I say...higher quality (?)...was the use of gold utori on the (male&#39;s) tail and the wiskers. It surprised me to think they (Kyo-kanagushi/late Edo anybody) did utori work. Utori overlay always makes me think Momoyama. Anything worth expanding on here? Just curious.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",

Fitting out an entire koshirae in that motif is a bit over the top.  I suppose that there is a chance that it was put together for an early Western buyer, but that example didn&#39;t strike me as a typical export item.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m speculating, but that koshirae doesn&#39;t seem like mainstream merchant or bushi wear.  It may be more of a gangster or gambler item, or something that someone from another class would wear to pretend while out on the town.  Maybe an equivalent of the mid-late 20th C American biker aesthetic as co-opted by upper-middle-class-baby-boomer Harley owners.    <br/>\n<br/>\nThere are people on this list who have spent a lot more time on late Edo period social history that I have -- any other ideas???<br/>\n<br/>\nJim<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Thanks Jim, I&#39;ll make note of this info and also pass it on to my friend who owns that &quot;skull&quot; sword.

Also most of the gomoku zogan and mukade<br/>\nstyles, the inlay or wire is a later addition. I&#39;m sure<br/>\nmany other examples could be cited.
