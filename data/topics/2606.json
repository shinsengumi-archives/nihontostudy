            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-372212780\">Milt,<br/>\nAgreed that the sukashi design looks like Kyo-Shoami, but that type would usually be decorated with nunome zogan.  Given the type of &quot;true inlay&quot; on your guard it would probably be attributed to Heianjo.  Your description of a silvery sheen made me think of fire scale, but the close up photos show a heavy layer of wax on the surface.  If it still looks metallic in person, it may be scale.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is no sahari there, despite the auction description.  I see only brass.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are some types of guard that are found as iron sukashi only, along with other versions of the same sukashi ground decorated with Shoami-style nunome zogan and yet other examples of the same type of plate decorated with Heianjo-style hira zogan.  I suspect that these were not the products of separate &quot;schools&quot; but rather different levels of trim that could be ordered according to taste and budget.  The decoration might have been done &quot;in house&quot; or subcontracted out to specialists.<br/>\n<br/>\nJim<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  For your convenience..........<br/>\n<br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://tinyurl.com/2voxv\">http://tinyurl.com/2voxv</a><br/>\n<br/>\n  Iron tsuba , katana size  with brass/copper inlay outlining the <br/>\n  flower and leaves.
