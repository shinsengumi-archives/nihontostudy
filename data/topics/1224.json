They want to buy your item <br/>\nfor<br/>\n&gt; less than it is worth, and if you ask a fair price few will go to<br/>\n&gt; you. They will flock to those that appear to be offering discounted<br/>\n&gt; items though, often times cutting deals outside of ebay, and all <br/>\nthey do<br/>\n&gt; is screw themselves. Their own greed means they end up with these<br/>\n&gt; valueless pieces of junk. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Even armed with a little information, if they see someone who <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; appear to know what they&#39;re selling, how many of them send an <br/>\nemail and<br/>\n&gt; say, &quot;Hey dude, that junky violin you found in your grandpa&#39;s <br/>\nattic is<br/>\n&gt; really a Stradivarius. You should get it authenticated and sell it <br/>\nat<br/>\n&gt; Sotheby&#39;s, pay off your mortgage and be able to send your kid to a <br/>\ngood<br/>\n&gt; university.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Very few.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So when you go out of your way to inform them, often times you <br/>\ntake away<br/>\n&gt; the mystery and the treasure hunting mentality takes them<br/>\n&gt; elsewhere. Right into the hands of the scammers.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; They want to buy something from you of extreme value, and not pay <br/>\nfor<br/>\n&gt; it. So they find someone who looks like they&#39;re providing this to <br/>\nthem. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s not only with swords, but it&#39;s with diamonds... other <br/>\ngemstones,<br/>\n&gt; watches, everything. I sold some gold coins once, and I had no end <br/>\nof<br/>\n&gt; people offering to do me a favor and give me 20% *less* than the <br/>\nmarket<br/>\n&gt; price of gold if I would sell to them now and end the auction.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Gold is the one thing that has a well understood value in the <br/>\nworld, and<br/>\n&gt; even on ebay auctions will end at the market price of gold<br/>\n&gt; consistently. The price of gold is less a reflection on the value <br/>\nof<br/>\n&gt; gold then it is on the value of paper money. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; These people were effectively offering me 80 cents if I would give <br/>\nthem<br/>\n&gt; a dollar bill. There is no mentality there for a fair deal, just a <br/>\nhope<br/>\n&gt; that they can get something for less than it is valued.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; For both reasons above, junk will continue to be put on ebay and <br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; auctions will be well attended. People will buy first and ask <br/>\nquestions<br/>\n&gt; later.
