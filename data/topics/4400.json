Haynes. &quot;Right On&quot;! <br/>\n<br/>\nRobert states &quot;All of the large group meetings held in the West, for <br/>\nthe collectors of swords and fittings, are not of an intellectual <br/>\nnature but almost purely of a material dealer/merchant nature; this has <br/>\nbeen so for over forty years.&quot; Does that hit home or what? I will have <br/>\nmy second show of attendance this coming weekend.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope to attend all of the lectures, it&#39;s the only way to continue my <br/>\neducation. I have to admit, I will have a table this year. I will have <br/>\nTsuba (I went overboard collecting tsuba), sword bags and stands (for <br/>\ntsuba and swords) for sale. All of my items for sale are &#39;Hand Made&#39;. <br/>\nBut my intention is not to attend shows to sell. I want to attend shows <br/>\nto LEARN.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I hope to meet Robert E. Haynes and tell him &quot;I agree, there are <br/>\ntoo many in this field who are only business oriented.&quot;</div>",
