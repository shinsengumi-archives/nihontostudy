By round, I was picturing a rounded maru mimi, not a round cross section.  A round cross section is not typical for early Akasaka guards.  Later when the Akasaka were copying Higo work, they used their thinner style of round section rim.  I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve seen this kind of rim on an Akasaka piece, but I can&#39;t say it&#39;s impossible.  They did some unusual things.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I&#39;m not sure about your piece.  The looseness of the sukashi design reminds me of early Akasaka, although the bird at the top is pretty thick for them.  The iron surface shows more &quot;modulation&quot; that is typical for Akasaka.  It looks more like something from the Owari region.  The seppa dai is not far from Akasaka shape.  The guard reminds me a little of a third generation piece that I have:<br/>\n<br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://home.earthlink.net/~jggilbert/akasaka.htm\">http://home.earthlink.net/~jggilbert/akasaka.htm</a>  (second guard down from the top).<br/>\n<br/>\n  Looking inside the sukashi openings do you see any signs of three layer construction?<br/>\n<br/>\n  Tough one... it&#39;s bugging me already.  Some Akasaka style, but a lot that is not.  And I don&#39;t know what the &quot;is not&quot; part is.  Thinking out loud...<br/>\n<br/>\n  Jim<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    Thanks Jim,<br/>\n    Yes I did intend to attach a photo, sorry I might get the hang of technology in another 30 or 40 years. I have put the image in the album (I think) under paulb. Please take a look and let me know if its there and what you think.<br/>\n    many thanks<br/>\n    paul<br/>\n<br/>\n    Jim Gilbert &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jggilbert@...\">jggilbert@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n    Paul,<br/>\n    A thick, round rim is typical for early Akasaka guards.  Later ones tend to be thinner.  The early Akasaka really favored a very &quot;high,&quot; rounded rim compared with other groups working at the same time.<br/>\n<br/>\n    Sometimes tekkotsu are seen in early examples.  Senkotsu is more common, which is a sort of long linear bone that forms where the inner and outer plates are joined.  <br/>\n<br/>\n    I&#39;m not sure if you intended there to be an attached photo.

It&#39;s quite easy.<br/>\n<br/>\n    Jim <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      Dear All,<br/>\n      I have been discussing the tsuba below with a number of friends from both this and another group. The concensus to date is that this is early Akasaka. While I am more than content with that attribution I was wondering how common the thick round mimi was in Aakasaka work? Also there are a lot of bones in the mimi. I understand that early Akasaka work was influenced by Owari tsuba, is this an example of this? or should I be looking in another direction.<br/>\n      All comments greatly appreciated.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      ---------------------------------<br/>\n      Want to chat instantly with your online friends?
