I bought this sword the 21th. of february 2004, <br/>\n  payed it but never received it. By request I received several other <br/>\n  photos of the sword and the NBTHK papers as well as copies from his <br/>\n  passport and driverslicense. This information is avaible for the <br/>\n  list if you don´t find it inconvenient. Look well at this sword on <br/>\n  ebay and take care of wolflady 137 and jnetweb as well as John <br/>\n  Pivec, Minneapolis, USA. This sword will without any doubt be put <br/>\n  for sale again. If anyone has this sword in their possession, please <br/>\n  let me know. I will award informations which will place the sword at <br/>\n  my house with 1000 U.S.dollars. If the Nihonto study group find it <br/>\n  appropiate I will put photos of the sword as well as John Pivecs <br/>\n  passport and driverslicense, on the list. <br/>\n  The Danish Criminal Police, The Danish Foreign Ministry and the USA <br/>\n  Police are involved in the investigation and I have asked ebay to <br/>\n  help with information as well.<br/>\n  Thankyou for your help in advance<br/>\n  All the best<br/>\n  Allan<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!
