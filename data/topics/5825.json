The burglar will likely try to sell the stolen items.   <br/>\n&gt; So, please be on the look-out for any of the following items.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  - Two Yasunori katana.  One was dated Showa 18, is an unusually  <br/>\n&gt; long 27 inches (the normal length is 26 inches, and is in Type 98  <br/>\n&gt; military mounts with family crests (mon).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  - A Yasutoku katana dated Showa 15, is 26 and 1/4 inches long, and  <br/>\n&gt; is in Type 98 military mounts with family crests.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  - An Awataguchi Tadatsuna wakizashi with a 21 inch cutting edge.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  - A mounted Enju school katana approximately 30 inches long.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  - A late World War II Type 44 green scabbard.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  - A military gunto blade that was in the process of polishing.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  - Three or four Type 98 military mounts with tsunagi (wood filler  <br/>\n&gt; blades).  One of the mounts, unusually, had copper fittings.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  - A koto Morimitsu tachi approximately 28 inches long, ubu (the  <br/>\n&gt; tang has not been shortened).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  - An unsigned koto Kamakura tachi with a hi (groove).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  - Several gold-inlayed menuki.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The burglary occurred on Monday June 13 at approximately 9:30 a.m.   <br/>\n&gt; The burglar was driving a navy blue pick-up truck.  Evidence  <br/>\n&gt; indicates the burglar was not knowledgeable about swords.  Again,  <br/>\n&gt; please be on the look-out for any of these items.
