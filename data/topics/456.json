Look at menuki nos. 98 and 104. I believe both are by Somin (#104 being appraised by Soyo???). I&#39;ve no idea if the description of these menuki make mention of this style of root or not, but I doubt it. Not sure this proves anything except that Somin used this form of root. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&quot;Rootless&quot; posts were also popular with machibori kinko during this (later Edo) time.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Often wondered about that, too, and thinking about it, do recall that many &quot;lesser&quot; menuki do seem to be without &quot;roots.&quot; This seems to go along with them being rather &quot;flat&quot; and often thick and sloppy side-walls.

Dean Hartley was another ko-kinko person. Today, I rely on Bob Haynes and you, Jim. I should add Gordon to that list, knowing his interest in ko-anything. So what I am saying is that just about anything &quot;factual&quot; that anybody can add to this type of discussion is worthwhile. There is (seems to be) so little written about it, to my knowledge. <br/>\n<br/>\nRon<br/>\nSTL<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Jim Gilbert <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com\">nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Tuesday, August 10, 2004 7:48 PM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [nihontostudy] menuki question<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Hi Ron,<br/>\n  I have seen them a fair number of times, but never thought about a pattern behind it.  As far as my memory can be trusted, I think that it&#39;s a mid to late Edo period thing.  I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve seen it on Goto work, only machibori.  Those machibori examples have been by fairly big names.  I don&#39;t know of any school pattern or lineage behind it, but there could well be one (or maybe it was just a fashion).  <br/>\n<br/>\n  I have the sense that it&#39;s often seen along with tanzaku mei (the signatures done on small plaques), but I don&#39;t know of any reason for that.  I don&#39;t think that I&#39;ve seen the star piece soldered down like a true root.  It seems more like it is there to cover up the joint between the post and the back of the menuki.  (&quot;Rootless&quot; posts were also popular with machibori kinko during this time.)  Maybe it is soldered down but the solder is kept away from the edges.  If someone was out to create a forgery from scratch it&#39;d be pretty easy to add these to enhance the fake if appropriate.  If just putting on a gimei or inserting a gimei tanzaku I don&#39;t know if the faker would bother with it.<br/>\n<br/>\n  That&#39;s all I can think of right now and without doing research on it.  Does anyone know of any specific examples contradicting the above or of an existing analysis that explains what they&#39;re all about?<br/>\n<br/>\n  And yes, Shozui is the usual romanization.

I also have a large pair of &quot;running boar&quot; menuki signed Shozui which have the same star-shape roots. Not holding out that these are correct as signed, but I have seen this thing on at least one pair of menuki by Shozui (am I spelling this right?). Any comment on the use of this star-shape roots? Characteristic of any era or maker? Just curious. <br/>\n<br/>\nRon<br/>\nSTL<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Jim Gilbert <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com\">nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Tuesday, August 10, 2004 5:50 PM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [nihontostudy] menuki question<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Milt,<br/>\n  They&#39;d probably be attributed to Edo Kinko.
