            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-723873873\">Hi Ron,<br/>\nThey look like Ezo type menuki to me.  The beak is a trunk.  Elephants appear in Buddhist art from quite early times and are often rendered rather unrealistically.  But, since these have the shishi-like fringes of hair they probably represent baku, a mythical chimera.<br/>\n<br/>\nJim<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Hi all - <br/>\n<br/>\n  I&#39;ve just placed photos (front/back) of a pair of interesting menuki in the Yahoo album which, I hope, the below link will show to you:<br/>\n<br/>\n    <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://tinyurl.com/2sudo\">http://tinyurl.com/2sudo</a><br/>\n<br/>\n    These came off a rather nice, large katana that I just sold to a friend a couple weeks ago. Many of you will recall the discussions that went on years ago (Tom Buttweiler days) regarding Ezo menuki. <br/>\n<br/>\n    This pair could very well fit the bill for Ezo, but I don&#39;t know. They are rather thin base material and are fairly large, measuring 49 mm (1.9&quot;), thereabout. They do not have posts. The base material could be a yamagani and has the &quot;worn&quot; gold wash that Ezo display. <br/>\n<br/>\n    The other question regarding these menuki, what motif are they representing? The creature appears to have the body of a shishi but the face of a beaked tengo. Anybody have an answer to this?<br/>\n<br/>\n    Interesting menuki that hmmmm, should had maybe stayed with the other &quot;Hartmann menuki&quot;...oh well. <br/>\n<br/>\n    Ron<br/>\n    STL<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
