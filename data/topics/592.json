In pretty much any area of antique collecting in the West where an<br/>\nappraiser was writing up a piece featuring a several hundred year old false<br/>\nsignature, the Western appraiser would simply describe the piece and note<br/>\nhis rejection of the signature as invalid and proceed to make his own<br/>\nattribution. His description would include note of the false signature, and<br/>\nhis assumption would be that a clear written description, especially one<br/>\naccompanied by a picture, would be entirely adequate to remove the<br/>\npossibility of anyone being misled.  The false signature&#39;s perfidy, once<br/>\nrecognized in the light of contemporary scholarship would be considered<br/>\nhistoric, and consequently, merely interesting and amusing, rather than a<br/>\ncontinuing active offense.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf a modern American organization were evaluating Japanese swords, and the<br/>\ncase of an ancient gimei came along, what we would expect is papers to be<br/>\nissued simply noting that the signature is false and making a different<br/>\nattribution.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne significant difference between antique furniture and Japanese swords<br/>\ndoes come to mind:  it is a good deal easier distinquish American furniture<br/>\nmakers and schools than to appraise Nihonto.  Yet, inevitably, mistakes<br/>\noccur, and sometimes opinions and evaluations change.  The Japanese approach<br/>\nof gimei removal and nakago repatination is based on the assumption that<br/>\nthis shinsa committee&#39;s judgement this day is 100% correct and could never<br/>\never be reversed.  Now some gimei are doubtless unquestionably what they<br/>\nare.  I own a Mino-den tanto signed Masamune, which has no possibility<br/>\nwhatsoever of being a Masamune.  But I&#39;m sure not all cases are as clear.<br/>\nIn most areas of conservation and collecting, irreversible changes to a<br/>\npiece would always be avoided.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\nFrom: &quot;fd&quot; &lt;nagamaki@...&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;token_kenkyu_kai@...&gt;<br/>\nSent: Sunday, July 20, 2003 12:28 AM<br/>\nSubject: Re: Gimei removal and Nakago Repatination<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;      With one exception I have no problem with the point of view regarding<br/>\n&gt; signature removal or non-removal.

I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; think something to keep in mind here is &quot;where are you<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; going with your restoration project?&quot;  I have learned<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that hard way that Japanese-like is really not the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; same as Japanese, and, of course, the worst place to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; learn this kind of lesson is at shinsa.  Because<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; everybody tends to want to dump pieces (as much or<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; more koshirae as swords) which don&#39;t paper, I find<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; there is a general reluctance to talk about the whole<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; restoration process in the context of what I might<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; label as &quot;external&quot; or &quot;Japanese market&quot; valuations of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;sword stuff&quot; (so we can encompass just blades, just<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; fittings, fitting sets, and fully mounted blades).<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   If all you want to do is have a katana-like thing<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; with which to practice iaido, then you might be better<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; off with an iaito from Tozando.  Where things start to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; get blurry is when you have to use a &quot;real&quot; shinken.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Many of who didn&#39;t get into the sword market early or<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; wisely enough to buy good Nihonto when they were more<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; plentiful and less expensive will migrate from replica<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; type things which are not Japanese swords at all to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; gunto re-mounted buke-zukuri style.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;    Nothing wrong with that.  In fact for a tamesh-giri<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; blade I would argue that is a good thing, because it<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; avoids the possibility of damaging a blade with<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; artistic and historical value.  However, as Chris can<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; easily explain to you, &quot;gunto&quot; actually pertains to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the mounts and there are swords from the Second World<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; War which were made using traditional materials and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; methods and trashing one of these blades would be as<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; unfortunate as wrecking an older blade.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;    The other thing is that if you are a martial<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; artist, things can easily get a bit blurry over time.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; You can get conceptually sloppy, not be as serious<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; about your collecting and restoration as you are about<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; your practice.  The result is often a lot of small<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; investments because you cannot afford the larger ones,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; only to look back a decade or so later and realize<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that all of those little purchases which generally<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; amount to little or no cumulative value, were they<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; simply done at one time, would have gotten you a fine<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; sword in serviceable, collectable Edo period mounts.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;    Admittedly, not everything that is collectable is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; suitable for use - much of it should be relegated (or<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; delegated) to pure connoisseurship, and if you have a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; blade which is a real &quot;work horse&quot;, you need several<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; expert opinions if you want a blade which is (a)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; authentic (b) safe (c) not likely to be damaged by<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; practice.  Having said all that, I had a very<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; interesting experience recently which only reinforces<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; my feeling that wherever it is even remotely feasible,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; you should at the very least aspire to having the real<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; thing and not follow what has been aptly described to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; me as &quot;blind alleys&quot; of restoration.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;    I picked up a blade here in New Hampshire about 4<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; years ago from a local dealer.  It was part of a trade<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I was working out with a guy who was going to do some<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; paintings for me.  He wanted a koto blade in pretty<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; good polish, so it took a while to find him something<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; which would meet his criteria.  Eventually one of the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; guys here turned up an O-suriage ni-shaku blade with a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; very bad gimei of &quot;Nagamitsu&quot; but which while somewhat<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; tired had a pleasantly bright habuchi, good hataraki<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and the &quot;blue&quot; of good Kyushu steel which comes not<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; from Nugui but from some particular combination of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; alloys which Barry Hennick, Roger Robertshaw or Rich<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Stein could explain better than could I. In any case,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I had figured it for maybe Higo Enju, seems that it is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; actually Yamato ko-Naminohira (Kyushu branch of Yamato<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; den).<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;    Anyway, the guy for whom I bought the blade didn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; care about the gimei, among other things because he<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; can&#39;t read signatures and while he has a lot of swords<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (many times the number I have) he doesn&#39;t really care<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to know too much about them.  In the end our art deal<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; didn&#39;t work out and the blade in shirasaya came back<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to me.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;    It&#39;s not of a size for me to be swinging around<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; much (my Japanese students all want it, and they can&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; have it but that&#39;s a different story) but while it&#39;s a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; tired old warhorse, it does have about 600 years of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; age on it, and I felt some intrinsic resonance with<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the blade.  This is all personal, subjective stuff,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; but without that stuff, I fear few of us would<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; collect.  Since I decided to keep the blade, I sent it<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to Cary to have the gimei removed.  Chris Bowen has<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; guys in Japan who can do that for you as well.  The<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; thing is that a professional mei removal is well worth<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the expense, because if done right, and if the nakago<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; is properly repatinated/filed (the older the blade,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the less filing that needs to be done, but the more<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; complex and difficult the process of matching the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; existing texture is) then the blade is, in fact,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; RESTORED to what should have been its natural<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; condition.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;    I would argue this goes for mounting blades as<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; well.  If you are just looking for something to swing<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; in class, then you might be concerned about safety or<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; price first.  Do yourself a favor and don&#39;t confound<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; this with authenticity.  There are a variety of views<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; about why one would learn the Japanese sword arts and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; at one end of the spectrum you have the argument that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; if you are going to accurately preserve the art, then<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; you should use the actual weapons in their actual<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; amounts (I can see Clive Sinclair having a heart<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; attack as he reads this, so let me qualify that by<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; saying you should also have someone who knows better<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; than you do advise you on what blades are suitable for<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; various kinds of practice and which blades should not<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; be handled in any way other than as rare<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; collectables).<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; At the other end, you have guys ordering perfectly<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; serviceable blades from makers either here or in Japan<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; who specialize in making weapons pretty much for every<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; level and type of martial arts practice that you could<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; envision.  If you&#39;re a martial artist, you eventually<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; need to unbundle or &quot;unblur&quot; these distinctions and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; figure out what blade or blades you want or need, what<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; they are and for what purpose are you collecting them.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; As a point of principle I would say that the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; non-martial artist needs to do this (hopefully sooner<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; rather than later - which is where study comes in) as<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; well.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;    A good experience for me has been the restoration<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; on this Naminohira katana.  We really started from<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; somewhere around &quot;less than zero&quot;.  An old blade in a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; fairly inexpensive shirasaya, gimei and no other<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; fittings.  After Cary removed the bad mei and while we<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; were waiting for the nakago repatination (it takes a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; few weeks) I sent him some tsuba for possible mounting<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; pieces.  He picked out a Heianjo piece, not too far<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; removed in time from when the blade was made and used<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that as the centerpiece from which to assemble and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; restore period koshirae.  Admittedly, I have a bit of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; an advantage here because knowing me, Cary could<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; assemble mounts which in his words reflected both the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; spirit of the tsuba (as the centerpiece of the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; koshirae) and the personality of the owner.  That&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; just a bonus issue for me.  What is more important is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that when I got the blade back, the whole package<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; possessed the kind of harmony and authenticity you<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; would immediately recognize as literally &quot;museum<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; quality&quot;.  It&#39;s a nice (if rather tired) late 14th<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; century blade in early-mid edo mounts &quot;en-suite&quot; fully<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; restored, yet looking as if the whole package had been<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; sitting in someone&#39;s home as a family treasure,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; mounted just as you see it, for the last three or four<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; hundred years.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;    That&#39;s what I would call true &quot;restoration&quot;.  It&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; not just &quot;mounting up&quot; a blade (for practice or<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; display) but is the process of creating an artistic<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; whole which is demonstrably (the visual impact is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; basically &quot;wow&quot;, particularly if you know how this<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; piece started out) more than the sum of its parts.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;    The last fifty years of sword collecting (if not<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; much of the last five hundred years) seem to be<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; characterized by a kind of dealers&#39; reverse mentality<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (I had a blade at one time which had been messed with<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; during the Edo period to look like a Heian piece, so I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; know from experience that this kind of messing with<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; blades has been going on for long and long) where the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; parts are worth more broken up than they are as an<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; artistic whole.  While that might be economically true<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (and as often as not it&#39;s even a bad economic<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; decision) it&#39;s an artistic travesty.  Another thing I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; did this month was manage to re-unite a Dai-Sho tsuba<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; set which had been separated at least a hundred years<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ago.  One piece wound up in Canada and from there made<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; its way to the U.S.  The other piece was in an<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; European collection.  Neither owner even knew that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; their tsuba was part of a matched pair.  I can only<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; speculate about what the swords and the other fittings<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; might have been like (pretty good, I imagine if they<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; still exist).<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;    It is so easy in collecting to unknowingly and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; unintentionally destroy, it is rare and difficult to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; rejuvenate, recover and restore.  And as Chris has<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; been telling us for years, restoration means a whole<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; lot more than sending that rusty &quot;junker&quot; to an<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; amateur polisher and then cobbling together enough<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; bits and pieces of tosogu to create a mounted piece.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   Admittedly, it might not matter to some people<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; wether they are creating or destroying and they are<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; more concerned about what they have (and how cheaply<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; they got it) than they are about their piece having<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; any kind of artistic integrity.  I had a very<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; frustrating experience of this sort a few years ago.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I had acquired (and still have) a very good Mito<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; school sentoku tsuba (at least Ogawa Morihiro sensei<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; said it was a very good Mito piece) and while I was<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; visiting David Hamilton in New Mexico, he was wrapping<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; a tsuka for a local gun dealer, which happened to have<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the identical (we can talk microscopic level here<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; folks, I mean identity as in exact congruence not<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; relative similarity) fuchi kashira (pretty obviously<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; all disassembled from the same sword).  We tried<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; everything we could think of to get those pieces back<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; together - offered him the tsuba way below market -<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; offered to by the fuchi-kashira way above market and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; pay for a new handle for him - all in vain.  He just<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; wanted his piece and that was it.  Where it came from<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; or where it was going was none of our business. Once<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; humpty dumpty falls apart, reassembly is often<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; difficult if not impossible.  As Stephen King says,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;you can&#39;t unring the bell&quot;.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   So if you have a blade you are thinking about<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; mounting or re-mounting, I would urge you to do it<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; right the first time.  You have two guys easily to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; hand - Cary in San Francisco and Chris in Japan, both<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; web accessible (http://www.ikkyudo.com and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; http://www.ejapaneseswords.com) who specialize in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; precisely what I&#39;ve been describing - restoration<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; which is an act of art and an act of creation.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Between the two of them their specializations are<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; different enough that I regard them as complementary<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; rather than competitive.  Of course, the older guys on<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the list know this already.  If you know Brian<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Tsernaga (sp?) or John Tirado and can get into their<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; schedule, they are active participants in the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; authentic restoration process. But for the rest of us,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; it&#39;s a lot easier to go to one guy who has built a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; career specializing in authentic blades and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; restoration than to chase down all the individual<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; pieces.  Different strokes.  When I was collecting<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; gunto, Fred Lohman&#39;s service was perfect for me, and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; if you&#39;re mounting an oil-tempered gunto he&#39;s still<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the guy to go to.  If you want a traditional blade<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; made with traditional materials and methods then go to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Chris, who has modern blades covered, beginning with<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the opening of the Tatara in 1933 right through the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; current works of the Gassan school, or to Cary who<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; specializes in older blades, Juyo Token and blades of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Juyo quality which for relatively small reasons<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (sometimes nonsensically small from my point of view)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; didn&#39;t get a Juyo paper and so trade in the market at<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; a quarter of the price of their indistinguishable<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; counterparts.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;     As Mike Blue, Bill Latham, Mutsyhr Yee and Keith<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Larman can tell you, there are other approaches you<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; can take (and they really speak for what I would<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; characterize as &quot;schools of thought&quot; beyond their own<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; swordmaking endeavors).  I happen to like old blades,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; so having a tired old 14th century blade brought back<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to life in stunning period koshirae does it for me.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; But I&#39;ve seen what top notch shinsakuto look like and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; if you&#39;re not hung up on the historical dimension as I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; am, then those blades should knock your socks off (not<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to mention Chris&#39; point that you do then have the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; advantage of knowing exactly who made your blade, and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; when and where they made it, quite possibly even that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; they made it specifically for you).<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;    My thought here, and my reason for posting,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; particularly for posting at length, when I normally<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; confine myself to lurking punctuated by intermittent<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; lapses of sarcasm is that I thought it worth sharing<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; my sentiment that a proper blade (and in the interests<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of the art, I&#39;m not going to be exclusionary and try<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and tell you specifically what that is, because it<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; does have an element which is different from person to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; person)is worth the expense it takes to have one<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; properly mounted, whether you can afford it or not<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (and as a professor, I&#39;m quite sure I fall into that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; latter category).<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;    Nothing wrong with gunto (I used to collect them<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; myself) or Tozando Iaito.  But don&#39;t confuse them with<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the profoundly different experience of owning a true<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Nihonto with truly matched koshirae.  I think I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; probably paid about twice as much for the restoration<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and mounting of my Naminohira katana as I did for the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; bare blade.  I think the combined package yields me<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; far more satisfaction than the combined price, and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that satisfaction is one which can&#39;t be duplicated by<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; a pick and choose, catch as catch can approach.  If<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; you assemble your own hybrid then nobody, probably not<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; even you can really make sense of what it is you have<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; at the end of the day (and it may not be something<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; from which sense can later be made, even by you, as I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; have learned to my discomfort on more than one<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; occasion).  If you&#39;re willing to make the stretch to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Japanese quality standards, then there&#39;s an intrinsic<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; artistic reward which is not otherwise replicable.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;    That&#39;s the gist of my $0.015 on restoration.  When<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; you don&#39;t have expert knowledge of what you&#39;re doing,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; your best bet is to go to someone who does rather than<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to try and do it yourself, pick and choose. Having<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; said that, I&#39;m now going back to lurk mode and working<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; on my &quot;white lung disease&quot; between bouts of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; statistical and quantum mechanics.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Cheers,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Shirogitsune<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; __________________________________<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Do you Yahoo!?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; SBC Yahoo!

In his eyes, the false<br/>\nold signature had been part of the piece long enough to become part of its<br/>\nhistory, not perhaps the best part, but a part of some interest providing a<br/>\npiece of historical information which one would not simply discard or<br/>\ndestroy.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn Nihonto, we even have the case of gimei Muramasa blades, where signatures<br/>\nwere altered or changed when the legend of blades by that maker and his<br/>\nschool and their ill-luck for members of the Tokugawa family caused<br/>\npossession of Muramasa swords to be banned.  It seems a real crime against<br/>\nhistory simply to eradicate a feature so historically evocative as this<br/>\nparticular sort of gimei, and I would dispense with papers myself rather<br/>\nthan remove such a false signature.<br/>\n<br/>\nDavid<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\nFrom: &quot;Dr. Philip Vos Fellman&quot; &lt;shirogitsune99@...&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;token_kenkyu_kai@...&gt;<br/>\nCc: &lt;nihonto@yahoogroups.com&gt;<br/>\nSent: Saturday, July 19, 2003 3:25 PM<br/>\nSubject: RE: Gimei removal and Nakago Repatination<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Hi All:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   Earlier in the week we were discussing the removal<br/>\n&gt; of gimei and more generally nakago repatination.  I<br/>\n&gt; think something to keep in mind here is &quot;where are you<br/>\n&gt; going with your restoration project?&quot;  I have learned<br/>\n&gt; that hard way that Japanese-like is really not the<br/>\n&gt; same as Japanese, and, of course, the worst place to<br/>\n&gt; learn this kind of lesson is at shinsa.  Because<br/>\n&gt; everybody tends to want to dump pieces (as much or<br/>\n&gt; more koshirae as swords) which don&#39;t paper, I find<br/>\n&gt; there is a general reluctance to talk about the whole<br/>\n&gt; restoration process in the context of what I might<br/>\n&gt; label as &quot;external&quot; or &quot;Japanese market&quot; valuations of<br/>\n&gt; &quot;sword stuff&quot; (so we can encompass just blades, just<br/>\n&gt; fittings, fitting sets, and fully mounted blades).<br/>\n&gt;   If all you want to do is have a katana-like thing<br/>\n&gt; with which to practice iaido, then you might be better<br/>\n&gt; off with an iaito from Tozando.  Where things start to<br/>\n&gt; get blurry is when you have to use a &quot;real&quot; shinken.<br/>\n&gt; Many of who didn&#39;t get into the sword market early or<br/>\n&gt; wisely enough to buy good Nihonto when they were more<br/>\n&gt; plentiful and less expensive will migrate from replica<br/>\n&gt; type things which are not Japanese swords at all to<br/>\n&gt; gunto re-mounted buke-zukuri style.<br/>\n&gt;    Nothing wrong with that.  In fact for a tamesh-giri<br/>\n&gt; blade I would argue that is a good thing, because it<br/>\n&gt; avoids the possibility of damaging a blade with<br/>\n&gt; artistic and historical value.  However, as Chris can<br/>\n&gt; easily explain to you, &quot;gunto&quot; actually pertains to<br/>\n&gt; the mounts and there are swords from the Second World<br/>\n&gt; War which were made using traditional materials and<br/>\n&gt; methods and trashing one of these blades would be as<br/>\n&gt; unfortunate as wrecking an older blade.<br/>\n&gt;    The other thing is that if you are a martial<br/>\n&gt; artist, things can easily get a bit blurry over time.<br/>\n&gt; You can get conceptually sloppy, not be as serious<br/>\n&gt; about your collecting and restoration as you are about<br/>\n&gt; your practice.  The result is often a lot of small<br/>\n&gt; investments because you cannot afford the larger ones,<br/>\n&gt; only to look back a decade or so later and realize<br/>\n&gt; that all of those little purchases which generally<br/>\n&gt; amount to little or no cumulative value, were they<br/>\n&gt; simply done at one time, would have gotten you a fine<br/>\n&gt; sword in serviceable, collectable Edo period mounts.<br/>\n&gt;    Admittedly, not everything that is collectable is<br/>\n&gt; suitable for use - much of it should be relegated (or<br/>\n&gt; delegated) to pure connoisseurship, and if you have a<br/>\n&gt; blade which is a real &quot;work horse&quot;, you need several<br/>\n&gt; expert opinions if you want a blade which is (a)<br/>\n&gt; authentic (b) safe (c) not likely to be damaged by<br/>\n&gt; practice.  Having said all that, I had a very<br/>\n&gt; interesting experience recently which only reinforces<br/>\n&gt; my feeling that wherever it is even remotely feasible,<br/>\n&gt; you should at the very least aspire to having the real<br/>\n&gt; thing and not follow what has been aptly described to<br/>\n&gt; me as &quot;blind alleys&quot; of restoration.<br/>\n&gt;    I picked up a blade here in New Hampshire about 4<br/>\n&gt; years ago from a local dealer.  It was part of a trade<br/>\n&gt; I was working out with a guy who was going to do some<br/>\n&gt; paintings for me.  He wanted a koto blade in pretty<br/>\n&gt; good polish, so it took a while to find him something<br/>\n&gt; which would meet his criteria.  Eventually one of the<br/>\n&gt; guys here turned up an O-suriage ni-shaku blade with a<br/>\n&gt; very bad gimei of &quot;Nagamitsu&quot; but which while somewhat<br/>\n&gt; tired had a pleasantly bright habuchi, good hataraki<br/>\n&gt; and the &quot;blue&quot; of good Kyushu steel which comes not<br/>\n&gt; from Nugui but from some particular combination of<br/>\n&gt; alloys which Barry Hennick, Roger Robertshaw or Rich<br/>\n&gt; Stein could explain better than could I. In any case,<br/>\n&gt; I had figured it for maybe Higo Enju, seems that it is<br/>\n&gt; actually Yamato ko-Naminohira (Kyushu branch of Yamato<br/>\n&gt; den).<br/>\n&gt;    Anyway, the guy for whom I bought the blade didn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; care about the gimei, among other things because he<br/>\n&gt; can&#39;t read signatures and while he has a lot of swords<br/>\n&gt; (many times the number I have) he doesn&#39;t really care<br/>\n&gt; to know too much about them.  In the end our art deal<br/>\n&gt; didn&#39;t work out and the blade in shirasaya came back<br/>\n&gt; to me.<br/>\n&gt;    It&#39;s not of a size for me to be swinging around<br/>\n&gt; much (my Japanese students all want it, and they can&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; have it but that&#39;s a different story) but while it&#39;s a<br/>\n&gt; tired old warhorse, it does have about 600 years of<br/>\n&gt; age on it, and I felt some intrinsic resonance with<br/>\n&gt; the blade.  This is all personal, subjective stuff,<br/>\n&gt; but without that stuff, I fear few of us would<br/>\n&gt; collect.  Since I decided to keep the blade, I sent it<br/>\n&gt; to Cary to have the gimei removed.  Chris Bowen has<br/>\n&gt; guys in Japan who can do that for you as well.  The<br/>\n&gt; thing is that a professional mei removal is well worth<br/>\n&gt; the expense, because if done right, and if the nakago<br/>\n&gt; is properly repatinated/filed (the older the blade,<br/>\n&gt; the less filing that needs to be done, but the more<br/>\n&gt; complex and difficult the process of matching the<br/>\n&gt; existing texture is) then the blade is, in fact,<br/>\n&gt; RESTORED to what should have been its natural<br/>\n&gt; condition.<br/>\n&gt;    I would argue this goes for mounting blades as<br/>\n&gt; well.  If you are just looking for something to swing<br/>\n&gt; in class, then you might be concerned about safety or<br/>\n&gt; price first.  Do yourself a favor and don&#39;t confound<br/>\n&gt; this with authenticity.  There are a variety of views<br/>\n&gt; about why one would learn the Japanese sword arts and<br/>\n&gt; at one end of the spectrum you have the argument that<br/>\n&gt; if you are going to accurately preserve the art, then<br/>\n&gt; you should use the actual weapons in their actual<br/>\n&gt; amounts (I can see Clive Sinclair having a heart<br/>\n&gt; attack as he reads this, so let me qualify that by<br/>\n&gt; saying you should also have someone who knows better<br/>\n&gt; than you do advise you on what blades are suitable for<br/>\n&gt; various kinds of practice and which blades should not<br/>\n&gt; be handled in any way other than as rare<br/>\n&gt; collectables).<br/>\n&gt; At the other end, you have guys ordering perfectly<br/>\n&gt; serviceable blades from makers either here or in Japan<br/>\n&gt; who specialize in making weapons pretty much for every<br/>\n&gt; level and type of martial arts practice that you could<br/>\n&gt; envision.  If you&#39;re a martial artist, you eventually<br/>\n&gt; need to unbundle or &quot;unblur&quot; these distinctions and<br/>\n&gt; figure out what blade or blades you want or need, what<br/>\n&gt; they are and for what purpose are you collecting them.<br/>\n&gt; As a point of principle I would say that the<br/>\n&gt; non-martial artist needs to do this (hopefully sooner<br/>\n&gt; rather than later - which is where study comes in) as<br/>\n&gt; well.<br/>\n&gt;    A good experience for me has been the restoration<br/>\n&gt; on this Naminohira katana.  We really started from<br/>\n&gt; somewhere around &quot;less than zero&quot;.  An old blade in a<br/>\n&gt; fairly inexpensive shirasaya, gimei and no other<br/>\n&gt; fittings.  After Cary removed the bad mei and while we<br/>\n&gt; were waiting for the nakago repatination (it takes a<br/>\n&gt; few weeks) I sent him some tsuba for possible mounting<br/>\n&gt; pieces.  He picked out a Heianjo piece, not too far<br/>\n&gt; removed in time from when the blade was made and used<br/>\n&gt; that as the centerpiece from which to assemble and<br/>\n&gt; restore period koshirae.  Admittedly, I have a bit of<br/>\n&gt; an advantage here because knowing me, Cary could<br/>\n&gt; assemble mounts which in his words reflected both the<br/>\n&gt; spirit of the tsuba (as the centerpiece of the<br/>\n&gt; koshirae) and the personality of the owner.  That&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; just a bonus issue for me.  What is more important is<br/>\n&gt; that when I got the blade back, the whole package<br/>\n&gt; possessed the kind of harmony and authenticity you<br/>\n&gt; would immediately recognize as literally &quot;museum<br/>\n&gt; quality&quot;.  It&#39;s a nice (if rather tired) late 14th<br/>\n&gt; century blade in early-mid edo mounts &quot;en-suite&quot; fully<br/>\n&gt; restored, yet looking as if the whole package had been<br/>\n&gt; sitting in someone&#39;s home as a family treasure,<br/>\n&gt; mounted just as you see it, for the last three or four<br/>\n&gt; hundred years.<br/>\n&gt;    That&#39;s what I would call true &quot;restoration&quot;.  It&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; not just &quot;mounting up&quot; a blade (for practice or<br/>\n&gt; display) but is the process of creating an artistic<br/>\n&gt; whole which is demonstrably (the visual impact is<br/>\n&gt; basically &quot;wow&quot;, particularly if you know how this<br/>\n&gt; piece started out) more than the sum of its parts.<br/>\n&gt;    The last fifty years of sword collecting (if not<br/>\n&gt; much of the last five hundred years) seem to be<br/>\n&gt; characterized by a kind of dealers&#39; reverse mentality<br/>\n&gt; (I had a blade at one time which had been messed with<br/>\n&gt; during the Edo period to look like a Heian piece, so I<br/>\n&gt; know from experience that this kind of messing with<br/>\n&gt; blades has been going on for long and long) where the<br/>\n&gt; parts are worth more broken up than they are as an<br/>\n&gt; artistic whole.  While that might be economically true<br/>\n&gt; (and as often as not it&#39;s even a bad economic<br/>\n&gt; decision) it&#39;s an artistic travesty.  Another thing I<br/>\n&gt; did this month was manage to re-unite a Dai-Sho tsuba<br/>\n&gt; set which had been separated at least a hundred years<br/>\n&gt; ago.  One piece wound up in Canada and from there made<br/>\n&gt; its way to the U.S.  The other piece was in an<br/>\n&gt; European collection.  Neither owner even knew that<br/>\n&gt; their tsuba was part of a matched pair.  I can only<br/>\n&gt; speculate about what the swords and the other fittings<br/>\n&gt; might have been like (pretty good, I imagine if they<br/>\n&gt; still exist).<br/>\n&gt;    It is so easy in collecting to unknowingly and<br/>\n&gt; unintentionally destroy, it is rare and difficult to<br/>\n&gt; rejuvenate, recover and restore.  And as Chris has<br/>\n&gt; been telling us for years, restoration means a whole<br/>\n&gt; lot more than sending that rusty &quot;junker&quot; to an<br/>\n&gt; amateur polisher and then cobbling together enough<br/>\n&gt; bits and pieces of tosogu to create a mounted piece.<br/>\n&gt;   Admittedly, it might not matter to some people<br/>\n&gt; wether they are creating or destroying and they are<br/>\n&gt; more concerned about what they have (and how cheaply<br/>\n&gt; they got it) than they are about their piece having<br/>\n&gt; any kind of artistic integrity.  I had a very<br/>\n&gt; frustrating experience of this sort a few years ago.<br/>\n&gt; I had acquired (and still have) a very good Mito<br/>\n&gt; school sentoku tsuba (at least Ogawa Morihiro sensei<br/>\n&gt; said it was a very good Mito piece) and while I was<br/>\n&gt; visiting David Hamilton in New Mexico, he was wrapping<br/>\n&gt; a tsuka for a local gun dealer, which happened to have<br/>\n&gt; the identical (we can talk microscopic level here<br/>\n&gt; folks, I mean identity as in exact congruence not<br/>\n&gt; relative similarity) fuchi kashira (pretty obviously<br/>\n&gt; all disassembled from the same sword).  We tried<br/>\n&gt; everything we could think of to get those pieces back<br/>\n&gt; together - offered him the tsuba way below market -<br/>\n&gt; offered to by the fuchi-kashira way above market and<br/>\n&gt; pay for a new handle for him - all in vain.  He just<br/>\n&gt; wanted his piece and that was it.  Where it came from<br/>\n&gt; or where it was going was none of our business. Once<br/>\n&gt; humpty dumpty falls apart, reassembly is often<br/>\n&gt; difficult if not impossible.  As Stephen King says,<br/>\n&gt; &quot;you can&#39;t unring the bell&quot;.<br/>\n&gt;   So if you have a blade you are thinking about<br/>\n&gt; mounting or re-mounting, I would urge you to do it<br/>\n&gt; right the first time.  You have two guys easily to<br/>\n&gt; hand - Cary in San Francisco and Chris in Japan, both<br/>\n&gt; web accessible (http://www.ikkyudo.com and<br/>\n&gt; http://www.ejapaneseswords.com) who specialize in<br/>\n&gt; precisely what I&#39;ve been describing - restoration<br/>\n&gt; which is an act of art and an act of creation.<br/>\n&gt; Between the two of them their specializations are<br/>\n&gt; different enough that I regard them as complementary<br/>\n&gt; rather than competitive.  Of course, the older guys on<br/>\n&gt; the list know this already.  If you know Brian<br/>\n&gt; Tsernaga (sp?) or John Tirado and can get into their<br/>\n&gt; schedule, they are active participants in the<br/>\n&gt; authentic restoration process. But for the rest of us,<br/>\n&gt; it&#39;s a lot easier to go to one guy who has built a<br/>\n&gt; career specializing in authentic blades and<br/>\n&gt; restoration than to chase down all the individual<br/>\n&gt; pieces.  Different strokes.  When I was collecting<br/>\n&gt; gunto, Fred Lohman&#39;s service was perfect for me, and<br/>\n&gt; if you&#39;re mounting an oil-tempered gunto he&#39;s still<br/>\n&gt; the guy to go to.  If you want a traditional blade<br/>\n&gt; made with traditional materials and methods then go to<br/>\n&gt; Chris, who has modern blades covered, beginning with<br/>\n&gt; the opening of the Tatara in 1933 right through the<br/>\n&gt; current works of the Gassan school, or to Cary who<br/>\n&gt; specializes in older blades, Juyo Token and blades of<br/>\n&gt; Juyo quality which for relatively small reasons<br/>\n&gt; (sometimes nonsensically small from my point of view)<br/>\n&gt; didn&#39;t get a Juyo paper and so trade in the market at<br/>\n&gt; a quarter of the price of their indistinguishable<br/>\n&gt; counterparts.<br/>\n&gt;     As Mike Blue, Bill Latham, Mutsyhr Yee and Keith<br/>\n&gt; Larman can tell you, there are other approaches you<br/>\n&gt; can take (and they really speak for what I would<br/>\n&gt; characterize as &quot;schools of thought&quot; beyond their own<br/>\n&gt; swordmaking endeavors).  I happen to like old blades,<br/>\n&gt; so having a tired old 14th century blade brought back<br/>\n&gt; to life in stunning period koshirae does it for me.<br/>\n&gt; But I&#39;ve seen what top notch shinsakuto look like and<br/>\n&gt; if you&#39;re not hung up on the historical dimension as I<br/>\n&gt; am, then those blades should knock your socks off (not<br/>\n&gt; to mention Chris&#39; point that you do then have the<br/>\n&gt; advantage of knowing exactly who made your blade, and<br/>\n&gt; when and where they made it, quite possibly even that<br/>\n&gt; they made it specifically for you).<br/>\n&gt;    My thought here, and my reason for posting,<br/>\n&gt; particularly for posting at length, when I normally<br/>\n&gt; confine myself to lurking punctuated by intermittent<br/>\n&gt; lapses of sarcasm is that I thought it worth sharing<br/>\n&gt; my sentiment that a proper blade (and in the interests<br/>\n&gt; of the art, I&#39;m not going to be exclusionary and try<br/>\n&gt; and tell you specifically what that is, because it<br/>\n&gt; does have an element which is different from person to<br/>\n&gt; person)is worth the expense it takes to have one<br/>\n&gt; properly mounted, whether you can afford it or not<br/>\n&gt; (and as a professor, I&#39;m quite sure I fall into that<br/>\n&gt; latter category).<br/>\n&gt;    Nothing wrong with gunto (I used to collect them<br/>\n&gt; myself) or Tozando Iaito.  But don&#39;t confuse them with<br/>\n&gt; the profoundly different experience of owning a true<br/>\n&gt; Nihonto with truly matched koshirae.  I think I<br/>\n&gt; probably paid about twice as much for the restoration<br/>\n&gt; and mounting of my Naminohira katana as I did for the<br/>\n&gt; bare blade.  I think the combined package yields me<br/>\n&gt; far more satisfaction than the combined price, and<br/>\n&gt; that satisfaction is one which can&#39;t be duplicated by<br/>\n&gt; a pick and choose, catch as catch can approach.  If<br/>\n&gt; you assemble your own hybrid then nobody, probably not<br/>\n&gt; even you can really make sense of what it is you have<br/>\n&gt; at the end of the day (and it may not be something<br/>\n&gt; from which sense can later be made, even by you, as I<br/>\n&gt; have learned to my discomfort on more than one<br/>\n&gt; occasion).  If you&#39;re willing to make the stretch to<br/>\n&gt; Japanese quality standards, then there&#39;s an intrinsic<br/>\n&gt; artistic reward which is not otherwise replicable.<br/>\n&gt;    That&#39;s the gist of my $0.015 on restoration.  When<br/>\n&gt; you don&#39;t have expert knowledge of what you&#39;re doing,<br/>\n&gt; your best bet is to go to someone who does rather than<br/>\n&gt; to try and do it yourself, pick and choose. Having<br/>\n&gt; said that, I&#39;m now going back to lurk mode and working<br/>\n&gt; on my &quot;white lung disease&quot; between bouts of<br/>\n&gt; statistical and quantum mechanics.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Cheers,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Shirogitsune<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; __________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Do you Yahoo!?<br/>\n&gt; SBC Yahoo!
