Nobuhide is a student of Kiyomaro who some thing is the best in<br/>\nthe Shinshinto period. So when he gets a Jo-jo it is in comparison to<br/>\nKiyomaro... so kind of by definition he can&#39;t get Sai-jo if he&#39;s not as<br/>\ngood as his teacher, but his Jo-jo is going to be more important than<br/>\nsomeone else&#39;s Sai-jo. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think between the three it covers the answer.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Mei was niji mei which bothered me (missing &quot;Taira&quot; in it) but I found<br/>\n&gt; out today that Nobuhide did apparently sign niji mei.

            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-532266059\">Hi all - <br/>\n<br/>\nA nicely mounted and long shinshinto Nobuhide sold today at a local auction to a phone bidder. This was the sword I had mentioned several weeks ago regarding the mei being &quot;gold filled&quot; which seemed odd for a shinshinto sword. Yesterday, I finally saw some good photos of the blade and must admit that the mei looked darn good. I was not bidding, but a local friend did stick with it up to around $6,500 thereabout. (Darn auction house fee and state taxes really add up!) Curious if anyone knows who might had won the sword? <br/>\n<br/>\nInteresting. Looking in Toko Taikan I see that Nobuhide is &quot;valued&quot; over 11% higher than Naotane (and Tsuda Sukenao, another example checked). This surprised me that he (jojo saku) would be valued higher than Naotane (saijo saku) or Sukenao (jojo saku). Thoughts on this, anyone?<br/>\n<br/>\nMei was niji mei which bothered me (missing &quot;Taira&quot; in it) but I found out today that Nobuhide did apparently sign niji mei.
