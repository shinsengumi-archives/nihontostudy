The<br/>\n  protectors are beaten, patinated, lacquered and adorned with golden<br/>\n  figures from famous Japanese war stories. The workmanship makes<br/>\n  Fabergé look almost amateur.<br/>\n<br/>\n  The sword fittings are from the collection of Alexander G. Moslé, a<br/>\n  German businessman who worked in Japan from 1884 to 1907. As the<br/>\n  representative of the Gruson Company, a subsidiary of Krupp Steel,<br/>\n  Moslé was able to persuade the Japanese government to switch from<br/>\n  French to German arms just as Japan was asserting itself as a<br/>\n  military power. (The first Sino-Japanese War was in 1894-95 and the<br/>\n  Russo-Japanese War in 1904-05.)<br/>\n<br/>\n  The arms trade made Moslé wealthy; at one point he had 2,249<br/>\n  Japanese swords, armor, more than 1,600 sword fittings, Japanese<br/>\n  paintings, prints, sculptures, ceramics, lacquer and textiles. Moslé<br/>\n  retired in 1907 and returned to Germany, working with scholars and<br/>\n  dealers to learn more about his collection. In 1909 he exhibited it<br/>\n  at the Königliches Kunstgewerbe Museum in Berlin. It was published<br/>\n  in two catalogs in 1914, which are still considered important<br/>\n  reference works.<br/>\n<br/>\n  In the late 1920&#39;s, Moslé traveled to the United States to try to<br/>\n  sell his collection to public institutions. He did sell some prints<br/>\n  to the Art Institute of Chicago and some lacquers to the Freer<br/>\n  Gallery of Art in Washington, but, apparently, little more. He was<br/>\n  in the United States in 1941, when America went to war, and was<br/>\n  stranded here. Sometime before his death in 1949, he entered a<br/>\n  mental institution.<br/>\n<br/>\n  His bank organized a sale of his Japanese works at Parke-Bernet in<br/>\n  New York in 1948, including the fittings in this sale. These 170<br/>\n  works have been in private hands since that earlier sale. They<br/>\n  include simple designs made of iron and ceremonial sets embellished<br/>\n  with gold, silver and copper.

One is a pair of 17th-century<br/>\nJapanese six-panel screens that depict the Portuguese on their ships<br/>\nas they are approaching Japan. The Japanese found the foreigners<br/>\nstrange; they are depicted with red hair, bulging eyes and huge<br/>\nnoses. This cross-cultural art, known as Namban in Japan, is always<br/>\nworth a look, if only to see how Westerners were viewed when first<br/>\nencountered.<br/>\n<br/>\nChristie&#39;s is also selling an entire set of Noh theater masks and<br/>\nrobes from an Edo-period (1615-1868) collection.

They range in price from a few<br/>\nthousand to a few hundred thousand dollars apiece.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is not easy for Americans to appreciate the importance of swords<br/>\nin pre-20th-century Japan. Beginning in feudal times, Japanese<br/>\nwarlords equipped their armies with razor-sharp swords and fancy<br/>\nsword fittings.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;During the Edo period, a time of peace, swords were worn as status<br/>\nsymbols,&quot; said Mr. Izzard, who was the head of the Japanese and<br/>\nKorean art department at Christie&#39;s from 1980 to 1997. &quot;Craft<br/>\nschools specializing in sword fittings emerged, each with its own<br/>\ntraditions and styles.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSamurai wore their swords in public, a symbol of class and honor. A<br/>\nsamurai might choose quiet, subdued fittings to wear at a high<br/>\ngovernmental occasion or something more flamboyant for a more casual<br/>\nevent, much as women wear their jewels today. In 1876 the emperor<br/>\nMeiji banned the wearing of swords in public as part of his<br/>\nmodernization campaign.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;What were once wearable symbols of wealth, prestige or entitlement<br/>\nbecame relics that illustrated 600 years of designs by some of the<br/>\nworld&#39;s finest metalworkers,&quot; Mr. Izzard said. &quot;Collecting swords<br/>\nand their fittings quickly became popular in Japan and the West. Mosl<br/>\né&#39;s tenure in Japan coincided with the wave of interest in Japanese<br/>\nart among Westerners, who were intrigued by the recently opened<br/>\ncountry and its culture.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nJaponisme swept over Europe and America, influencing artists,<br/>\nfurniture and textile designers and metalworkers. Mr. Moslé was in<br/>\nthe right place at the right time. The Metropolitan Museum of Art,<br/>\nthe Brooklyn Museum and the Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum all<br/>\nhave Japanese metalwork in their collections, some from the same<br/>\nperiod.<br/>\n<br/>\nMany of Mr. Izzard&#39;s sword fittings come in beautifully lacquered<br/>\nboxes that may have been commissioned by Mr. Moslé; they are works<br/>\nof art in themselves. Sword fittings are ardently collected by<br/>\nconnoisseurs of Japanese art, so it is worth seeing Mr. Moslé&#39;s<br/>\ncollection before it is dispersed.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoyle New York will not have its Chinese porcelain auction until<br/>\nOct. 27, but from Monday through next Friday the auction house is<br/>\nscheduling previews by appointment for 60 lots of Chinese blue and<br/>\nwhite porcelain from the Kangxi period (1662-1722) from the Ralph<br/>\nSpencer Collection. (Information: Andrea Blunck Frost, Doyle&#39;s Asian<br/>\nart expert, 212-427-4141.)<br/>\n<br/>\nMr. Spencer assembled his collection in the 1960&#39;s and 70&#39;s on trips<br/>\nto London and at prominent Manhattan galleries like Chait. He was a<br/>\ncontemporary, and collecting rival, of<br/>\n<br/>\nF. Gordon Morrill, whose Chinese porcelain collection Doyle sold<br/>\nlast September for $12 million. (Morrill&#39;s rare Yuan dynasty pilgrim<br/>\nflask, circa 1345, sold for $5.8 million, a world auction record for<br/>\na piece of Chinese porcelain.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Spencer Collection, which is later in date, is expected to earn<br/>\nabout $300,000.<br/>\n<br/>\nPhiladelphia Curator<br/>\n<br/>\nAnne d&#39;Harnoncourt, the director of the Philadelphia Museum of Art,<br/>\nhas announced the appointment of David L. Barquist as curator of<br/>\nAmerican decorative arts, beginning in January. Mr. Barquist has<br/>\nbeen acting curator of American decorative arts at the Yale<br/>\nUniversity Art Gallery, where he began his career as an intern in<br/>\n1981.<br/>\n<br/>\nAn authority on American silver, Mr. Barquist is the author of &quot;Myer<br/>\nMyers: Jewish Silversmith in Colonial New York&quot; and &quot;American and<br/>\nEnglish Pewter at the Yale University Art Gallery.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;The Philadelphia collections are extraordinary, but the museum is<br/>\nregionally focused,&quot; Mr. Barquist said in an interview. &quot;In trying<br/>\nto present the story of American decorative arts, there are a few<br/>\nholes one would try to fill judiciously. We need a few carefully<br/>\nchosen examples of works from places like Boston to play off of the<br/>\nmuseum&#39;s collections.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2004/09/17/arts/design/17ANTI.html\">http://www.nytimes.com/2004/09/17/arts/design/17ANTI.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---<br/>\nSamurai Archives: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.samurai-archives.com\">http://www.samurai-archives.com</a><br/>\nSamurai Archives store: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\">http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives</a><br/>\n---<br/>\nYahoo!
