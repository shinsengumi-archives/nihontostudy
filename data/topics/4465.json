            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-910857054\">The information below was found by a friend of mine.<br/>\n<br/>\nThree directors, including the Chairman, who were due to retire soon, have been resigned by the NBTHK on full pay until their retirement date. Two of these were retired policemen.<br/>\nThe Chairman has been replaced by Mr Sasa.<br/>\nThe problem was that the Bunka-Cho had given a directive that the NBTHK panel should not put their own swords, nor those owned by their relatives, up for examination. The NBTHK rebelled against this, but Mr Goto, the two policemen and two others  - that is five out of fourteen directors - agreed with the Bunka-Cho code. <br/>\nThe dismissed three are appealing that their contract should not be ended since it was somehow arranged between the Police Department and the NBTHK. There are legal mutterings. <br/>\nIt was shown by the previous Chairman Goto, that between 2001 when the Bunka-Cho directive was announced , and today, there have been 515 instances of that directive having been contravened.<br/>\nTokyo Shimbun.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe above was published on the Chunichi WEB Press in Japanese on 11 September, and taken from the Tokyo Shimbun report of 3 September.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlan<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
