It&#39;s hard to see much of the character of the plate itself.  Silver fukurin aren&#39;t common on older pieces, but this one doesn&#39;t look so new.  There are some early tachi koshirae with silver fittings.  The size and shape seem OK for mounting on a nagamaki, but I haven&#39;t seen many old nagamaki koshirae for comparison.  The namako sukashi (now filled) make me wonder if it was previously mounted on a sword, and if so that would further confuse the time period.  On the other hand I wonder if the sukashi was made with the intention of adding lead fillings to increase the mass of the guard (lead is about 1.46x as dense as iron).<br/>\n<br/>\nSeeing it in person would help.  Might still be a puzzler.<br/>\n<br/>\nJim<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Yeah, the yamagane tsuba is massive. I will have to measure it when I get a<br/>\n  chance. Your tsuba does look early to me.
