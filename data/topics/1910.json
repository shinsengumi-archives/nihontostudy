            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1211294304\">Hi,<br/>\nI&#39;m new to this group and I have a question regarding a recently <br/>\npurchased Katana. I purchased the sword from a WW2 veteran who was <br/>\nstationed in Japan during and post surrender. My question is that I <br/>\ndon&#39;t know how old the sword is, even though I can see that it&#39;s <br/>\nextremely old but I can&#39;t put an exact date on the sword. If anyone <br/>\ncan help me with this matter I would be deeply grateful. I uploaded <br/>\nclose up pictures of the sword into the folder &quot;Bladeben Katana&quot; in <br/>\nthe photo section. The sword is 25.5 inches in total length and the <br/>\nblade is 20.5 inches long. Also, if anyone can tell me from the <br/>\nshape, hamon pattern etc. who might have made the sword? I ask this <br/>\nas the tang is not signed or might have been but lost over time. I <br/>\neagerly await any responses.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks<br/>\nBen (bladeben)</div>",
