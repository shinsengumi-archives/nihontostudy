This is from an article by Kashima Susumu:<br/>\n<br/>\n  &quot;This group of artisans is believed to have accepted the invitation from the Ouchi family ruling over Hagi in Choshu and moved to live there from Kyoto.  No further details however have been brought to light as yet.<br/>\n<br/>\n  &quot;Study of extant examples attributed to the Ko-Hagi school leads us to the finding of an only very limited amount of characteristics common to Kyo-sukashi:  it is not significant enough to decisively conclude the existence of direct relationship between the two sukashi schools.<br/>\n<br/>\n  &quot;As far as the extant examples are concerned, a majority of the motifs found on Ko-Hagi tsuba in common deals with chrysanthemum sprays, which are characteristically executed by means of the openwork technique creating positive and negative silhouettes.<br/>\n<br/>\n  &quot;It should be noted that this school has no relationship with the so-called Choshu tsuba artisans, who flourished most from the middle through the end of the Edo period in the area centered around Hagi, and whose style and technique have little in common with Ko-Hagi&#39;s.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nJim<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
