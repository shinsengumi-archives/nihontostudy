I have seen wire work like that on Kyo Shoami a few times as well, but the carving and inlay style does not look like their work.  Unsigned Bizen Shoami can be tough to tell from Kyo Shoami, so it&#39;s possible, but it looks more Bushu/Choshu to me.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSome of the original Choshu designs can be bold and the early workmanship is good.  All of the rote repetition in the later work dilutes the image of the group.  I think that one of Nakai Zensuke Tomotsune&#39;s famous guards was in a grape vine motif.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor what it&#39;s worth, I just flipped through Tsuba-Ko Bushu Ito Ha and found one example in shakudo with that sort of wire tendril work.  <br/>\n<br/>\nJim<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Hi Jim, all - <br/>\n<br/>\n  I&#39;m curious about this iron tsuba which I&#39;ve placed in the photo album (Ron STL) named &quot;sworddad.&quot; Iron sukashi measuring 79.3 mm, squared edge, motif of grape leaves/grapes with vines, backside shows back of blossoms, etc. Heavy gold applied to flowers.
