            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1695677546\">Hi:<br/>\n I should know a little about Fred&#39;s book as I wrote a brief foreword<br/>\nfor it. I contains some useful information derived from various sources,<br/>\nhowever the whole area of books on gendai is rapidly changing and there<br/>\nis no definitive book out there to the best of my knowledge. Fred&#39;s book<br/>\nis a contribution to the literature and there are a number of similar<br/>\nbooks in the same space. <br/>\n The problem is that the very term &quot;gendai&quot;, meaning current era, has<br/>\nnever been well defined in year brackets and it is slipping into disuse.<br/>\nFor some it is for <br/>\nall blades made after the Haitorei regulations which culminated in the<br/>\nbanning of civilian wearing of swords in public in 1876, for others the<br/>\nterm starts with the blades of the Showa era, that being 1926-1989, and<br/>\neven after, and for others it ends in 1945 or shortly after, say with<br/>\nthe end of the Occupation in 1953. The term used now for blades made<br/>\ncontemporarily is &quot;shinsakuto&quot; or &quot;new made swords&quot; and that gets pushed<br/>\nback to the end of gendaito, whenever that might be, so take your pick.<br/>\nMuch of what is out there now represents culled work from other sources<br/>\nand there is little original research. Mr. Chris Bowen, who was resident<br/>\nin Japan for some years, since having returned to the USA, has gathered<br/>\na lot of information on gendai smiths of the Tokyo area and has stated<br/>\nthat a book will eventually be produced. That is something I am eagerly<br/>\nlooking forward to as it will contain original information in English on<br/>\na number of smiths, particularly those working during the last war,<br/>\nabout whom little is known outside or inside Japan. I have no idea when<br/>\nit will see the light of day.<br/>\n One recent book that you should get is Yasukuni To by Tom Kishida and<br/>\npublished this year by Kodansha. It is focused primarily on the blades<br/>\nmade at the Yasukuni Jinja in Tokyo, but in putting them in context it<br/>\nsays a fair amount about the low state of blade making prior to 1933,<br/>\ntells us something about the destruction of the basis for the craft<br/>\nright after 1876 and also discusses the traditions from which the<br/>\nYasukuni smiths came from and something of their work after the war. It<br/>\nis a must have book!<br/>\n I hope this helps.<br/>\n Regards, <br/>\n Arnold Frenzel<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mjaillet@...\">mjaillet@...</a> 07/15/05 9:46 AM &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Hi Everyone,<br/>\n             Quick question about a book.
