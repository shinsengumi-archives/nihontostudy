            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-300054844\">Franco,<br/>\n<br/>\nJust an update as you were kind enough to offer advice and  an opinion. <br/>\nI reread a JSSUS article by T.C. Ford regarding fire damaged blades and<br/>\nretempering.  After reading this article and others, I can say with a<br/>\nreasonable amount of confidence , Hamon loss due to fire and retempering<br/>\nis not the case with this blade.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe blade is obviously not in top condition and I also adjusted the<br/>\nphoto scene balance in order to hopefully enhance the grain pattern. <br/>\nThe pictures do look as though the sword at some time had been recovered<br/>\nfrom a fire. Particularly the Hada 2 and 3, but the sword really doesn&#39;t<br/>\nappear that brown or scaly.<br/>\n<br/>\nDue to the rough condition of the sword the  Hamon is there, but not<br/>\nthat visible.  I really feel as though the sword has not had polish<br/>\nsince the original. ( There doesn&#39;t seem to be any reduction from Nakago<br/>\nto blade).  I can also say the sword would look absolutely stunning with<br/>\na fresh polish.   Future decision....<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\n<br/>\nDave<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com\">nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;dwmac2000&quot; &lt;dwmac2000@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hello Franco,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thank you, Fire damage is something I had not considered.
