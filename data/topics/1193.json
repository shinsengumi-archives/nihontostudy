Before responding<br/>\nto a part of the specific question you have put before the list, let me<br/>\nmake two general points.<br/>\nFirst, I really like the idea of cross-cultural trends in martial arts - by<br/>\nwhich I assume you mean the embellishment of weapons and associated<br/>\nmaterial objects as opposed to the behaviors of fighting.  This strikes me<br/>\nas terribly interesting. I have always wondered about the distribution of<br/>\nwritten messages on blades, for example. The worldwide occurrence of swords<br/>\nwith side blades, is another thing that somebody really ought to describe.<br/>\nYou are operating in a very interesting - and even significant - area.<br/>\nSecond, I think you will find that the wonder of Japanese swords is in the<br/>\ndetails.

            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-274142049\">Hello all.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been following the emails of this group for a while, and I must say<br/>\nthat I&#39;ve truly enjoyed reading many of the messages that go out.  The<br/>\ncollective knowledge in this group is amazing.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis leads me to my question.  Well, first a little background.  I&#39;m<br/>\ncurrently working on my MA in Art History at LSU.  My thesis work is on<br/>\ncross-cultural currents of martial arts in the global community.  As a bit<br/>\nof side research, I&#39;ve been studying sword mounts, especially those of<br/>\nJapanese origin.  I&#39;m aware that the steel sword is introduced to Japan<br/>\nfrom China sometime pre-Nara.  I&#39;m also fairly up to speed on the<br/>\ntransformation of the sword from the Chinese design to one that is purely<br/>\nJapanese.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, what I&#39;m trying to determine is if there is any evidence of the<br/>\nJapanese style mounts ever being made in China (or SE Asia, Phillipines,<br/>\netc) prior to the modern age.  If any of you could point me in the right<br/>\ndirection, I&#39;d be most grateful.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\n<br/>\nBuddy Ethridge<br/>\nExhibitions Coordinator<br/>\nLSU Libraries</div>",
