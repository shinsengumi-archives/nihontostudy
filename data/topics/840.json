Looking at the set again yesterday, I have gained a new appreciation of it and can see why it was purchased several years ago. It certainly looks Momoyama era work and fits the bill for early f/k style as described by Gordon during his exhibit talks. If that early I would think the mei would be kind of unique to find.  <br/>\n<br/>\nRon<br/>\nSTL<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: alchemyst <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com\">nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Wednesday, October 01, 2003 9:10 AM<br/>\n  Subject: [nihontostudy] Re: fuchi/kashira set mei<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Ron -<br/>\n<br/>\n  Nicely carved mei, but nothing in the Kinko Meikan<br/>\n  close to it.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Rich S<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!

Then I realized that it was signed which made me wonder (and my question to you all) if you find Momoyama era fittings very often signed? Well, I guess you do but if so, I have seen very few that were signed. This led me to wonder if this set was really that early or what. Looking in Haynes&#39; books I do not see a Muneyoshi (kao) referenced--without kao, yes, but none with kao. Could read Soyoshi, sokichi...maybe something totally different?  Hopefully the links will work (in Yahoo pictures) and if so, I would appreciate any comments that you may have as to when these were made and what era. (apologies for the poor photo...mei is fine, though.)<br/>\n<br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://tinyurl.com/p40k\">http://tinyurl.com/p40k</a><br/>\n<br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://tinyurl.com/p40v\">http://tinyurl.com/p40v</a><br/>\n<br/>\n  Any help or impressions or comments...all appreciated.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Ron<br/>\n  STL<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
