            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-890983434\">I would think it more likely that the habaki is an expression of the owner/user&#39;s political allegiance, rather than indicating a &quot;solid&quot; Tokugawa connection.  Of course, by this time I imagine the aoi mon was being used as a &quot;decorator&quot; item by all and sundry with no fear of losing one&#39;s head!!  As Peter observed, if the habaki is a high quality item it points more to my first suggestion and if poorer quality then to the second.  Here in Australia there is a Koto wakizashi by (I think) IESUKE (nijimei) that has a solid gold niju habaki with a sukashi Oda mon.  The quality is just excellent, but is it a &quot;connection/allegiance&quot; piece or a &quot;decorator&quot;??  Without a large number of documented similar pieces we will never know.<br/>\n<br/>\nBarry Thomas<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Ron Hartmann <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:token_kenkyu_kai@...\">token_kenkyu_kai@...</a> ; nihontostudy ; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nihonto@yahoogroups.com\">nihonto@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Monday, April 02, 2007 6:41 AM<br/>\n  Subject: [nihonto] Yamon Naokatsu<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Hi all - <br/>\n<br/>\n  Does anyone know of any connection that Yamon Naokatsu (2nd generation) had with the Tokugawa? Reason I ask, I have a short katana by Shoji Yamon Naokatsu (dated Meiji 4 - 1871) which has a silver habaki with the Tokugawa aoi crest on it in sukashi (pierced). I believe this habaki was original to the sword (not a collector&#39;s replacement) but so far I&#39;ve yet to find some connection between the smith and the Tokugawa. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Thanks,<br/>\n<br/>\n  Ron<br/>\n  STL<br/>\n  .<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>",
