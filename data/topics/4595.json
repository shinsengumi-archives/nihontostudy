Unfortunately it is a part of the learning curve associated with this hobby.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as the dealers go, many of the people who have tables at shows are not dealers.  They are collectors who are upgrading their collections, just like you, in San Fran by selling pieces that have nothing left to teach them and buying new ones that they hope to learn from.  The majority of these people have the same limited knowledge selling their items as you did buying it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI doubt if they had any intent to mislead you, they just did not know any better.  Unfortunately this is true in most instances.  The seller has very little idea as to what he or she is selling.  This in my experience this applies equally to blades that are gime, and fittings that are less than what they may be demonstrated as.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe dealers who make their living buying and selling swords and fittings know exactly what they are selling, and if they should make a mistake, they will look after you.<br/>\n<br/>\nIts all part of the learning curve.<br/>\n<br/>\nJohn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Elliott <br/>\n  To: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com <br/>\n  Sent: Monday, November 06, 2006 8:44 AM<br/>\n  Subject: [nihontostudy] Re: my photo album, pictures 19 and 20<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Curran,<br/>\n<br/>\n  I apologize, I sometimes &#39;leap before looking&#39;!

I&#39;m<br/>\nin the process of papering them (slow process)and<br/>\ndeciding which to keep. I planned to let an auction<br/>\nhouse sell them, but learned the auction houses get<br/>\ntheir pound of flesh! Unless I give them over $100,000<br/>\nof items... they take a greater % than any dealer I<br/>\nknow.<br/>\n    As the tsuba come back from Japan, I&#39;ll just put<br/>\nthem out at Tampa sword show and possibly Chicago--<br/>\nbut ultimately a few of them will probably end up with<br/>\na dealer.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo go easy on the dealers.
