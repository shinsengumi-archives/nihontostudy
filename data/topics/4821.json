            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-989503082\">Some political turmoil was going on earlier this year at the NBTHK and my understand is that this caused people to spin their wheels, shall I say. Mr. Tanobe told us in October that all of this has been resolved and things are moving ahead once again. I&#39;ve no clue if this has delayed shinsa results although I suspect it has. Early in last year several swords sent over did take a longer than usual time to clear shinsa. At that time, according to what Tanobe san told me, they were simply hit with an unusually large number of shinsa submissions. I suspect it has been a combination of such things that my have slowed things down a bit. Hopefully 2007 will see things back into a more normal mode for them. <br/>\n<br/>\nRon<br/>\nSTL<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Richard Turner <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com\">nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Monday, January 15, 2007 3:37 PM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [nihontostudy] NBTHK October Shinsa<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  I just hear they had 1000 swords in backlog, I don&#39;t know if this is <br/>\n  right or not, just what I heard.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Rich<br/>\n<br/>\n  Curran Campbell wrote:<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt; List,<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt; I&#39;ve heard the NBTHK had a considerable number of<br/>\n  &gt; sword and fittings submittals, and was running behind<br/>\n  &gt; on the considerable workload.<br/>\n  &gt; I&#39;m sure the holidays didn&#39;t help either.<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt; Anyone able to confirm this?
