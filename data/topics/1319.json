In practice this<br/>\nis not always possible but I do try......  However I think you will find<br/>\nthat most of these prices are still lower than what is common on the<br/>\nnet. Try Satcho, Jinsoo or Mr. Weissberg for example. That being said<br/>\noffers are always considered, I am pretty difficult to insult as far as<br/>\nthat goes. <br/>\n <br/>\nI can let the book you want go for $85 including wordwide shipping. That<br/>\nworks out at the same as the ebay one if you add on the shipping to<br/>\nthat.

Take a<br/>\nmoment to look this post over, some of these items are pretty hard to come<br/>\nby these days. Free shipping to list members within Europe, 50% off shipping<br/>\nto all others. Extensive descriptions and pix available on request.<br/>\n <br/>\nFor Sale Books:<br/>\n <br/>\n1. Japanese Swords & Sword Furniture in the Museum of Fine Arts Boston by<br/>\nMorihiro Ogawa 1987. Hardback. This is a big heavy book that is quite rare<br/>\nnow. Over 400 items listed in 423 pages. Lots of juyo quality stuff, making<br/>\nthis a super reference book. Very good copy with very good dustjacket. Some<br/>\nslight fading to the spine (dj) and some very small bumps only, otherwise<br/>\nperfect. Comes with separate glossery in mint condition. Asking $450<br/>\n <br/>\n2. The Armour book in Honcho-Gunkiko by Arai Hakuseki 1964. Hardback. Rare<br/>\nreference book. Very good condition, with only one very small tear to the<br/>\nback of the dustjacket and priceclipped. Comes with protective brodart cover<br/>\nfor the dj. Asking $200<br/>\n <br/>\n3. The Hartman Collection of Japanese metalwork by Christie&#39;s, Mason and<br/>\nWoods Ltd 1976. Published as a hardback with no dustjacket this book is in<br/>\nvery good condition also. Only slight fading to the spine, otherwise<br/>\nperfect. Comes with original errata and list of estimates (loose).<br/>\nUnfortunately no list of prices realised. A definate must have for any<br/>\nserious tsuba or kodogu collector, the collection of tsuba within is simply<br/>\nstunning. Asking $150<br/>\n <br/>\n4. Masterpieces of the R. B. Caldwell collection of Japanese Sword Fittings<br/>\nby Patrick Syz 1994. Hardback. One very tiny crease to the top of the<br/>\ndustjacket (hardly noticeable), otherwise absolutely mint. Comes with<br/>\nprotective brodart cover for the dj. Asking $200<br/>\n <br/>\n5. The Arts of the Japanese Sword by B.W. Robinson. First edition, 1961.<br/>\nHardback. The book that every novice sword collector should have in his /<br/>\nher collection. Very good condition, but no dustjacket.

An absolute<br/>\nClassic, this was the first English reference book written by a noted<br/>\nJapanese expert. In super condition, this book is a treasure to behold. One<br/>\nsmall tear to the dustjacket next to the spine only. No fading, no creases,<br/>\nnothing. The book looks like it was published yesterday ! Interesting little<br/>\nvintage pamphlet from the Japan Sword Co selling kitchen knives inside.<br/>\nComes with protective brodart cover for the dj. Asking $250<br/>\n <br/>\n7. Early Japanese Sword Guards; Sukashi Tsuba, by Masayuki Sasano 1972.<br/>\nHardback. Classic reference book on sukashi tsuba this usually retails in<br/>\nthe $225 - 300 range depending on condition. Hoever this example is ex<br/>\nlibris and has the usual library stamps inside. When it was in the library<br/>\nthe dustjacket was stuck to the inside of the book(!). This has since been<br/>\nremedied and the dustjacket is now loose and comes in a protective brodart<br/>\ncover but you can still see where it used to be stuck on. Otherwise in good<br/>\n- very good condition. Asking $175 <br/>\n <br/>\n8. The Carlo Monzino Collection of Japanese Sword Fittings and Swords by<br/>\nSotheby&#39;s 1996. Wonderful hardback auction catalog in mint condition. 122<br/>\npages of outstanding pieces. Asking $60<br/>\n <br/>\n9.

Scarce<br/>\ncatalog full of tsuba and other sword fittings, very lavishly illustrated.<br/>\nIn extremely good condition and very hard to come by. This is recommended<br/>\nfor any kodogu lover. Comes with protective brodart cover for the dj. Asking<br/>\n$125<br/>\n <br/>\n11. Tsuba II: Returned Tsuba from Europe, by Inami Tomihiko. Hardback. This<br/>\nis the second of a set of two describing various tsuba that were returned<br/>\nfrom Germany and Europe to Japan. Both are very hard to find. An interesting<br/>\nbook with 200 tsuba illustrated in this volume, most in b/w but also quite a<br/>\nfew in color. Be warned this book is in Japanese though! Extremely good<br/>\ncondition all round. Comes with protective brodart cover for the dj. Asking<br/>\n$100<br/>\n <br/>\n12. Illustrated catalogues of Tokyo National Museum Sword guard(s) by Tokyo<br/>\nNational Museum, 1979. Hardback. Another scarce / rare book illustrating 542<br/>\ntsubas in the Tokyo National Museum.  Black and white pictures<br/>\nunfortunately, but still a must have reference for any serious tsuba<br/>\ncollector. I saw one copy in tatty condition sell on ebay last year for<br/>\nsomething like $300 (!). This copy is in very good to fine condition. Comes<br/>\nwith protective brodart cover for the dj. Asking $175<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\nRight and now on to the sword that I have for sale. This Nambokucho (14th<br/>\ncentury) sword was purchased last year from Aoi Arts in Japan. It comes with<br/>\nfairly recent NBTHK Tokubetsu Hozon papers, a professional oshigata done at<br/>\nAoi Arts and their own menu shaped certificate describing the sword and<br/>\nstating that it was then valued at 1,2 million yen. The sword is in a<br/>\nshirasaya, no koshirae and is in excellent polish. I was toying with the<br/>\nidea of submitting it to Juyo Shinsa, but have so far not got round to it. I<br/>\ndon&#39;t know if it would stand a chance of going Juyo, but I think that it<br/>\nshould be submitted if only just for the experience which would be very<br/>\neducational in my opinion. It is attributed to the Nakajima Rai school which<br/>\nseems to be pretty darn rare. At least this is the only one I have ever<br/>\nseen. Below is the info exactly as on the Aoi Arts certificate.<br/>\n <br/>\n&#39;We certify the following Katana is genuine. Detail, Katana: the NBTHK<br/>\nTokubetsu-hozon token. <br/>\nSignature: Unsigned, attributed to Nakajima-Rai. The blade is polished, in a<br/>\nshirasaya. Blade length: 62.7 cm or 24.69 inches.<br/>\nSori: 1.0 cm or 0.39 inch.<br/>\nWidth at the hamachi: 2.98cm or 1.17 inches.<br/>\nWidth at the yokote: 2.11 cm or 0.83 inch.<br/>\nThickness at the hamachi: 0.74 cm or 0.29 inch.<br/>\nEra: Nambokucho-period. 14th century. <br/>\n <br/>\nShape: A shinogi-zukuri katana. Broadish blade has plenty thickness and the<br/>\npoint is O-kissaki.<br/>\nJitetsu: Small mokume is combined with small itame-hada. Fine jitetsu bears<br/>\ndelicate jinie.<br/>\nHamon: Nie-deki. Naka-suguha hamon goes with ashi, yo, kinsuji and<br/>\nsunagashi.<br/>\nBoshi: Niju-ba turns back roundly on the front. <br/>\n <br/>\nA glance at this sword shows that clearly Rai School tradition. Acceptable<br/>\no-hada appears about six inches above the hamachi. Superb jitetsu and<br/>\nsensitive works on the ha are the point of appreciation. 1,200,000 Yen.&#39; <br/>\n <br/>\nI still have the original Aoi Arts pictures that can be sent on request.<br/>\nAsking $12,500. <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\nThanks for taking the time to read all this and let me know if I can be of<br/>\nany further help or if any of you want pix or more detailed descriptions.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:matthew@...\">matthew@...</a> <br/>\n <br/>\n- Matthew. <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    Z Recruiting Services<br/>\n    &quot;Zurich Toren&quot; Muzenstraat 89<br/>\n    2511 WB Den Haag<br/>\n    T: +31 70 4262273<br/>\n    F: +31 70 4262111<br/>\n    W: zrecruiting.com<br/>\n    E: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:info@...\">info@...</a><br/>\n    Kijk ook op monsterboard.nl, jobbingmall.nl en <br/>\n    nationalevacaturebank.nl voor actuele vacatures!<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nYahoo!
