The obverse reads, &#39;Surrendered by Shosa <br/>\n(Major) Nagamura Kiyotaka, Japanese VIII army, Emirau Island, 21st March <br/>\n1944&#39;.  The reverse reads, &#39;To A. B. Boyles, U.S.M.C.&#39;.  This is an <br/>\nexample of a spurious postwar engraving added to increase value:  <br/>\nresearch indicates that Emirau was evacuated by the Japanese two months <br/>\nbefore the invasion of the US 4th Marines on 20 March 1944.  The USMC <br/>\nhas no record of an A. B. Boyles. (R. Gregory collection.)<br/>\n<br/>\nMy point is, there are swords with Inscriptions on them.  You need to <br/>\nthoroughly check it out.

            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-250718202\">I didnt get the sword as pictured in the ebay auction, but what I <br/>\nactually got has now caused a bit of concern. I brought the sword <br/>\nover to a freind&#39;s party wearing it as a costume accessory, as I <br/>\nthought it was a fake with little value. At the party their was a <br/>\ngentleman that is a metallurgy expert, he told me he has spent years <br/>\nresearching the ancient technology of Japanese sword making and <br/>\npersonally had met with several professors in Japan. He carefully <br/>\nexamined my sword and made a few comments. His comment are as <br/>\nfollows. The blade was hand forged, not machine forged and not <br/>\netched with acid. He spoke in lenth about the temper of the blade <br/>\nand types of metal used. The tang of the sword had been shorted and <br/>\nreshaped from the original form. The overall shape and shape of the <br/>\npoint, was consistent with an older form (the blade narrows down to <br/>\na small point). I am seeking to learn the parts of the blade, and <br/>\nnot sound so much like a rookie. &lt;Laughs&gt;<br/>\n   He further told me some interesting things about the sword, and <br/>\nit these things that have caused my concern.  The mounting of the <br/>\nsword is consistent with special mountings used as presentation <br/>\nswords to be given to visiting German Officers. The said that about <br/>\n183 swords were remade as these presentation swords. The thing for <br/>\nme to worry about is that the swords used were in some cases family <br/>\nswords, some were obtained without the family&#39;s permission, and some <br/>\nwere donated because there was now aparent heirs. He went on to <br/>\nexplain that the family swords were in many cases not marked by the <br/>\nmaker or smith (no MEI). But a good clue to a family sword is the <br/>\nthe etching or engraving of a name on the blade. That is the name of <br/>\na warrior killed by the sword (and by placing the warriors name on <br/>\nthe blade, his soul is captured in the steel). Swords having these <br/>\nmarkings on the blade are very traceable, and there might be a legal <br/>\ndispute should someone in the family seek the return of the sword to <br/>\ntheir family.<br/>\n    I took the handle off the tang and photographed the parts of the <br/>\nsword as best I could. I will be posting the pictures in a photo <br/>\nfolder named GERMAN. I would like any comments on the blade directed <br/>\nto me personally. &lt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Ranox27157@...\">Ranox27157@...</a> &gt; Should it turn out that <br/>\nthis is one of the presentation swords, but without a legal issue, I <br/>\nwill either sell it or donate in to the loical WWII museum.</div>",
