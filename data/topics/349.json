Best of all, you <br/>\ncan get &#39;em from<br/>\namazon for $49.99 - look for digital blue QX3.<br/>\n<br/>\nNot as good as a top grade microscope with the camera port, but hey, it <br/>\ndidn&#39;t cost<br/>\n3 grand either...<br/>\n<br/>\nCheck it out...<br/>\n<br/>\nrkg<br/>\n(Richard George)</div>",
