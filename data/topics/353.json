Toppei I believe refers to the <br/>\nshape of the kashira and kojiri IE; tapering. I agree with all that <br/>\nJim has said, I believe these were popular at the tail end of the Edo <br/>\nperiod when Western weapons and tactics were being fervently studied <br/>\nby the Japanese.<br/>\n\tThis style of koshirae could be used with hakama or European <br/>\ntrousers, hence the swivel often seen. The swivelling &quot;kurikata&quot; <br/>\nallowed the sword to be thrust thru the Obi or slung &quot;backward&quot; in <br/>\nwestern fashion when dressed in pants.<br/>\n\tThe gunto koshirae is an extension of this idea and one can <br/>\nsee how many different ways were invented to allow quick conversion <br/>\nfrom saber to uchigatana...<br/>\n\tMore often than not these are of superior workmanship. My <br/>\nbelief is that the new officers of the newly formed rifle or <br/>\nartillery units went for this style and most of them with the money <br/>\nto get a special set up like this were likely sons of the Bakufu. <br/>\nThere is one memorable example of this style which is decidedly <br/>\ncommon, showing rough simple work suitable more for a foot soldier <br/>\nthan an officer; That would be Saigo Takamoris&#39; shuzaya toppei <br/>\ngoshirae which carried a gimei Muramasa blade.<br/>\n\tI think this little tanto exhibits all the features of a <br/>\nquality koshirae in this style. There is one more feature not yet <br/>\nmentioned and that is that Toppei koshirae typically feature iron <br/>\nfittings with silver inlay (sometimes gold).<br/>\n\tThat really is all I know (or have been taught). Thirsting for more,<br/>\nTom</div>",

            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1155976412\">Ron,<br/>\nKoshirae with that kind of spring clip are usually (maybe always) fitted with a ring rather than a traditional kurikata.  I don&#39;t know what the difference in use was, but there probably was a practical reason.  I don&#39;t have a firm understanding of toppei koshirae, but at least some of these examples with the external spring clip were apparently made for wear with Western-style clothing.  Some toppei koshirae without a spring clip still have a ring-swivel fitting instead of a kurikata.  Others have a fixed or swivel ring mounted on the &quot;edge&quot; rather than the side of the saya.  I think that the sageo used was more like a string rather than a flat braid.  I suspect that they were worn at a different angle to the body and possibly there was a greater risk of the sword falling out of the saya, hence the clip.  I don&#39;t know much about them.  Tom, any ideas?<br/>\n<br/>\nEtched soft metal isn&#39;t a very common technique.  Good lacquer and an interesting wrap, too.  It would fit right in the Edo no Tanto Koshirae picture book.<br/>\nJim<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Jim:<br/>\n<br/>\n  Thanks for the compliment!<br/>\n<br/>\n  Soft metal fittings that were etched.<br/>\n  It has a ring, not kurikata.
