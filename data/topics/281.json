The iron parrying bars would have taken care of other blades.  I don&#39;t recall anything about the leather plate that would suggest that it wasn&#39;t contemporary with the rest of the mounting, but my memory of it isn&#39;t good enough to base an argument on.  There is a somewhat similar koshirae at the bottom of page 82 of Bottomley and Hopson&#39;s &quot;Arms and Armor of the Samurai.&quot;  Scanned here for your convenience:<br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://tinyurl.com/dd82\">http://tinyurl.com/dd82</a><br/>\n<br/>\n  I suppose it&#39;s possible that someone transplanted a shinai tsuba onto the nagamaki koshirae.  But on the other hand if you set out to make a round leather guard to go on a round wooden stick, I&#39;m not sure how one for a nagamaki pole would or should look different from one for a shinai.  Any ideas?<br/>\n<br/>\n  If we were talking about a loose guard not associated with a koshirae, I&#39;d agree with Mo that it&#39;s much more likely to have been from a shinai or bokken than a nagamaki.  But this one did come on a nagamaki and we have other examples of pole arms mounted like this with a hand guard on the pole and parrying bars either mounted on the nakago or on the pole.

The kawa tsuba has delaminated like those at Oyamazumi, but the upper half is still wrapped in what looks like a cloth bag.  I&#39;m not sure if there are any traces of lacquer remaining.  There are o-seppa.

It is 3.5  inches in diameter and .25 inches thick.  It is made from two pieces of leather and it appears that there may be a fabric covering under the lacquer..you can see a weave looking design on the edges where the lacquer is cracked away.  This particular tsuba fit on the pole about a foot behind the blade.  There is a four pointed iron guard device that goes in front of it.  I don&#39;t have the whole pole, but I do have all the forward parts.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n  Jim<br/>\n<br/>\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!
