I found other inlay types which seem to be &quot;true inlay&quot; called ipsa, iyabsa and unipsa.  The last two were for silver inlay on steel, but the description sounded more like hira-zogan.  I didn&#39;t have any success searching for more information on poe-mock saang-gum or choum iybsa.  Perhaps someone with Korean language skills could find more.  Anyone?<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is quite a bit of information on kum-boo (or keum-boo, kum-bu) which is a gold to silver heat fusion technique that seems to be popular with contemporary metalworkers.  Nothing to do with nunome though.<br/>\n<br/>\nJim<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Does anyone know the Korean word for such stuff, by the way?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>",
