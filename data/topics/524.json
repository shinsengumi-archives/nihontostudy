The hand-written original has<br/>\n&gt; long been lost, but over the years numerous hand-copies were made among<br/>\n&gt; tsuba and sword enthusiasts.

This book is<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; result of that effort. Original text and illustrations (taken from several<br/>\n&gt; reliable copies in existence) are duplicated in large pages, and modern<br/>\n&gt; typesetting was added to enable today&#39;s audience to read the cursive<br/>\n&gt; classical writing.

I can even supply a picture, because I put photos whenever<br/>\npossible of Japanese language titles into my bibliography, which I need to<br/>\navoid duplicate acquisitions.  Koshoyama found me a copy.<br/>\n<br/>\nKanzan, Matsumiya. Tsuba shokan koketsu, 7.5&quot; x 10.5&quot;, 210 pages. Estimated<br/>\nto be authored in 1736, &quot;Tsuba shokan koketsu&quot; is said to be the oldest<br/>\nmonograph on the appreciation of the tsuba. The hand-written original has<br/>\nlong been lost, but over the years numerous hand-copies were made among<br/>\ntsuba and sword enthusiasts. Since the extant copies were becoming scarce<br/>\nand out of reach of average tsuba enthusiasts, Shibata Mitsuo undertook the<br/>\nproject of publishing the book in a modern format in 1967. This book is the<br/>\nresult of that effort. Original text and illustrations (taken from several<br/>\nreliable copies in existence) are duplicated in large pages, and modern<br/>\ntypesetting was added to enable today&#39;s audience to read the cursive<br/>\nclassical writing. The direct translation of the title is &quot;Orally<br/>\ntransmitted secret of the appreciation of the tsuba,&quot; but &quot;How to Appreciate<br/>\nthe Tsuba&quot; would be much more appropriate for the content.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\nFrom: &quot;arnold frenzel&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:afrenzel@...\">afrenzel@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jdz@...\">jdz@...</a>&gt;; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:token_kenkyu_kai@...\">token_kenkyu_kai@...</a>&gt;;<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com\">nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Monday, March 21, 2005 9:29 AM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [nihontostudy] papering tsuba<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Hi:<br/>\n&gt;  That is any excellent set of questions.

Today, I would only submit a tsuba to shinsa if the signature was important enough to make the tsuba &quot;valuable&quot; enough to justify the costs. One tsuba here that I&#39;m considering sending to shinsa is mumei but if judged &quot;Akasaka&quot; and perhaps designated to a particular generation, in my eyes, it would justify the cost of shinsa. Bob Benson mentioned awhile back that a lot of people are acquiring only Hozon papers and not bothering with paying for Tokubetsu shinsa, simply to &quot;confirm&quot; the mei. <br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally, I am an advocate of papers being gotten on &quot;priority&quot; items in my collection. <br/>\n<br/>\nRon<br/>\nSTL<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: alchemyst <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com\">nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Thursday, July 10, 2003 12:24 PM<br/>\n  Subject: [nihontostudy] Re: papering tsuba<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Ken -<br/>\n<br/>\n  My feeble thoughts on the topic.

Cary suggested it<br/>\nwould be best to submit these in Japan and it got me<br/>\nthinking about many questions surrounding this<br/>\nprocess.  I don&#39;t recall a lot of discussion around<br/>\nfittings submission, but there have been many<br/>\ndiscussions on submiting swords. So I thought it would<br/>\nbe helpful (for at least some of us or at least me).<br/>\n1.  When is it worth submitting fittings to shinsa?  I<br/>\nunderstand the value of knowledge but aren&#39;t fees a<br/>\nlittle high for fittings in relation to swords? <br/>\n2. Is the process similiar to swords, must submit<br/>\nseveral times for higher papers? <br/>\n2.  What criteria would you use? for example, price: a<br/>\n$250 tsuba may not but a $500 would? or age a late edo<br/>\npiece isn&#39;t worth it?<br/>\n3.  A sword with papers usually increases value (often<br/>\ngreatly(?)).  How much would this apply to tsuba<br/>\nand/or fittings in general?<br/>\n4. What kind of conditions must your tsuba be in for a<br/>\nreal consideration? patina, rust, missing inlay, etc? <br/>\n5. Does age factor into condition, ie koto swords may<br/>\nhave certain flaws overlooked in the papering process<br/>\nbut shinto would not, does this translate over to<br/>\ntsuba?<br/>\n<br/>\nAll comments are appreciated.  By the way, the 2 tsuba<br/>\nI was questioning are located in the other yahoo list<br/>\nfolder under mantis (I think labeled &quot;11 &1&quot;) which<br/>\nwere recently shared with on that list.  Anyone else<br/>\ninterested I will gladly send pics of.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThank you<br/>\nKen<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nSBC Yahoo!
