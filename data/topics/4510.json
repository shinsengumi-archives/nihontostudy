The key is of<br/>\ncourse recognition. Do many people recognize your style as having<br/>\npractical, spiritual and cultural value, enough that your style will<br/>\ncontinue long after your passing. Do otherwise uniterested parties<br/>\nrecognize what you are doing as Japanese Swordsmanship or at least<br/>\nswordsmanship. Finally does the pioneer himself recognize the<br/>\ncontributions of past masters, and that it takes really big cahones to<br/>\npronounce to the world they have broken with tradition and started his<br/>\nown way and how that might rub folks the wrong way no matter how good<br/>\nor how logical his new style may be.<br/>\n<br/>\nyou might go to the Iaido/l list at the University of Guelph, or<br/>\nswordforum.com for some other opinions.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou didn&#39;t ask but, my advice would be to align yourself with an<br/>\nestablish tradition, then work hard and if you&#39;re lucky enough, open<br/>\nyour own dojo. You get to teach what you like and you&#39;re students will<br/>\nbe part of something bigger than the backyard Ryuha. and for goodness<br/>\nsakes if you aren&#39;t Japanese don&#39;t give it a Japanese name...<br/>\nMHO<br/>\n-t</div>",
