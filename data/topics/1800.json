            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-494094924\">Dear Matt and Ron,<br/>\n      I am very tardy in picking up this thread, but I am glad that someone<br/>\nhas surfaced this topic once again. It comes up every so often, but there<br/>\ndoes not seem to be enough material - either documentary or material - to<br/>\nput it to rest.<br/>\n      The book that Ron mentioned is called simply &quot;Sawasa&quot; ISBN 90 400<br/>\n9279 6. It was published by the Rijkmuseum in Amsterdam. In addition to a<br/>\nbunch of other stuff, it shows about a half dozen Japanese mounted western<br/>\nswords. These are either smallswords or hangers and they are NEAT! I would<br/>\nlove to have one. Indeed, I have kept my eye open for one of these for<br/>\nseveral years, but have not be able to snag one.  I attended a sale at<br/>\nChristies in London some years back and watched a beauty sell so I know<br/>\nthat they are out there ...  and that i can&#39;t afford them. Most studies of<br/>\nEuropean small swords include mention of these swords, but I have never<br/>\nseen them treated in Japanese literature, As you point out, Matt, they are<br/>\nclearly made with Japanese style, iconography, and techniques. I agree that<br/>\nthey seem &quot;Mino&quot; but that scould be simply because of the fine shakudo<br/>\nwork.<br/>\nI urge you to keep you eye open for these in the Dutch market. Often they<br/>\nare called either &quot;Tonkinese&quot; or &quot;Chinese&quot; but I think there can be no<br/>\nquestion that they were made in Japan. Obviously, if you find any of these<br/>\nthat you do NOT wish to own, I hope you will contact me first!<br/>\n      I love finding evidence that Japanese swords havelong been part of<br/>\nthe larger world and this seems to be one of those times. These swords show<br/>\nthat the world of the17th and 18th century knew that the Japanese were<br/>\nmaking some beautiful swords.<br/>\nPeter<br/>\n<br/>\nPeter Bleed<br/>\nAssociate Dean<br/>\nCollege of Arts and Sciences<br/>\n1223 Oldfather Hall<br/>\nUniversity of Nebraska<br/>\nLincoln, NE 68588-0312<br/>\n(402) 472-2891</div>",

ISBN 90<br/>\n400 9279 6.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have seen some of these pieces in person and the work is quite<br/>\ndifferent from Mino, although I see what you&#39;re thinking.  I&#39;m not aware<br/>\nof anything documenting who the specific makers were.  They weren&#39;t<br/>\nnecessarily nihonto fittings makers.  All sorts of decorative items were<br/>\nmade in this style, boxes, bowls, buttons, buckles, tea services, pipes,<br/>\netc.  You should be able to see some examples at the Rijksmuseum in<br/>\nAmsterdam.

It seems that tsuba makers also<br/>\nmade shakudo hilts for Rapiers and Short Swords for the Dutch in the<br/>\nearly 18th cent. I have included an excerpt below from the book I am<br/>\nreading at the moment:<br/>\n<br/>\n[On the topic of Short Swords]<br/>\n<br/>\n&#39;The Dutch also traded with Japan and as a result a variety of wares<br/>\nmade by Japanese craftsmen were carried back to the West. These included<br/>\nhilts makde of shakudo, a mixture of copper and gold, and patinated to a<br/>\nrich blue colour to contrast with the gilded panels of relief<br/>\ndecorations set at intervals on the guard, knucklebow and pommel. As<br/>\nwith the ivory hilts from Ceylon, contemporary Dutch hilts were the<br/>\nprototypes for these exotic pieces. The craftsmen who made them were<br/>\nspecialists in tsuba, Japanese sword guards, and came from the area<br/>\naround Nagasaki. The majority of these exotic hilts echo standard<br/>\nsmallsword or hunting sword hilts of the 1700&#39;s but hilt forms of the<br/>\n1750&#39;s were also copied.&#39;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe author then goes on to illustrate such a Japanese shakudo hilt. It<br/>\nactually kind of looks a tiny bit like Mino work. Very remarkable. Now<br/>\nhas anyone ever seen any of these items first hand? Is this phenomenon<br/>\ndocumented? Do we know which tsuba makers got involved in this new<br/>\nbusiness?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd since the Dutch were ordering them back in the 18th cent, I might<br/>\nwant to keep my eyes peeled other here, to see if any turn up at auction<br/>\nor a local antiquefair (I am in The Netherlands).

It seems that tsuba makers also<br/>\nmade shakudo hilts for Rapiers and Short Swords for the Dutch in the<br/>\nearly 18th cent. I have included an excerpt below from the book I am<br/>\nreading at the moment:<br/>\n<br/>\n[On the topic of Short Swords]<br/>\n<br/>\n&#39;The Dutch also traded with Japan and as a result a variety of wares<br/>\nmade by Japanese craftsmen were carried back to the West. These included<br/>\nhilts makde of shakudo, a mixture of copper and gold, and patinated to a<br/>\nrich blue colour to contrast with the gilded panels of relief<br/>\ndecorations set at intervals on the guard, knucklebow and pommel. As<br/>\nwith the ivory hilts from Ceylon, contemporary Dutch hilts were the<br/>\nprototypes for these exotic pieces. The craftsmen who made them were<br/>\nspecialists in tsuba, Japanese sword guards, and came from the area<br/>\naround Nagasaki. The majority of these exotic hilts echo standard<br/>\nsmallsword or hunting sword hilts of the 1700&#39;s but hilt forms of the<br/>\n1750&#39;s were also copied.&#39;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe author then goes on to illustrate such a Japanese shakudo hilt. It<br/>\nactually kind of looks a tiny bit like Mino work. Very remarkable. Now<br/>\nhas anyone ever seen any of these items first hand? Is this phenomenon<br/>\ndocumented? Do we know which tsuba makers got involved in this new<br/>\nbusiness?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd since the Dutch were ordering them back in the 18th cent, I might<br/>\nwant to keep my eyes peeled other here, to see if any turn up at auction<br/>\nor a local antiquefair (I am in The Netherlands). I would be so lucky<br/>\nhahahahaha..<br/>\n<br/>\nRegards, Matthew<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    Z Recruiting Services<br/>\n    “Zurich Toren” Muzenstraat 89<br/>\n    2511 WB Den Haag<br/>\n    T: +31 70 4262273<br/>\n    F: +31 70 4262111<br/>\n    W: zrecruiting.com<br/>\n    E: info@...<br/>\n    Kijk ook op monsterboard.nl, jobbingmall.nl en<br/>\n    nationalevacaturebank.nl voor actuele vacatures!<br/>\n<br/>\n---<br/>\nOutgoing mail is certified Virus Free.<br/>\nChecked by AVG anti-virus system (http://www.grisoft.com).<br/>\nVersion: 6.0.648 / Virus Database: 415 - Release Date: 31-3-2004<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYahoo!
