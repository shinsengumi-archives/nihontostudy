            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-969343322\">Yes, very interesting. But I think cart before the horse. As the <br/>\nearly swordsmiths made their own tsuba with sword to hand and could <br/>\nbe fitted in situ the use of shims of any form would be unnecessary. <br/>\nAs swords are forged by a particular smith the general dimensions <br/>\nwould have been consistent and the nakago-ana would have been made <br/>\nconsistent to these dimensions. As the fabrication of tsuba became a <br/>\ncottage industry, dependent on the swordsmith hence the close <br/>\nproximity of them, the tsuba-ko had to fit their tsuba not knowing <br/>\nwhat measurements they may see and the sekigane shims developed. The <br/>\neffect that had on the ability to absorb shock or reduce wear would <br/>\nhave been a subsequent discovery. Also may I suggest that sekigane <br/>\nmay have been added to some tsuba later that had worn loose to <br/>\ntighten the tsuka as well as adding seppa.The rattle of a loose <br/>\ntsuba is extremely annoying. These are just my take on the possible <br/>\ndevelopment of such. <br/>\nJohn                                                                 <br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com\">nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Jim Gilbert&quot; &lt;jggilbert@...&gt; <br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m up to date on email...not.
