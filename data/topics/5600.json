I sold a very masculine wakizashi by nidai Hizen Yukihiro in September 2003; the buyer wanted to make up a daisho. The sword was later sold again, from what I hear, and today, is probably in one of your collections, I suspect. I&#39;ve come across a full-length oshigata of the sword (made by me) that I suspect the present owner would enjoy having. I&#39;d be happy to give it to them if &quot;he&quot; can be found. The sword was in polish, shirasaya, ubu and so fresh it looked like a gendai-to! Wide hamon with much nie, ara nie, splashing over the blade. I&#39;m not sure, but the second seller could had been Bill Miller??? <br/>\n<br/>\nIf it sounds familiar, contact me off list please: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:swords@...\">swords@...</a> <br/>\n<br/>\nRon<br/>\nSTL<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
