            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-858222120\">Elliott - <br/>\n<br/>\nYou missed a nice weekend. I hear the show was once again a sell-out show with loads of goodies to fondle at all the tables. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I enjoyed so very much was the talks and exhibits that were presented. Gordon Robson (NTHK) presented an interesting exhibit and talk on swords and fittings from Mino province which was quite educational. Then there was a wonderful exhibit presented by Bob Benson and the NBTHK-American branch on &quot;tanto.&quot; Around twenty fine tanto were laid out for our study showing the changes in form and treatment over the centuries. This was quite educational, to see Kamakura work and then Muromachi and later, Muromachi copies of Kamakura works. <br/>\n<br/>\nThen there was a super exhibit of fittings entitled &quot;Machibori&quot; which was assembled and presented by Mike Yamasaki. Unbelievable quality of fittings were represented! As Mike pointed out, the name &quot;Machibori&quot; is taken (outside of Japan) as more common &quot;street carver&#39;s work&quot; when in reality, it does not mean &quot;lower quality&quot; work at all. The items exhibited and explained in Mikes illustrated catalogue (in color) were super in quality and carried many famous names. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe NBTHK-American branch also held a kantei session for members laying out four blades for our judgment, always a challenge!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was simply a great weekend. Saturday&#39;s banquet for tableholders was yummy and appreciated, judging from the overflowing plates some guys carried away. The unfortunate part of the weekend was that the hotel was under construction as they remodeled the lobby bar/first floor area. It was a mess!!! However, everyone adapted quickly and the temporary bar area (in the casual restaurant area) was full of merrymakers at the end of the evening after the show closed at ten. Fun times!<br/>\n<br/>\nRon<br/>\nSTL<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Elliott <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com\">nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Sunday, August 19, 2007 6:37 PM<br/>\n  Subject: [nihontostudy] SF Token Kai<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  I missed the SF show and feel really bad.
