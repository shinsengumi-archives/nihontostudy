This shinsa was a bit different and we couldn&#39;t have done it without the people who stepped up to the job.  Moses Becerra, Tom Helm, Arnold Frenzel, John White, Fred Geyer and Bob Holcomb gave up most or all of their &quot;show time&quot; to make the shinsa happen, including some late night and very early morning hours for a few on Thursday/Friday.  I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll kick myself soon for forgetting to mention someone by name, but big thanks to all who did the work.<br/>\n<br/>\nJim  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Jim,<br/>\n<br/>\n  please klick...........<br/>\n<br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://tinyurl.com/7xc7z\">http://tinyurl.com/7xc7z</a><br/>\n<br/>\n  I am quite  pleasantly surprised that the tsuba was given an <br/>\n  attribution of &quot; mid edo Hoan &quot; by the shinsa team headed by Hagihara <br/>\n  sensei.<br/>\n  I recall we discussed this tsuba long time ago on this list that this <br/>\n  is most likely  a Shoami on an average day or a Umetada ( or <br/>\n  Myochin ) on a very very good day.<br/>\n<br/>\n  You mentioned briefly that it has something to do with the beveling <br/>\n  of the guard which I don&#39;t quite understand.
