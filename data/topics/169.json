He is carrying an uchigatana with a tsuba, however it&#39;s rather difficult to say whether it might be made of iron, yamagane or leather.<br/>\n<br/>\nGordon - do you have any sort of image of the nagamaki tsuba?  Is it a plain iron plate without sukashi?<br/>\n<br/>\nJim<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Hi Richard,<br/>\n<br/>\n  The fuchi-kashira are MIno in style. Can&#39;t tell much about the menuki or the<br/>\n  tsuba, which appears to be iron. Kozuka is also difficult to tell much<br/>\n  about. Unfortunately, when my daughter was home the last time with her<br/>\n  boyfriend, they switched my internet connnection to Opera, which only reads<br/>\n  English, so I can&#39;t read the Japanese text.<br/>\n  On a slightly different note getting back to the use of Ko-Tosho and<br/>\n  Ko-Katchushi tsuba, I had mentioned Sasano&#39;s ideas about this. This morning<br/>\n  I took another look at his book Tosogu no Kigen or Origins of Sword Fittings<br/>\n  (actually, Katana Fittings). One of the illustrations he cites is the Ban<br/>\n  Daiagon scroll, which shows an elderly foot solider with an uchigatana that<br/>\n  has a tsuba. This scroll dates to the late Heian period. There are other<br/>\n  warriors with shorter blades -- koshigatana? -- that are without tsuba.<br/>\n  There is also a plain round iron tsuba that would be called a Ko-Tosho that<br/>\n  was mounted on a nagamaki. We know this because the seppa were rusted to the<br/>\n  tsuba and they are large and round of the type that would be for a nagamaki<br/>\n  handle. The tsuba is very large at 9.3 cent. across. Anyway, just thought I<br/>\n  would share this.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Gordon<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",

            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1388729781\">Hi Richard,<br/>\n<br/>\nThe fuchi-kashira are MIno in style. Can&#39;t tell much about the menuki or the<br/>\ntsuba, which appears to be iron. Kozuka is also difficult to tell much<br/>\nabout. Unfortunately, when my daughter was home the last time with her<br/>\nboyfriend, they switched my internet connnection to Opera, which only reads<br/>\nEnglish, so I can&#39;t read the Japanese text.<br/>\nOn a slightly different note getting back to the use of Ko-Tosho and<br/>\nKo-Katchushi tsuba, I had mentioned Sasano&#39;s ideas about this. This morning<br/>\nI took another look at his book Tosogu no Kigen or Origins of Sword Fittings<br/>\n(actually, Katana Fittings). One of the illustrations he cites is the Ban<br/>\nDaiagon scroll, which shows an elderly foot solider with an uchigatana that<br/>\nhas a tsuba. This scroll dates to the late Heian period. There are other<br/>\nwarriors with shorter blades -- koshigatana? -- that are without tsuba.<br/>\nThere is also a plain round iron tsuba that would be called a Ko-Tosho that<br/>\nwas mounted on a nagamaki. We know this because the seppa were rusted to the<br/>\ntsuba and they are large and round of the type that would be for a nagamaki<br/>\nhandle. The tsuba is very large at 9.3 cent. across. Anyway, just thought I<br/>\nwould share this.<br/>\n<br/>\nGordon<br/>\n----------<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Richard Turner&quot; &lt;ikkanshi@...&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com&gt;<br/>\nSubject: [nihontostudy] Great Koshirae<br/>\nDate: Sun, 4 May 2003 20:27:19 +0800<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHi all, this site was bought to my attention and I found this Wak.
