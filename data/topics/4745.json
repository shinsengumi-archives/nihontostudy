Please note, it is $65 priority shipped FOR U.S.A. ADDRESS. Paypal works fine. (Shipping to Canada, etc., costs more to do from here. Other local KTK members can fill those requests.) <br/>\n<br/>\nHopefully those who have gotten their copy are pleased with them. Nice Christmas or holiday gift idea at a very reasonable price!

A new supply has come in and are now available. To simplify shipping, I decided to make these available to U.S. addresses at $65 post paid shipped priority mail. (Arrival probably in time for Christmas, in case any wives or sweeties are reading this.)<br/>\n<br/>\nPayment by Paypal to my account (Ron Hartmann <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:-swords@...\">-swords@...</a>) is easy, or send me a check at: 5907 Deerwood Drive, St. Louis, MO 63123-2707. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyone outside the U.S.A. can hopefully get them from a nearby KTK member. Those members on the List could make this known. (If must be, I can figure shipping outside the states but that&#39;s usually expensive and kind of a pain at the post office.)<br/>\n<br/>\nHere is a brief review of the catalogue by a Pete Klein (from a copy supplied by KTK member Richard Turner...<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://tinyurl.com/y4el2e\">http://tinyurl.com/y4el2e</a><br/>\n<br/>\nAny further question, email me privately and I&#39;ll try to answer them. When this group sells, I&#39;ll fade off into the sunset...<br/>\n<br/>\nRon<br/>\nSTL<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>",
