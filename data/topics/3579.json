And finally, this piece wasn&#39;t <br/>\ndated, but has no arsenal stamps - should<br/>\nI be worried that this is one of those pieces described in Kapp&#39;s where <br/>\nthey manage to get a nice hizenish<br/>\nhada/nie by careful treatment of modern materials?<br/>\n<br/>\nAny comments would be greatly appreciated.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\n<br/>\nrkg<br/>\n(Richard George)</div>",
