Akiyama, who died in 1936, was the foremost<br/>\nresearcher on tsuba, particularly iron. of his day, and has left a<br/>\nlasting impression on the categorization of tsuba to this day. He<br/>\ncollected dozens and dozens of oshigata of Nobuiye, some very<br/>\nunassuming, as was the found one I refereed to, and they were published<br/>\nby a Mr. Nakayama, or Nakamura or something close to that (only my poor<br/>\nbrain as a reference here). When you see one like the example you asked<br/>\nabout, what makes me suspicious is the &quot;pulled out of the fire&quot; look it<br/>\nhas and the lack of depth and sharpness to the chisel work. Those done<br/>\nby the Norisuke, I and II, often look quite good, but they must be<br/>\nexamined in hand. They often are deficient on the part of the mimi you<br/>\ndon&#39;t see from a photograph, as it is said they tended to work from<br/>\nbooks that did not illustrate the sides, or that is one story I have<br/>\nheard.<br/>\n There are many many gimei Owari Nobuiye out there as his work was very<br/>\nmuch in vogue during the early 19th Cent. revival period. One the other<br/>\nhand there were other, entirely legitimate Nobuiye working elsewhere,<br/>\nand they are entirely worthy collectors&#39; pieces in many cases. <br/>\n The dealer, that should probably remain confidential to him.<br/>\n I hope this helps.<br/>\n Arnold<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:matthewhoyle@...\">matthewhoyle@...</a> 01/31/05 4:41 PM &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Hi Arnold, thanks for the response. Did you mean the book that these<br/>\nscans<br/>\ncame from? <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.jpsword.com/files/kn/nobuiye.html\">http://www.jpsword.com/files/kn/nobuiye.html</a><br/>\nThis webpage is very good for making side by side comparisons with the<br/>\npix<br/>\non Mr. Weissberg&#39;s website. I think I can see the sutble differences in<br/>\nthe<br/>\nmei now, or perhaps I want to believe I can *grin*. Some more pointers<br/>\nin<br/>\nthis direction might be good for me all the same. Are there any<br/>\nspecifics to<br/>\nlook for besides the &#39;softness&#39;?<br/>\n<br/>\nWith regards to the Akiyama tsuba that was found, the mind boggles how<br/>\nit<br/>\nwound up on a table at a sword show in the US among a pile of other<br/>\ntsuba!<br/>\n<br/>\nMatt<br/>\n<br/>\nPs.

The first thing one would<br/>\n&gt; what to do is to consult the book of Akiyama collected Nobuiye (title<br/>\n&gt; escapes me without reference material here) which illustrates the vast<br/>\n&gt; bulk of know Nobuiye out there. A few years ago a well known<br/>\nCalifornia<br/>\n&gt; dealer was lucky enough to find one at a show, bought it and it<br/>\n&gt; eventually went Juyo. Sure enough is found among the Akiyama oshigata.<br/>\n&gt; You can be quite sure that if such a tsuba left Japan and were correct<br/>\n&gt; the price would have at least another zero on the end, and probably an<br/>\n&gt; initial digit change as well.<br/>\n&gt;  Arnold<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:matthewhoyle@...\">matthewhoyle@...</a> 01/30/05 5:32 PM &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Gimei Nobuiye?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.nihonto.com/11.28.04.html\">http://www.nihonto.com/11.28.04.html</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Mr. Weissberg evidently thinks it is gimei, my question is how can you<br/>\n&gt; tell?<br/>\n&gt; It looks awfully similar to the ones in the books!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; And if it is indeed gimei, how old is it do we think?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Matt<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!
