I have an old friend staying with me<br/>\nand haven&#39;t had much time to devote to the list.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only koshirae mounted with Ko Katchushi or Ko Tosho tsuba that I have<br/>\nseen in person or in illustrations were typical mid to late Muromachi katana<br/>\nor wakizashi.  I have not seen an early tachi mounted with these guards.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost of the early tachi koshirae that have been preserved seem to have been<br/>\nfor formal wear and these are fitted with relatively elaborate soft metal<br/>\nguards.  There are many practical tachi preserved at Oyamazumi, and some<br/>\nothers in existence elsewhere, and they are mounted with nerikawa tsuba.  It<br/>\nseems that early tosho and katchushi guards were intended for practical use,<br/>\nbut it is not clear to me that they were ever mounted on tachi despite some<br/>\nreferences claiming this.  I&#39;ll try to get back to the possible use of some<br/>\nof these tsuba on naginata or nagimaki, but I don&#39;t think that the majority<br/>\nwere mounted on pole arms.<br/>\n<br/>\nReading ahead through the email list, Gordon is of course correct about<br/>\nSasano&#39;s interpretation of the picture scrolls and his construction of a<br/>\nchronological sequence from extant iron guards.  I don&#39;t think that any of<br/>\nthese very early katana or koshirae still exist.  I have to wonder why the<br/>\ntsuba still exist and why so many of the supposed early examples have<br/>\nwakizashi-style kozuka ana that are considered to have been added later.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s late and I&#39;m out of steam again...  more to follow when time permits.<br/>\nJim<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Jim-<br/>\n   .......<br/>\n        I am curious about your thoughts on the use of and changes in <br/>\n  the tsuba. Early kenukigata tachi and ito maki tachi have thick soft <br/>\n  metal or kawa tsuba, many of these are seen in the catalogs. What <br/>\n  mounts do we see the big perfectly circular Kokatchushi and Kotosho <br/>\n  tsuba on? In your minds eye what king of mount do you see these on?I <br/>\n  could see these large rather thin plates being useful say on <br/>\n  horseback, when blade to blade combat would have occurred less often. <br/>\n  But as Richard says once we move from tachi to katana, don&#39;t the <br/>\n  tsuba have smaller diameters and become a bit thicker? what is the <br/>\n  progression as you see it?<br/>\n        Kyo-sukashi ostensibly was the rage in the capitol, where <br/>\n  artistic merit surely held sway, these pieces made for the elite may <br/>\n  have seen battle but were seen as worthy of preservation early on. I <br/>\n  am thinking the workingmans&#39; sword guard would be more along the <br/>\n  lines of a Hoan, very simple iron and were used up or even tossed out <br/>\n  in favor of the latest fad.<br/>\n  -t<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYahoo!

A whole series of fees had to be paid, divination done, the<br/>\n  officials involved had to agree on a schedule, lunch had to be<br/>\n  ordered and an agenda that wouldn&#39;t allow for any embarrassment set<br/>\n  up. It wasn&#39;t like a carwash, where you drop off your sword and come<br/>\n  back later. It had to be done in just such a way. My understanding<br/>\n  has always been that the testers used special &quot;testing tsuka&quot; and no<br/>\n  tsuba, and probably made a big show of putting it on. I am inclined<br/>\n  to see thick tsuba as fashion and personal taste and not practical<br/>\n  (though surely they were sturdier than say kyosukashi pieces).<br/>\n        I am curious about your thoughts on the use of and changes in<br/>\n  the tsuba. Early kenukigata tachi and ito maki tachi have thick soft<br/>\n  metal or kawa tsuba, many of these are seen in the catalogs. What<br/>\n  mounts do we see the big perfectly circular Kokatchushi and Kotosho<br/>\n  tsuba on? In your minds eye what king of mount do you see these on?I<br/>\n  could see these large rather thin plates being useful say on<br/>\n  horseback, when blade to blade combat would have occurred less often.<br/>\n  But as Richard says once we move from tachi to katana, don&#39;t the<br/>\n  tsuba have smaller diameters and become a bit thicker? what is the<br/>\n  progression as you see it?<br/>\n        Kyo-sukashi ostensibly was the rage in the capitol, where<br/>\n  artistic merit surely held sway, these pieces made for the elite may<br/>\n  have seen battle but were seen as worthy of preservation early on. I<br/>\n  am thinking the workingmans&#39; sword guard would be more along the<br/>\n  lines of a Hoan, very simple iron and were used up or even tossed out<br/>\n  in favor of the latest fad.<br/>\n  -t<br/>\n<br/>\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!

These, at first glance look very large, just by their own dimensions. There is a Sukashi Katchushi Tsuba with the famous chrysanthemum design that is from the Nambokucho period. The size of the Nakago Ana and the hitsu and kozuka ana give the impression that the tsube would be roughly 4 &quot; or something like that across, it looks huge. ( the pic is on page 9 if anyone has it )This leeds me to more questions. <br/>\n<br/>\nWere Nakago that much smaller ( width and depth not length ) in the earlier periods than say the late Koto, early Shinto eras ?, giving the impression of bigger tsuba, or were the tsuba just bigger in some cases ?. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn most thing&#39;s we find, bigger is better, that is our way as collectors. All things being equal,  bigger swords are generally worth more than smallers ones. The same seems to apply to tsuba. Would that same mentality applied to the owners of these swords when they first had them made ?. Bigger looks better, show&#39;s greater wealth, looks more menacing ?<br/>\n<br/>\nDuring the waring periods when swinging a sword in battle was maybe a daily excersise, would a larger Tsuba have offered more protection, than a smaller tsuba ? or was it maybe a phycological advantage that the wielder had.<br/>\n<br/>\ncheers all<br/>\n<br/>\nRich <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",

            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-19611477\">Jim-<br/>\n\tIn my mind Edo period tameshi giri was a very ritualized <br/>\nactivity. A whole series of fees had to be paid, divination done, the <br/>\nofficials involved had to agree on a schedule, lunch had to be <br/>\nordered and an agenda that wouldn&#39;t allow for any embarrassment set <br/>\nup. It wasn&#39;t like a carwash, where you drop off your sword and come <br/>\nback later. It had to be done in just such a way. My understanding <br/>\nhas always been that the testers used special &quot;testing tsuka&quot; and no <br/>\ntsuba, and probably made a big show of putting it on. I am inclined <br/>\nto see thick tsuba as fashion and personal taste and not practical <br/>\n(though surely they were sturdier than say kyosukashi pieces).<br/>\n\tI am curious about your thoughts on the use of and changes in <br/>\nthe tsuba. Early kenukigata tachi and ito maki tachi have thick soft <br/>\nmetal or kawa tsuba, many of these are seen in the catalogs. What <br/>\nmounts do we see the big perfectly circular Kokatchushi and Kotosho <br/>\ntsuba on? In your minds eye what king of mount do you see these on?I <br/>\ncould see these large rather thin plates being useful say on <br/>\nhorseback, when blade to blade combat would have occurred less often. <br/>\nBut as Richard says once we move from tachi to katana, don&#39;t the <br/>\ntsuba have smaller diameters and become a bit thicker? what is the <br/>\nprogression as you see it?<br/>\n\tKyo-sukashi ostensibly was the rage in the capitol, where <br/>\nartistic merit surely held sway, these pieces made for the elite may <br/>\nhave seen battle but were seen as worthy of preservation early on. I <br/>\nam thinking the workingmans&#39; sword guard would be more along the <br/>\nlines of a Hoan, very simple iron and were used up or even tossed out <br/>\nin favor of the latest fad.<br/>\n-t<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",

            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1284112519\">Jim and all,<br/>\n<br/>\nThe fact that a tsuba is larger or smaller may play some small role in the use of a sword,  but not in cutting. I really can not imagine samurai sitting around discussing the weight of a tsuba and how it affects cutting, unless it is as heavy as a brick.  A tsuba offers some protection for your hand.  The only exception that I know about is that a very long sword is extremely difficult to draw if you have a large tsuba.  The tsuba  makes too much contact with your wrist.  So a small tsuba is best.  Now, what I have seen is a handle that has metal inlayed at the end of the tsuka past the nakago.  I have a shin shinto katana that is 32&quot; long.  It sounds very awkward to use but actually it is made in a interesting way.  The blade is slender and has fumbari and a strong curvature, also the stuba is leather with black lacquer over it and the tsuka has some kind of steel inlayed it at the end.  It is very noticeable.  The fact that the tsuba has almost no weight and the tsuka has extra weight added in the at the end of it makes this blade very nice to cut with.  At 32&quot; long it actually feel light.  I hope to write an article on this sword with pictures in the future when I have more time.<br/>\n<br/>\nRegards,<br/>\nMoses Becerra <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Jim Gilbert <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com\">nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Wednesday, April 23, 2003 8:56 PM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [nihontostudy] tsuba balance<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Tom sent in his subscription request, but hasn&#39;t confirmed it, so he<br/>\n  probably isn&#39;t getting email yet.
