You can see photos of contemporary mounts for the period in question<br/>\nin the Tokyo National Museum publication Uchigatana Koshirae. You will see<br/>\nthere that the earlier wraps are done in leather, typically a dark green or<br/>\nblue along with black and the lacquered over. The same is also lacquered<br/>\nblack and the saya are leather wrapped and also lacquered black. Tsuba are<br/>\ntypically plain iron, there is a simple fuchi, more decorative menuki,<br/>\nsometimes in gold or with a lot of gold foil coverings and a black-lacquered<br/>\nhorn kashira with the handle wrap going over the tip of the kashira. Katana<br/>\ntypically have a kogai in the saya and the saya have a distinctive round<br/>\nkurikata and an &quot;obi-hook.&quot; As you move into the Momoyama period wraps and<br/>\nsaya get gaudy with multicolored leather wraps, red saya and what not.

For an<br/>\nillustration and a more detailed explanation please see the link at the<br/>\nfoot of this email.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs part of our general aim to gradually improve the quality of all our<br/>\nequipment, one of our number Tracie Anderson, has been learning the art<br/>\nof kumihimo, and she has got quite good over the last few years. So much<br/>\nso, that her husband Simon, has decided that he wishes to have his sword<br/>\nrebound in a silk braid of her making. Likewise several others of our<br/>\ngroup are now beginning to form a disorderly queue.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, as to my first question; during the period 1500-1640 is there any<br/>\nevidence for tsuka ito being made with other than plain colours? <br/>\n<br/>\nAll the surviving examples that I&#39;ve seen to date, are bound with plain<br/>\ncolours, but this could be a function of later re-binding fashion, or<br/>\nthe fact that I have really poor eyesight:-) <br/>\n<br/>\nToday, you see in numerous kumihimo books, a huge range of multi-<br/>\ncoloured patterned braid, but they rarely if ever give a date for their<br/>\nintroduction. On armour you see the so-called &quot;woodpecker&quot; style used<br/>\nfor the mimi-ito and the herringbone type used as part of the trim on<br/>\nquality foundation fabrics, but that&#39;s it, as far as I know that is.<br/>\nI&#39;ve seen plenty of modern fancy sageo offered for iaitou, but I have no<br/>\nidea if this is an in-period or a modern feature.<br/>\n<br/>\nTracie has made flat braid with spiral, diamond, herring bone, and a<br/>\nhost of other patterns and is about to try her hand at woodpecker. She<br/>\ncan work with up to 16 different colours at the moment, but is having<br/>\nsome more bobbins made to enable her to go up to as many as 32 if needs<br/>\nbe.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs we are about to embark upon having several new custom weapons made<br/>\nhere in the UK, with decent iron fittings, including replica Owari<br/>\nsukashi tsuba, it would be nice to have all the braid hand made in<br/>\ncorrect period patterns (assuming they existed), so that they look more<br/>\nlike 16th/17th century swords rather than modern iaitou. Although the<br/>\nfittings are correctly hand forged here in the UK, the blades we use are<br/>\nsadly not traditionally crafted. They are individually made by a UK<br/>\nsmith, with blunt edges and durability as their prime requirement. This<br/>\nis because they are used for mock combat, which does involve some<br/>\ncontact. It would be a crime to wreck a correctly made piece of art in<br/>\nsuch an encounter, and that&#39;s leaving aside the issue of the expense.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow for my next question; is there any evidence for simple iron fittings<br/>\nfor tachi or han-dachi?<br/>\n<br/>\nAll the tachi that I have come across in books and museums, have been<br/>\nmounted with various forms of fine gilt fittings, which is only to be<br/>\nexpected, as the common run of the mill type equipment rarely survives<br/>\n(again assuming that they existed in the first place). Gilt fittings<br/>\nwould be of too high a quality for the class of warriors that we are<br/>\ncurrently trying to recreate. Most of us carry uchi-gatana as you would<br/>\nexpect, but it would be nice to have the option on mounting the blade in<br/>\nhan-dachi koshirae, or having a tachi made. I understand that some no-<br/>\ndachi were reputed to have had rather poor iron  fittings, but I have no<br/>\nidea if such things were ever applied to the tachi of the lower or<br/>\nmiddle ranking mounted warriors. <br/>\n<br/>\nIncidentally, we will be having a no-dachi made, starting very shortly,<br/>\nwhich should be finished in a few months, assuming everything goes well. <br/>\n<br/>\nFinally, a slightly frivolous question; in combat, the only swords we<br/>\nhave that actually &quot;ring&quot; upon their occasional contact with another,<br/>\nare of purely symmetrical design. Asymmetric weapons, like rapiers and<br/>\nkatana do not ring at all. Now in movies like the Twilight Samurai and<br/>\nRan, there can be heard the &quot;ching&quot; of blade to blade contact, leaving<br/>\naside any issue of technique, is this just the director having the<br/>\neffect dubbed in because the audience expect to hear it, or does the<br/>\nreal thing ring? My expectation is that they would not, for as I<br/>\nunderstand it, it is the energy oscillating to and fro across a<br/>\nsymmetrical weapon that produces the pure note, just like a bell. I ask,<br/>\nbecause when giving talks upon Japanese history etc. I often get asked<br/>\nwhy our swords do not ring as in the movies. I give the above<br/>\nexplanation, but if this failure to ring is merely a function of poorly<br/>\nmade replicas, and I&#39;m wrong about the real thing, I would really like<br/>\nto know, so I can avoid making a twit of myself in front of a<br/>\npotentially educated audience!<br/>\n<br/>\nOkay, that&#39;s it, any suggestions, advice, heckling?<br/>\n<br/>\nYours<br/>\n<br/>\nDean<br/>\n***<br/>\nDean Wayland<br/>\nHead Of The Fight School<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.thefightschool.demon.co.uk/SHOGUN.htm\">http://www.thefightschool.demon.co.uk/SHOGUN.htm</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\nYahoo!

It would be a crime to wreck a correctly made piece of art in<br/>\nsuch an encounter, and that&#39;s leaving aside the issue of the expense.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow for my next question; is there any evidence for simple iron fittings<br/>\nfor tachi or han-dachi?<br/>\n<br/>\nAll the tachi that I have come across in books and museums, have been<br/>\nmounted with various forms of fine gilt fittings, which is only to be<br/>\nexpected, as the common run of the mill type equipment rarely survives<br/>\n(again assuming that they existed in the first place). Gilt fittings<br/>\nwould be of too high a quality for the class of warriors that we are<br/>\ncurrently trying to recreate. Most of us carry uchi-gatana as you would<br/>\nexpect, but it would be nice to have the option on mounting the blade in<br/>\nhan-dachi koshirae, or having a tachi made. I understand that some no-<br/>\ndachi were reputed to have had rather poor iron  fittings, but I have no<br/>\nidea if such things were ever applied to the tachi of the lower or<br/>\nmiddle ranking mounted warriors. <br/>\n<br/>\nIncidentally, we will be having a no-dachi made, starting very shortly,<br/>\nwhich should be finished in a few months, assuming everything goes well. <br/>\n<br/>\nFinally, a slightly frivolous question; in combat, the only swords we<br/>\nhave that actually &quot;ring&quot; upon their occasional contact with another,<br/>\nare of purely symmetrical design. Asymmetric weapons, like rapiers and<br/>\nkatana do not ring at all. Now in movies like the Twilight Samurai and<br/>\nRan, there can be heard the &quot;ching&quot; of blade to blade contact, leaving<br/>\naside any issue of technique, is this just the director having the<br/>\neffect dubbed in because the audience expect to hear it, or does the<br/>\nreal thing ring? My expectation is that they would not, for as I<br/>\nunderstand it, it is the energy oscillating to and fro across a<br/>\nsymmetrical weapon that produces the pure note, just like a bell. I ask,<br/>\nbecause when giving talks upon Japanese history etc. I often get asked<br/>\nwhy our swords do not ring as in the movies. I give the above<br/>\nexplanation, but if this failure to ring is merely a function of poorly<br/>\nmade replicas, and I&#39;m wrong about the real thing, I would really like<br/>\nto know, so I can avoid making a twit of myself in front of a<br/>\npotentially educated audience!<br/>\n<br/>\nOkay, that&#39;s it, any suggestions, advice, heckling?<br/>\n<br/>\nYours<br/>\n<br/>\nDean<br/>\n***<br/>\nDean Wayland<br/>\nHead Of The Fight School<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.thefightschool.demon.co.uk/SHOGUN.htm\">http://www.thefightschool.demon.co.uk/SHOGUN.htm</a></div>",
