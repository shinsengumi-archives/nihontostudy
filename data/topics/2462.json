Some of the letters are correct, but others are upside down, backwards or simply made up.  Some resemble Greek letters.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis isn&#39;t Kunishige&#39;s work and the characters, whatever they are, are more &quot;freestyle&quot; than is usually seen in that type of nanban work.  A couple of the characters do resemble tensho script.  It&#39;s not one of the common nanban styles, but dote mimi examples do exist and the iron has the grainy quality seen in a lot of nanban tsuba.<br/>\n<br/>\nLate Hoan would usually be etched rather than carved.  The iron, finishing and carving don&#39;t look like Myochin, although they did make small, bold guards.  As always, seeing it in person could give a different impression.<br/>\n<br/>\nJim<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  All, yes, that was a responce I was puzzled by, thus I threw it out <br/>\n  there, here is another I have had and like<br/>\n<br/>\n  I believe they represent the most ancient form of Chinese characters. Oracle bone inscriptions from the <br/>\n  Shang -Zhou dynasty (2000-1000 BC)Stone drum inscriptions from the Warring states period (3rd cent. BC). <br/>\n  I have seen similar tsuba papered as later Hoan by the Fittings Museum.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I believe this tsuba may be a copy of something, there is a rather &#39;ODD&#39; feel to it, it is pretty light for it&#39;s size as well.<br/>\n<br/>\n  RIch<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",

There are tsuba where the seppa dai has been enlarged by<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; fitting pieces all of the way around.  Sometimes various pieces<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; (including the more common hitsuana plugs) are inserted by a later<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; collector to restore the look of the guard to something like what he<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; believes to be its original state.<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; I could imagine a piece like being inserted to repair damage if it<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; were somewhere else on the guard.  It&#39;s hard to imagine how that<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; particular spot would be damaged.<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; I have seen a fair number of tsuba that have a pronounced <br/>\n&gt; asymmetry to<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; the shape of the seppa dai in that location.  There is metal <br/>\n&gt; &quot;missing&quot;<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; from the same position at the upper right.  My guess is that at some<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; time and/or place a slightly asymmetrical tsuka or saya shape was in<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; style and that tsuba were either made or modified to accommodate that<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; shape.  I haven&#39;t come across such a koshirae and not being a sword<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; user I can&#39;t guess as to why such a shape might be desirable.<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; The insert on your guard might be an attempt to change one of these<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; tsuba to the more common symmetrical oval shape.<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; Any other ideas?<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; Jim<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;   Yahoo!
