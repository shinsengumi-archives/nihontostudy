This blade length is pretty typical for WWII swords. You might also check the cutting edge right at the habaki to see if this is sharp or flat; Most (but not all) WWII blades will have a dulled &quot;flat&quot; spot at this point. The blade looks in terrible shape and if you are unable to &quot;see some promise&quot; in the sword, let the next buyer take the gamble. Leave it alone and save your money for a better sword.  <br/>\n<br/>\nRon<br/>\nSTL<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Robert Gilmore <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com\">nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Wednesday, November 17, 2004 9:31 AM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [nihontostudy] Wakizaki question<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Patrik,<br/>\n<br/>\n  You can&#39;t tell much from the photos.
