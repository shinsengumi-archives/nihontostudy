Owari guards can show elongated or &quot;linear&quot; tekkotsu when compared to Kanayama&#39;s &quot;bumpy&quot; tekkotsu for example, but it looks quite different from senkotsu.

Later ones tend to be thinner.  The early Akasaka really favored a very &quot;high,&quot; rounded rim compared with other groups working at the same time.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Sometimes tekkotsu are seen in early examples.  Senkotsu is more common, which is a sort of long linear bone that forms where the inner and outer plates are joined.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  I&#39;m not sure if you intended there to be an attached photo.

It&#39;s quite easy.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Jim <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    Dear All,<br/>\n    I have been discussing the tsuba below with a number of friends from both this and another group. The concensus to date is that this is early Akasaka. While I am more than content with that attribution I was wondering how common the thick round mimi was in Aakasaka work? Also there are a lot of bones in the mimi. I understand that early Akasaka work was influenced by Owari tsuba, is this an example of this? or should I be looking in another direction.<br/>\n    All comments greatly appreciated.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    ---------------------------------<br/>\n    Want to chat instantly with your online friends?
