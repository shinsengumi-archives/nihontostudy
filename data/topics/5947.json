The link below is for that...\n            Anyone able to help out?<br>\n            <br>\n            Hi Swordfans, <br>\n            <br>\n            As we mentioned in an earlier post we are about to embark on\n            a new exciting project of a regular sword video magazine on\n            youtube. We are now an official Partner Channel, and have\n            access to the Youtube Space, in Roppongi Hills, Tokyo. As\n            with majority of free services we give to the public in our\n            efforts that are &quot;Dedicated to the Preservation and\n            Promotion of Japanese Swords, Swordsmiths and Related\n            Crafts&quot;, the Youtube &quot;The Japanese Sword Video Magazine&quot;\n            will also be free. However. you will have to suffer the\n            pesky ads (our apologies in advance). We do not ask for help\n            often here, but as this is a sizable project involving the\n            expertise from various people from different fields (music,\n            animation, translators &amp; subtitles, guests, guest\n            directors, and editors, volunteers, etc) we need your help\n            to ge<span class=\"ygrps-yiv-276439114text_exposed_show\">t it off the ground!!\n              We need specialist equipment, editing software, etc, etc.\n              <br>\n              <br>\n              We will be starting a Kickstarter page in the near future\n              with various sizes of Tamahagane as gifts (these will also\n              apply to the wishlist-we make the promise here). We are\n              aiming at first starting as a quarterly video magazine,\n              then as the team comes together, we hope to post more\n              frequently. Our segments will include educational items, a\n              regular fittings koza/review by Ford Hallam of Following\n              the iron brush, interviews with the many sword craftsmen\n              and scholars working today, explanations of great swords\n              by top Japanese scholars, top sword martial artists,\n              reports on sword events and news in Japan, and from around\n              the world. It is an chance to get a regular peek into the\n              sword world. With your support, it could be an exciting\n              project. In the meantime, we have started a wish list on\n              Amazon. There are some relatively inexpensive items there\n              too. We would be grateful for any help received. Also, we\n              are looking for any equipment/advertising sponsors. Or, if\n              you have any second hand equipment that suits our needs,\n              we would be grateful for that too. <br>\n              <br>\n              Let&#39;s get swording!<br>\n              <br>\n              Paul Martin<br>\n              The Japanese Sword</span></div>\n        </span></span></h5>\n    <br>\n  \n</html></div>",
