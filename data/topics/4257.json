Having come <br/>\n&gt; across an article by Thomas B. Buttweiler, &#39;The History of Pre-Edo <br/>\n&gt; Menuki&#39;, Token TaiKai 1976, on pp. 62 & 63 the following is noted:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;      &quot;By the end of the Dolmen Period the Tsuka ornaments had been <br/>\n&gt; modified to function as Mekugi.  Because of the constraints placed on <br/>\n&gt; Menuki, the size was reduced and the design became rounded and more <br/>\n&gt; compact.  These first Menuki were made to be an integral part of the <br/>\n&gt; Mekugi.  The solid pin of one Menuki extended through the Mekugi-Ana <br/>\n&gt; of the sword and was capped on the other side of the Tsuka by the <br/>\n&gt; hollow cylindrical pin of the matching Menuki.  This hollow-solid <br/>\n&gt; cylindrical arrangement remained standard in the Goto School for five <br/>\n&gt; hundred years after the Menuki ceased to be an integral part of the <br/>\n&gt; Mekugi.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;      By the end of the Nara Period the wrapped Tsuka came into common <br/>\n&gt; use.  This inovation sounded the death knell of the integral Mekugi-<br/>\n&gt; Menuki.  Since the tight wrapping allowed virtually no space between <br/>\n&gt; adjacent turns, the Mekugi-Menuki had to be mounted over the Tsuka-<br/>\n&gt; Ito.  The softness of the wrap allowed the pins to move relative to <br/>\n&gt; one another.  The subsequent metal to metal wear, resulted in loss of <br/>\n&gt; adhesion, with the possible disappearance of one Menuki.  An <br/>\n&gt; alternate method of external mounting was attempted.  This consisted <br/>\n&gt; of mounting the two Menuki on an independent wooden Mekugi.  The <br/>\n&gt; mounting was accomplished using a hollow cylindrical pin in each <br/>\n&gt; Menuki, to fit over the Mekugi proper.  This approach was doomed to <br/>\n&gt; failure for the same reasons stated earlier.  The double hollow <br/>\n&gt; cylindrical pin arrangement, remained as a vestige of this mounting <br/>\n&gt; technique, until the Muromachi Period, in the Ezo School.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;      These two attempts at using externally mounted Menuki, either <br/>\n&gt; attached to or made part of the Mekugi, can only be classed as <br/>\n&gt; transitional.  From a functional standpoint they were doomed to <br/>\n&gt; failure from the onset.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;      Even though the Menuki could not be mounted as part of the <br/>\n&gt; mekugi, tradition dictated that the Menuki be retained.
