Besides a few swords and fittings, I&#39;m bringing most of the books I bought several months ago. I never did follow-up on peddling these via Ebay. If you&#39;re looking for any books, stop by and have a look. Books are HEAVY so this is a chance to save shipping/insurance plus...I sure don&#39;t look forward to lugging them back home again! Check out my table. I take (good) checks and of course, cash! Seriously, there are some good titles that I&#39;ll have there. <br/>\n<br/>\nRon<br/>\nSTL<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",

(Raising funds to pay off sword related debts.)<br/>\n<br/>\nWill have my remaining copies of our 2007 KTK Tokyo exhibition catalogue for sale (nothing but compliments by those who have purchased this fine printing). Also have a copy of Nihonto Zuikan Koto-hen, a set of Shinshinto Taikan, Tsuba Taikan (reprint), Hakusui Inami&#39;s Nihonto; The Japanese Sword and a copy of Yumei Koto Taikan. Boy, these are heavy books! I don&#39;t know how the bookdealers can handle these critters show after show! <br/>\n<br/>\nHope to see you there, good Lord willing. <br/>\n<br/>\nRon<br/>\nSTL<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
