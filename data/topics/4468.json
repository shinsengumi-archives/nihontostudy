Thanks to mentors such as Barry Thomas, I spent over <br/>\n10K in my first 3 or 4 years on my library, and I am still tweaking and <br/>\nrefining it, the more I learn, the more I realise, this books out, I <br/>\nneed that book instead. It is ongoing and I see no end to it, that&#39;s <br/>\nfine. I have been told on more than a dozen occasions, you could have <br/>\nbought 100 tsuba for that money, yes I could, but I would have 100 crap <br/>\ntsuba and I would have learnt only that &quot; this is what a crap tsuba <br/>\nlooks like&#39;.

I seem <br/>\nto recall that started an interesting spat of disagreements LOL.<br/>\n<br/>\nI had a private message the other day bagging the latest NTHK shinsa <br/>\nvery heavily, and I came away questioning just how much the author of <br/>\nthat letter really knew. Some of the questions answered themselves, so I <br/>\ndid not know what it was he was asking. I assume that is what Jim is <br/>\nalso asking. What is it they want to know ?.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think there is a real leaning towards collecting for profit and resale <br/>\nand less towards collecting for study.<br/>\n<br/>\nSad, I wish I was around in the good old days.<br/>\n<br/>\nRich<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",

            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1153168203\">Barry,<br/>\n<br/>\nThe judges don&#39;t see who the items belong to, but some years ago when doing the paperwork jobs and moving items from place to place around the room it was very clear that pass rate could vary drastically with customer.  It wasn&#39;t unusual to see a one guy submit a big group of items with 90% passing and the next do the same with 90% failing.  It&#39;s quite a report card for those willing to read it.  Of course I suppose shinsa is still very cheap compared to long-term serious study.<br/>\n<br/>\nJim<br/>\n  I had a good laugh over that.  Some years ago four of us from my part of the world travelled 600 miles to see some collector mates in another State.  It was a great get together and we stayed for 5 days enjoying the hospitality and the viewings.  One of our mates there has had a collection of fittings for many years.  At one stage of the proceedings he cried out &quot;Why isn&#39;t anyone looking at the fittings??!!&quot;  The following words sprang unbidden to my mind &quot;Because they&#39;re all crap mate&quot;.  He did have a couple of nice pieces, but the rest...  When I hear about the &quot;rain of pink slips&quot; at Shinsa I know people aren&#39;t even beginning to try and do their own study and homework, like my mate who prefers to &quot;keep and dream&quot; rather than find out or even advance his knowledge.  I&#39;ve always used Shinsa to back my own judgement.  In the early daze I had blades fail, but I never had a tosogu fail.  The learning curve is steep and long.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Best regards,<br/>\n<br/>\n  Barry Thomas.<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
