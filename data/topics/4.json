Thinner lighter tsuba were used for one handed sword action as the use of the sword was generally mounted ( from the horse ), later on in the The Muromachi, the action moved two the ground and became two handed ( both hands were free ) the sword didn&#39;t need to be as light and the tsuba became heavier to cope with the balance required for two handed use.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is at least how I recall it, I stand corrected and look for guidence if I am off the mark, especially with the periods I quoted, I&#39;m trying this from memory.<br/>\n<br/>\nRich T<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Matthew E.

Doesn&#39;t that<br/>\n  play an important role as well ?<br/>\n<br/>\n  I read in a piece by R. B. Caldwell that since the kamakura tachis were<br/>\n  so well balanced by themselves (he described them as prima donnas haha) <br/>\n<br/>\n  they really only needed a light lacquered leather guard. <br/>\n<br/>\n  So it stands to reason that the Nambokucho massive swords that had<br/>\n  little fumbari were no where near as well balanced and must have needed<br/>\n  massive tsuba to match ??<br/>\n<br/>\n  Or small ones that were 2.5 inches wide and 1 inch thick of course<br/>\n  hahaha<br/>\n<br/>\n  - Matt <br/>\n<br/>\n  -----Oorspronkelijk bericht-----<br/>\n  Van: Richard Turner [mailto:ikkanshi@...] <br/>\n  Verzonden: donderdag 24 april 2003 6:16<br/>\n  Aan: nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com<br/>\n  Onderwerp: Re: [nihontostudy] EXCELLENT!!! and startin&#39; off with a<br/>\n  question...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  This is an interesting topic, I have just been lent The Picture Book of<br/>\n  Old Tsuba by Robert Burawoy to read and enjoy and there are several of<br/>\n  these <br/>\n  very tsuba in this book.

            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-99776648\">If anyone is interested, I can send you a copy of the Excel spreadsheet that<br/>\nRichard mentioned.  While hardly a scientific sample, what I did was to go<br/>\nthrough the Tokyo National Museum Uchigatana Koshirae book and record the<br/>\ntsuba diameter, saya length and tsuka length for each illustrated katana or<br/>\nwakizashi koshirae.  It&#39;s somewhat interesting to play with.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt turns out that correlation between saya length (a proxy for blade length)<br/>\nand tsuba diameter is fairly weak.  The correlation between tsuka length and<br/>\ntsuba size is actually better.  The correlation between saya length and<br/>\ntsuka length is very good.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe average katana tsuba is 8.03 cm in diameter, but the range is 5.85-10.80<br/>\ncm.<br/>\nThe average wakizashi tsuba is 6.59 cm in diameter, with a range of 4.90 to<br/>\n8.60 cm.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, making definite statements about katana-size or wakizashi-sized tsuba on<br/>\nsize alone is pretty difficult.  There are no dates given for most of the<br/>\nkoshirae in the book, so that is not included in the spreadsheet.  There&#39;s<br/>\nmore work to do here.<br/>\n<br/>\nJim<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Jim G. actually created a database from the uchigatana book, but I&#39;m not<br/>\n&gt; sure he put the dates in so I can&#39;t xref to that.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; rkg<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Richard Turner wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;This is an interesting topic, I have just been lent The Picture Book of<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Old Tsuba by Robert Burawoy to read and enjoy and there are several of these<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;very tsuba in this book.
