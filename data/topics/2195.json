Sorry - Papers are a good start, but...<br/>\n<br/>\nI had alluded to Jim&#39;s article about tsuba care - he recommends boiling <br/>\nwater, which works<br/>\npretty well.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn paint, I should have been more clear (that&#39;s what I get for typing <br/>\nlate at night) - often older<br/>\ntsubas were lacquered - remmnants of old paint on a tsuba should be <br/>\nhandled with the greatest<br/>\ncare/respect (on really old tsuba you&#39;ll see the paint form this <br/>\nfunky/cool amalgum with the surface<br/>\npatina) - you have to proceed carefully (or just leave well enough <br/>\nalone) when you have old<br/>\npaint like that - I had a tosho once I nicknamed &quot;rusty crusty&quot; because <br/>\nthere was a fairly thick<br/>\nuncared for patina on it - BUT there was also a fair amount of what <br/>\nappeared to be original<br/>\nlacquer, so I left it well enough alone - while the tsuba would probably <br/>\nhave looked a whole<br/>\nlot better/sold for more if I had just attacked it a little with the <br/>\nivory/rubbing, it didn&#39;t seem<br/>\nright since it would have nuked the lacquer as well...  The real answer <br/>\nis experience...  You need<br/>\nto go and look at and study (and take good pictures of if you&#39;re <br/>\nmotivated) a bunch of good tsuba...<br/>\n<br/>\nOn &quot;primped&quot; tsuba, an amazing number of tsuba in the US appear to have <br/>\ngotten the &quot;treatment&quot; -<br/>\nI&#39;ve pretty much stopped buying pieces from people in the US who I don&#39;t <br/>\nknow because of this -<br/>\nI&#39;ve been burned enough so I can usually recognize its been jacked with, <br/>\nbut I get tired of sending<br/>\npieces back - but you&#39;ll even get stuff from Japan occasionally that has <br/>\nbeen &quot;helped&quot;...  (comments<br/>\nabout how many people don&#39;t seem to understand white balance on digital <br/>\ncameras deleted).<br/>\n<br/>\nGotta run,<br/>\n<br/>\nrkg<br/>\n(Richard George)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Hi Richard,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Thank you for your excellent words of wisdom.

I certainly hear what you&#39;re saying, and want <br/>\n&gt;to heed your words.  But how, exactly, can I know it when I see it?  <br/>\n&gt;I don&#39;t believe any of the pieces I&#39;ve acquired thus far have been <br/>\n&gt;tampered with this way, but I guess I can&#39;t really be sure (I have <br/>\n&gt;not attempted any soap and water cleaning of them.  They <br/>\n&gt;appear in great condition to my untrained eye, and so I haven&#39;t <br/>\n&gt;felt any need to clean...).  Most of my pieces have Hozon papers: <br/>\n&gt;would this be any indication at all that the tsuba in question are <br/>\n&gt;more likely to be &quot;deception-free&quot;?

I think the <br/>\nmessage I&#39;m getting is:  just leave well enough alone!  So I <br/>\nbelieve I will...  :o).  <br/>\nOne thing, though:  for rookies like me, how would you suggest <br/>\nbeing able to spot the oiled, waxed, or (gulp) painted tsuba that <br/>\nmay deceive me?  I certainly hear what you&#39;re saying, and want <br/>\nto heed your words.  But how, exactly, can I know it when I see it?  <br/>\nI don&#39;t believe any of the pieces I&#39;ve acquired thus far have been <br/>\ntampered with this way, but I guess I can&#39;t really be sure (I have <br/>\nnot attempted any soap and water cleaning of them.  They <br/>\nappear in great condition to my untrained eye, and so I haven&#39;t <br/>\nfelt any need to clean...).  Most of my pieces have Hozon papers: <br/>\nwould this be any indication at all that the tsuba in question are <br/>\nmore likely to be &quot;deception-free&quot;?  Or is that entirely irrelevant?  <br/>\nSorry for all the bothersome questions, but I really am eager to <br/>\nbecome informed!
