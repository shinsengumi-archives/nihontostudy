He said that he thinks that he is the originator of the term, however he also said that he doesn&#39;t have any concrete proof to tie these guards to Shoami working in Mito.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI have seen tsuba signed only &quot;Shoami&quot; that appear to be better quality precursors of the so-called Mito Shoami shiiremono style.  Those in turn are similar to some (better yet) Shonai work, and we have already touched on signed and attributed Aizu Shoami work, which Bob also mentioned today.  There seems to be some regional similarity of style, and some association with the Shoami.  However this does not add up to proof of the authorship of these guards or of the existance of a Mito Shoami.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour original point is valid.

While not always to my personal taste,<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; there were a number of Mito lines producing very high quality <br/>\n&gt; fittings. <br/>\n&gt;   &gt; Several of these Mito lineage founders were students of leading kinko<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; artists.  No doubt the Mito Tokugawa branch family (with 350,000 koku<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; revenue) and their retainers were responsible for supporting these many<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; skilled workers.<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; The standardized plates, designs taken from copy books, large scale<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; production and relatively poor quality are characteristics of the Mito<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; Shoami.  Aizu Shoami workers did a lot of the same.<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; There are some rather poor quality, unsigned Mito tsuba as well.  It&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; probably possible to find a group of better than average Mito Shoami<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; work that exceeds the quality of the bottom of Mito production.  These<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; lesser pieces are probably the source of the confusion between Mito and<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; Mito Shoami.  I have seen some fairly insipid mumei tsuba with <br/>\n&gt; kanteisho<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; to Mito.<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; It&#39;s true that better Mito workers did copy Nara, Hamano and others, <br/>\n&gt; but<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; their copy work is nothing like the Mito Shoami stuff after the Nara<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; style.  If anything the workmanship of the Mito copies is a bit over <br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; top compared with the originals.  It&#39;s also usually signed by the maker.<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; There was a book on published 5-10 years ago on Mito swords and <br/>\n&gt; tosogu. <br/>\n&gt;   &gt; Mine is out on loan and I don&#39;t remember the title or author&#39;s name. <br/>\n&gt;   &gt; Does anyone have one handy?  In any event, that&#39;s a good book to look<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; through to get a feel for the better Mito work.<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; Jim<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;   Rich,<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;   I think you are mistaken in your appraisal of Mito work, the Mito <br/>\n&gt; Shoami<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;   never achieved much prominence but the Mito Kinko are among the best<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; artists<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;   who ever made fittings, particularly in the late Edo/Meiji periods <br/>\n&gt; with<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;   artists like Hagiya Katsuhei and Unno Shomin. They were also very able<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;   copyists, I remember Mr Ono some years ago showed me a well known <br/>\n&gt; Somin<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;   kozuka of a horse (seen from the rear) in takazogan, I asked him how<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; to tell<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;   the real thing from a Mito copy, he said the only difference was that<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; in the<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;   copy the horse stood more proud, or was it the other way around?<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;   Alan<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;         Yahoo!

            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1556261358\">Cary,<br/>\nInteresting question... my initial thoughts without any effort at research:<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that I picked up the Mito Shoami designation from Bob Haynes years ago.  The term does appear in his auction catalogs, although that is not sufficient grounds for proving the existence of the group.  Calling something &quot;nameless shiiremono&quot; would of course not advance a sale.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Tetsu no Isho - Mito-To to Tosogu no Meihin&quot; is indeed the book I was thinking of.  Of course we wouldn&#39;t expect to see the low quality examples from any group or region illustrated or referenced.  So the absence of mention is not necessarily proof of non-existence.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t believe that I have ever seen a kanteisho to Mito Shoami.  However, when I assisted Hagihara-sensei at last year&#39;s shinsa in Jersey City, the so-called &quot;Mito Shoami&quot; type examples submitted were all rejected as &quot;poor quality work,&quot; so there was no opportunity for such an attribution to be made on an NTHK kanteisho.  If that is the standard judgment of the NBTHK, we would not expect to see any Mito Shoami kanteisho at all, even if the group existed.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do not recall seeing any examples signed Mito Shoami.  I have seen examples signed Aizu ju Shoami and I have seen many mumei pieces, although of better quality than the &quot;Mito Shoami&quot; examples, attributed to Aizu Shoami.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI assume you can picture the type of tsuba that we have been calling Mito Shoami.  There are many of them in the US and the type is quite uniform.  Who do you think made all of those tsuba?  Serious question.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe merit of the usage of the term Mito Shoami deserves follow up.  I think that we&#39;ll find that these guards are indeed ignored as shiiremono and are not likely to be documented or recognized by Japanese sources.  Again, interesting observation.<br/>\n<br/>\nJim<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Jim, Alan, Rich et al.<br/>\n<br/>\n  My remarks may be radical and heretical considering<br/>\n  how casually the term &quot;Mito Shoami&quot; is bandied about<br/>\n  on this list and others.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I have never seen a tsuba or other kodogu attributed<br/>\n  to Mito Shoami. I am of the opinion that Shoami<br/>\n  artisans were not productive there.<br/>\n<br/>\n  There are certainly pieces that have papered to just Mito.<br/>\n  But none that I know of to Mito Shoami,<br/>\n  in which case the basic premise is incorrect.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Jim,<br/>\n  The book you are referring to I presume is titled:<br/>\n  Tetsu no Isho - Mito-To to Tosogu no Meihin (1996).<br/>\n  Ibaraki Prefectural Historical Museum.<br/>\n<br/>\n  In section II - Mito Kinko no Tosogu,<br/>\n  The introductory text records prominent individuals<br/>\n  and groups that were active in Mito (Hitachi province).<br/>\n  Among them:<br/>\n  Gunji Yogoro<br/>\n  Yatabe Tsuji<br/>\n  Seiryuken Ha<br/>\n  Ichiryu (Hitotsuyanagi) Ha<br/>\n  Tamagawa Ha<br/>\n  Uchikoshi Ha<br/>\n  Yasuchika Ha (from the 4th gen. Yasuchika)<br/>\n  Saotome and Myochin.<br/>\n  And of course, Hagiya Shohei (Katsuhira) and Unno Shomin.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  NO mention of Shoami in Mito.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Checking Haynes- Tsuba, An Aesthetic Study.<br/>\n  Under the section dealing with SHOAMI he mentions:<br/>\n  Kyo Shoami, Awa Shoami, Bizen Shoami, Iyo Shoami,<br/>\n  Aizu Shoami, Shonai Shoami, Akita Shoami,<br/>\n  Bushu (Edo) Shoami & Sakushu (Mimasaka) Shoami.<br/>\n  In addition he adds individuals who signed:<br/>\n  Oshu Shoami, Soshu (Odawara) Shoami, Seishu (Ise) Shoami,<br/>\n  Osaka (Settsu) Shoami, Banshu (Harima) Shoami,<br/>\n  Inshu (Inaba) Shoami & Kurume (Chikugo) Shoami.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Again NO mention of Mito Shoami.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I have never liked the term Mito Shoami<br/>\n  and have never used it. This thread presented<br/>\n  an opportunity to research the issue<br/>\n  to see if my opinion had any basis.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Can anyone document a piece that has been<br/>\n  authoritatively classified as Mito Shoami<br/>\n  or have we been perpetuating a fallacy?<br/>\n<br/>\n  Cary Condell<br/>\n<br/>\n  Condell & Co., Ltd.<br/>\n  P.O.

While not always to my personal taste, <br/>\n  &gt; there were a number of Mito lines producing very high quality fittings.  <br/>\n  &gt; Several of these Mito lineage founders were students of leading kinko <br/>\n  &gt; artists.  No doubt the Mito Tokugawa branch family (with 350,000 koku <br/>\n  &gt; revenue) and their retainers were responsible for supporting these many <br/>\n  &gt; skilled workers.<br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt; The standardized plates, designs taken from copy books, large scale <br/>\n  &gt; production and relatively poor quality are characteristics of the Mito <br/>\n  &gt; Shoami.  Aizu Shoami workers did a lot of the same.<br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt; There are some rather poor quality, unsigned Mito tsuba as well.  It&#39;s <br/>\n  &gt; probably possible to find a group of better than average Mito Shoami <br/>\n  &gt; work that exceeds the quality of the bottom of Mito production.  These <br/>\n  &gt; lesser pieces are probably the source of the confusion between Mito and <br/>\n  &gt; Mito Shoami.  I have seen some fairly insipid mumei tsuba with kanteisho <br/>\n  &gt; to Mito.<br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt; It&#39;s true that better Mito workers did copy Nara, Hamano and others, but <br/>\n  &gt; their copy work is nothing like the Mito Shoami stuff after the Nara <br/>\n  &gt; style.  If anything the workmanship of the Mito copies is a bit over the <br/>\n  &gt; top compared with the originals.  It&#39;s also usually signed by the maker.<br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt; There was a book on published 5-10 years ago on Mito swords and tosogu.  <br/>\n  &gt; Mine is out on loan and I don&#39;t remember the title or author&#39;s name.  <br/>\n  &gt; Does anyone have one handy?  In any event, that&#39;s a good book to look <br/>\n  &gt; through to get a feel for the better Mito work.<br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt; Jim<br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt;   Rich,<br/>\n  &gt;   I think you are mistaken in your appraisal of Mito work, the Mito Shoami<br/>\n  &gt;   never achieved much prominence but the Mito Kinko are among the best <br/>\n  &gt; artists<br/>\n  &gt;   who ever made fittings, particularly in the late Edo/Meiji periods with<br/>\n  &gt;   artists like Hagiya Katsuhei and Unno Shomin. They were also very able<br/>\n  &gt;   copyists, I remember Mr Ono some years ago showed me a well known Somin<br/>\n  &gt;   kozuka of a horse (seen from the rear) in takazogan, I asked him how <br/>\n  &gt; to tell<br/>\n  &gt;   the real thing from a Mito copy, he said the only difference was that <br/>\n  &gt; in the<br/>\n  &gt;   copy the horse stood more proud, or was it the other way around?<br/>\n  &gt;   Alan<br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt;&gt; <br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>        Yahoo!
