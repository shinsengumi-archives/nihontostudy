I&#39;ve never seen one like it <br/>\nbefore. It&#39;s saya is made of bamboo.  The tsuba is gold or brass with <br/>\nwhat look like narcissus flowers and pods.  The blade is forged but <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t appear to be high-quality steel (hamon is midare).  The <br/>\nkojiri of the saya is flared.  The kissaki is O and the mune is <br/>\nihori. The boshi is midare-komi on one side and almost Jizo on the <br/>\nother.  Nakago appears to be tanago.
