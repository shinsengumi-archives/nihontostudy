            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-766001800\">Thank you Dr. Lissenden for your article.<br/>\nThe inscriptions shown on oblong shape tsuba read &quot;To-yo(Oriental) <br/>\nMartial Sword&quot; in English. (I guess it strongly suggested that the <br/>\niron pieces are tsubas and not anything else.)<br/>\nThe way To-yo combined into new Kanji phrase is unique to Japan. It <br/>\nindicats that the tsuba could be dated as early as when emperor <br/>\nMeiji came to power or even earlier as I would explain later. <br/>\nWestern metal processing technique was then not yet introduced into <br/>\nJapan. This probably explains why the quality of workmanship appears <br/>\nto be out dated. <br/>\nMeteorite of all kind have their own earth age respectively <br/>\nmeasurable counting from the day they reached the globe. <br/>\nI hope someday some scientists would be interested enough in doing <br/>\nthe dating for this tsuba.<br/>\nOnce determined of its age people could better tell its background <br/>\nby linking its age with history of Sino-Japanese cultural enchange. <br/>\nTsuba or any other name one might have it called I am sure it must <br/>\nhave been a part of one very unusual martial sword exactly as the <br/>\ninscription illustrated. <br/>\nThe owner of which could be rather important so qualifiable to claim <br/>\nthe ownership of the rare iron meteorite. Who is this man? I wonder. <br/>\nBy inscripting tsuba with &quot;TO-YO(oriental) MARTIAL SWORD&quot; The sword <br/>\nmust have been made with an western reciepient in mind. Again an <br/>\nimportant figure. Who is this western man?<br/>\nHere comes one interesting question. Why the Japanese craftman did <br/>\nnot inscribe the said tsuba straight forwardly with &quot;Japanese <br/>\nmartial sword&quot;?<br/>\nPlease note that during Chinese Ming dynasty, which is earlier than <br/>\nMeiji period, Japan shipped a lot of porcelain art to Europe bearing <br/>\nmostly Chinese designs. And remarkable portioned of them marked with <br/>\nChinese way of dating. <br/>\n(This was happened when China sealed its seaport to contain its own <br/>\npeople within.) <br/>\nJapanese porcelain exporters were aiming to impress European buyers <br/>\nthat the porcelain they shipped were of China origin. For in <br/>\nEuropean&#39;s mind then whatever oriental was mysteriously Chinese. <br/>\nSomewhere in Japan long ago there might have been a recorded <br/>\nmeteoric fall. An iron meteor broke into many pieces before falling. <br/>\nThere in the local museum some specimen could still be found. What <br/>\nif this tsuba happens to contain exactly same content as the <br/>\nexsisting ones? <br/>\nShould that be the case I would be happy to laon my tsuba to that <br/>\nJapanese museum for the sake of happy reunion -- after many <br/>\ncenturies of roaming.<br/>\n<br/>\nChen, Yingchaw<br/>\nTaipei<br/>\nPhoto File titled SOSIDORE<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com\">nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Dr John P Lissenden&quot; <br/>\n&lt;docliss@j...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; While I cannot add any knowledge to &quot;sosidore&quot;&#39;s on the subject of <br/>\n&gt; meteoric iron, I cannot let his comments pass without making some <br/>\n </span></blockquote>of <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; my own.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The two artefacts that he illustrates, with their square <br/>\n </span></blockquote>apertures,  <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; demonstrate a common enigma in deciding what use they were <br/>\n </span></blockquote>intended <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; for.
