            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-598614281\">I know that there are some knowledgeable tsuba collectors on this list, and I <br/>\nwould like your opinions and thoughts good, bad or indifferent.  I recently <br/>\npurchased this tsuba on eBay.<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry I don&#39;t have better pictures.  I don&#39;t have a digital camera.  These <br/>\nare the pictures I grabbed off eBay before they disappeared.  The pictures are <br/>\nin my folder &quot;Lou&#39;s Stuff.&quot;  The piece looks better in person.<br/>\n<br/>\nI like many collectors am still learning.  I was wondering if anyone out <br/>\nthere is knowledgeable enough to attribute this piece to one of the smiths of the <br/>\nAkasaka school.  It is extremely thick.  Somewhere between 9 and 9.5 mm.  I <br/>\ndon&#39;t have any calipers at home so that is the best I can do.  It is 81 X 79 mm <br/>\nin diameter.  This extreme thickness seems quite strange.  None of the Akasaka <br/>\ntsuba in Sassano&#39;s book or Kremers&#39; book are this thick.  From my limited <br/>\nknowledge I thought that earlier Akasaka pieces are very open like this one and <br/>\nare influenced by the Owari style.  I&#39;m not sure if I would say that the theme <br/>\nis Owari in style but I would say that the thickness is.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks to all who contribute their thoughts to this thread.<br/>\n<br/>\nLou<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
