So let me just say that the <br/>\nSecond Amendment isn&#39;t about duck or deer hunting, it&#39;s about killing <br/>\npeople with firearms, particulary people within the government, <br/>\nshould such government turn on the people it is supposed to <br/>\nrepresent.  As such, the protection for a handgun (a defensive, last <br/>\nditch weapon in a major armed conflict) is somewhat weak, but a fully <br/>\nautomatic long arm is just what the Founding Fathers had in mind, <br/>\ngiven modern technological advancements.  This doesn&#39;t mean that <br/>\nprivate citizens should be permitted WMDs, but a full &quot;rock &#39;n&#39; roll&quot; <br/>\nrifle should be every citizen&#39;s right.  Unfortunately, besides <br/>\nkilling renegade politicians, it is pretty lethal in the hands of <br/>\npsychopaths.  And in order to preclude this, liberals believe it is <br/>\ncorrect to forego the Second Amendment, and give up the right to <br/>\nresist an oppressive government, thinking that the kind, just and <br/>\nbenevolent government elected by the people could never turn <br/>\nvirulent.  This, of course, ignores world history and basic human <br/>\nnature.  Anywho, Australia is indeed the road map for the rest of the <br/>\nliberal left world.  The &quot;safety line&quot; you speak of is never far <br/>\nenough along for those who desire complete safety (and in the <br/>\nsuccessful pursuit of this, finally lose the safety of the whole <br/>\nsociety).  In an armed society, government exercises control at the <br/>\nwill of the people.  In an unarmed society, people exercise freedom <br/>\nat the will of the government.  Not oversimplified, just is.<br/>\n<br/>\nNC</div>",

            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1387619114\">Just to clarify: in the US, bans against assault weapons typically have targeted ugly, military style long arms which do not actually meet the real definition of an assault weapon.  An assault weapon [translation of the German: sturmgewehr] is really, definitionally speaking, a long arm, firing a cartridge intermediate in power between conventional pistol and rifle cartridges, capable of both full and semi-automatic fire.  Arms included in US &quot;assault weapon&quot; bans usually, but not necessarily, resemble the exterior of assault weapons, but, since fully automatic weapons have been federally restricted since the 1930s, are merely semi-automatics.  Some shotguns, guilty of military appearance, have been included in such bans.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know positively, but I think the NRA has filed amicus briefs on some knife cases.  Were litigation on Nihonto underway, I think it would be highly likely that the NRA, and other gun rights organizations, would be willing to assist.<br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally, I think the case of Australia illustrates very clearly what will happen to weapons collectors who are sufficiently in the minority, and who fail to organize in time.  Bans of private weapons are feel-good symbolic measures giving politicians the opportunity to be seen taking action.  In the modern world, a serious and potent animosity toward private ownership of weapons exists on the part of a substantial and highly influential portion of the urban population.  This animosity is linked to the spirit of reformist ameliorism, the very popular belief that a specific solution by governmental diktat exists to any identifiable problem or ill.  Its roots lie in centuries old ideologies of religious utopianism, which literally desire all the swords to be beaten into plowshares.  And this philosophy is very popular on the political left, which yearns to increase the powers of the state, particularly the state&#39;s monopoly of force.  The affluent and educated sectors of American society typically live in congested urban environments.  They do not hunt or target-shoot.  They are estranged from the tradition of military service and the use of arms.  And they look with contempt on less educated, rural sectors of American society in which hunting, ownership of arms, and military service are highly valued traditions.  The wealthy bourgeois living in a million dollar house in Palo Alto thinks it is simply criminally irresponsible to allow a bunch of rubes and other denizens of American society&#39;s lower orders to play with dangerous weapons.

            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1950787006\">I don&#39;t think Nihonto is particularly on the NRA&#39;s radar specifically.  But it is the same issue fundamentally, the private possession of arms, whether the particular arms under consideration consist of the Pennsylvania farmer&#39;s hunting rifle, or the SF Bay area tech mogul&#39;s Ichimonji daito.  My point was that the most effective lobbying organization on the basic issue is the National Rifle Association, whose membership typically runs between three and four million, and whose membership is well know to turn out and vote.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf the NRA loses the fight over so-called assault weapons, then they will come after handguns.  If we lose on handguns, then they will go after rifles and shotguns.  And when all the firearms are on the prohibited list, as in Australia, swords, including Nihonto, will be added.   Those who collect antique arms would be well advised to participate in the fight now while they still have a large enough general constituency of hunters, target shooters, and ordinary firearms owners on the same side to constitute a constituency capable of making an electoral impact, and really influencing the politics of the situation.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t imagine that the NRA&#39;s organizational leadership is very conscious of the Nihonto collecting community at the present time, but I&#39;m sure the NRA philosophically regards the right to own and collect Nihonto as part of the same general right to keep and bear arms it devotes most of its energy and resources toward defending.  If American Nihonto organizations were inclined to work with the NRA on Second Amendment issues, I&#39;m sure that the NRA would welcome their assistance.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know the inside story, but I seem to recall that the NRA was involved in publishing Man at Arms, the general arms collecting magazine, recently for some period of time, presumably to keep that journal afloat.  A feature on Japanese swords might not fit in terribly well in the American Rifleman, but would certainly be entirely appropriate to Man at Arms.  <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ghougham@...\">ghougham@...</a> <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:token_kenkyu_kai@...\">token_kenkyu_kai@...</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Tuesday, September 02, 2003 10:32 AM<br/>\n  Subject: RE: [nihontostudy] FW: Regulatory Impact Statement on proposed Regulations (Ozzland sword ban!)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  David, you might be right, but is there any evidence that nihonto is on NRA&#39;s radar? Have they produced any white papers on nihonto control? Do they have a nihonto committee? Will a search on their website hit anything related to nihonto or even swords in general? [Answer to the last question: one mention by Charleston Heston about how guns are only symbolic of our freedoms... etc.. just like swords were a thousand years ago. That&#39;s it. One word in one line in one speech.]<br/>\n<br/>\n  And if nihonto control will be nothing more than a regulatory afterthought, isn&#39;t it equally likely that nihonto will ESCAPE regulatory notice altogether?  I&#39;m not convinced yet that the NRA cares one BIT about swords. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Gavin Hougham<br/>\n<br/>\n  ------------------------------------------------- <br/>\n  Gavin W.

If and when private ownership of most firearms is prohibited, it will only be a short time (as the case of Australia demonstrates) before the same policies are extended to other collectable weapons, including Nihonto.  <br/>\n<br/>\n    Obviously, complete political mobilization of every single Nihonto collector in the United States would produce no effective result.  That constituency is far too small to have any significant influence.  The real battle will be fought and decided over gun control.  Japanese swords will  be only a small regulatory afterthought. Nihonto collectors need to reflect, and realize that the NRA is even now fighting their fight too.  Every Japanese sword owner should join and support the NRA, and I would suggest that the sword dealing community give serious thought to subscribing to that 1% to the NRA program.<br/>\n<br/>\n    www.nra.org<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    David Zincavage<br/>\n    Life Member, NRA <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n      From: Gordon Robson <br/>\n      To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com\">nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n      Sent: Monday, September 01, 2003 4:24 PM<br/>\n      Subject: Re: [nihontostudy] FW: Regulatory Impact Statement on proposed Regulations (Ozzland sword ban!)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      I should get one too.

If and when private ownership of most firearms is prohibited, it will only be a short time (as the case of Australia demonstrates) before the same policies are extended to other collectable weapons, including Nihonto.  <br/>\n<br/>\nObviously, complete political mobilization of every single Nihonto collector in the United States would produce no effective result.  That constituency is far too small to have any significant influence.  The real battle will be fought and decided over gun control.  Japanese swords will  be only a small regulatory afterthought. Nihonto collectors need to reflect, and realize that the NRA is even now fighting their fight too.  Every Japanese sword owner should join and support the NRA, and I would suggest that the sword dealing community give serious thought to subscribing to that 1% to the NRA program.<br/>\n<br/>\nwww.nra.org<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDavid Zincavage<br/>\nLife Member, NRA <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Gordon Robson <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com\">nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Monday, September 01, 2003 4:24 PM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [nihontostudy] FW: Regulatory Impact Statement on proposed Regulations (Ozzland sword ban!)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  I should get one too.

The lawful use and possession of a &quot;prohibited<br/>\n  weapon&quot; requires an Approval from the Chief Commissioner of Police (for<br/>\n  which a fee is charged). Persons may be exempted from this requirement<br/>\n  by the Governor-in-Council. A person, therefore, under the proposed<br/>\n  Regulations, could still lawfully own and possess a sword if, for<br/>\n  example, they obtained an Approval to do so from the Chief Commissioner<br/>\n  of Police.<br/>\n<br/>\n  The proposed Regulations will not necessitate destruction of swords. In<br/>\n  the event that the proposed Regulations come into operation, persons in<br/>\n  possession of a sword who do not obtain an Approval from the Chief<br/>\n  Commissioner of Police and who do not fall under an exemption granted by<br/>\n  the Governor-in-Council could dispose of their weapons through, for<br/>\n  example, an authorised weapons trader.<br/>\n<br/>\n  The Regulatory Impact Statement (RIS) which assesses the impact of the<br/>\n  proposed Regulations has been publicly released and I attach a copy of<br/>\n  the RIS for your information. Should you wish to make a further<br/>\n  submission on the proposed Regulations after reading the RIS (the<br/>\n  proposed Regulations themselves are at Attachment 1 to the RIS) you<br/>\n  would be most welcome to do so. The closing date for submissions is<br/>\n  Monday 8 September 2003. Details on how to make a submission can be<br/>\n  found in the RIS.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Further copies of the Regulatory Impact Statement can be accessed on the<br/>\n  internet at www.justice.vic.gov.au<br/>\n<br/>\n  Thank you for raising your views with the Department of Justice.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Yours sincerely<br/>\n<br/>\n  Signed<br/>\n<br/>\n  Marisa De Cicco<br/>\n  Director, Justice Policy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  (See attached file: Control of Weapons - Firearms Regulatory Impact<br/>\n  Statement.pdf)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  _________________________________________<br/>\n  ***CONFIDENTIAL***<br/>\n  The information in this message and in any attachments may be<br/>\n  confidential.
