I don&#39;t know much about jade, but your example looks much better than those.  The Metropolitan Museum of art in NY has a somewhat similar Chinese sword on display with a polished, undecorated (but very colorful) agate guard.  Some of the early Chinese swords found in Japan have similarly shaped metal guards, although without carved decoration.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI have one of these metal guards that a friend gave me years ago.
