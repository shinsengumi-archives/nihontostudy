The <br/>\nplate is the very best deep black shakudo. The mochi cake is heavy <br/>\nsheet silver uttori over the shakudo.  The wiskers and eyes of the <br/>\nrats are gold uttori.  The hair of the rats is very well defined, <br/>\nthough worn down.  The mochi cake has many of the secret main line <br/>\nGoto marks.  This pair would be about the time of Tokujo or Yeijo, <br/>\nthe fifth and sixth mainline Goto masters (ca.1575-1600 ).  I have <br/>\nseen another pair of menuki almost identical with this pair ( and <br/>\nincluding the matching kogai ) with the original Goto papers stating <br/>\nthem to be the work of Tokujo.  This pair is every bit as fine. Juyo <br/>\nmaterial. Ca.1600  &quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nNothing is for sure till they are submitted for shinsa, at least it <br/>\nlooks &quot; encouraging &quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n-M</div>",
