            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1436674337\">Hi All -<br/>\n<br/>\nA recent purchase has me very interested in finding out the names of subjects on a Hizen tsuba that I&#39;ve shown under Yahoo Photos in my file Ron STL. After digging through my books I&#39;ve come up with more questions than answers. <br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://tinyurl.com/3gv6d3\">http://tinyurl.com/3gv6d3</a><br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m particularly interested in what looks like an &quot;angel&quot; on the front side. I also see a &quot;jewel/tama&quot; in upper-right corner and the peacock and &quot;table.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nThe backside shows a &quot;stone lantern&quot; and the &quot;dragon.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nOn the edge of the tsuba are gold nunome vines and &quot;clouds&quot; (ura side) and on the frontside, more &quot;clouds&quot; and what I believe are a form of &quot;dragon&quot;...perhaps the &quot;water dragon.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve located a similar signed tsuba illustrated in Fukunaga&#39;s &quot;Hizen no Katana to Tsuba&quot; vol. 2, p.317. Unfortunately, I can&#39;t read the detail about this illustration other than it confirms (to my satisfaction) that this is a Hizen tsuba. <br/>\n<br/>\nRegarding the design used on the tsuba&#39;s edge (omote side), the book &quot;Tsuba&quot; by H.U.B. Verlag (?) that Haynes was involved in a number of years ago show a similar edge decoration, but there it is called simply &quot;tendrils.&quot; I think this is wrong, that is is a form of dragon. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyone out there familiar enough with these designs to shed some light on their names/meanings? I find this a rather fascinating tsuba and the &quot;namban&quot; influence it has. <br/>\n<br/>\nRon<br/>\nSTL<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
