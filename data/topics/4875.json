Since the word &#39;namban&#39;, as adopted by the Japanese during <br/>\nthe Heian period, was applied to all foreigners, irrespective of <br/>\ntheir origin, the term &#39;namban iron&#39; should surely be applied to all <br/>\niron not having its origin in the smelting of native ore.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe importation of such iron into Japan from Korea is described in <br/>\nwritings of the early part of the third century AD, local production <br/>\noccurring only a few centuries later than this.  Namban iron thus <br/>\nexisted in Japan many centuries before the Dutch arrival there.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf, however, you consider - in my opinion, quite wrongly - that the <br/>\nterm &#39;namban iron&#39; refers to that of a European source, the Dutch <br/>\nstarted to import iron, with its origins in China, Korea and India, <br/>\nin the early C17.

Bronze cannon were so much easier to <br/>\n&gt;   &gt; produce and less likely to fail than iron. The only difference <br/>\nof <br/>\n&gt;   &gt; import at this time is bronze was more expensive to use. So, I <br/>\nwent <br/>\n&gt;   &gt; to a forum where there are some dedicated historians. I paste <br/>\nthe <br/>\n&gt;   &gt; answers below.<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; <br/>\n&gt;   &gt; <br/>\n&gt;   &gt; Anyway, this might answer your question. The book &#39;The Dutch <br/>\n&gt;   &gt; Discovery Of Japan&#39; by Dirk Jan Barreveld (which is full of <br/>\nerrors, <br/>\n&gt;   &gt; but still helpful in gaining an understanding of Dutch trade) <br/>\n&gt;   states <br/>\n&gt;   &gt; that a report filed by a Jesuit sent to inspect the ship says <br/>\nthat <br/>\n&gt;   &gt; the ship had &#39;19 pieces of guns made of bronze&#39; (other sources <br/>\ngive <br/>\n&gt;   &gt; the number as 18 or 26). <br/>\n&gt;   &gt; From Turnbull&#39;s Osaka book-Ieyasu had 10 European cannon at the <br/>\n&gt;   &gt; battles of Osaka in 1614-15. 5 were Dutch made &#39;Ishibaya&#39; <br/>\ncannons <br/>\n&gt;   &gt; (which fired shot ranging from 12 lbs to 35-40 lbs-it&#39;s unclear <br/>\n&gt;   which <br/>\n&gt;   &gt; type Ieyasu had, though). These were likely from the cannon <br/>\ntaken <br/>\n&gt;   &gt; from DeLiefde. The other 5 were bought from the English East <br/>\nIndia <br/>\n&gt;   &gt; Company and were invoiced by Richard Cocks on December 5, 1614. <br/>\n&gt;   They <br/>\n&gt;   &gt; included 4 culverins (17.5 lbs) and one saker (5.5 lbs). Out of <br/>\n&gt;   about <br/>\n&gt;   &gt; 300 artillery pieces Ieyasu fielded at Osaka, these were the <br/>\nonly <br/>\n&gt;   &gt; heavy siege guns apart from one Japanese gun. This was <br/>\n&gt;   &gt; the &#39;Shinbatsuji&#39; gun, which was made by Shibatsuji Ryuemon <br/>\n&gt;   Sukenobu. <br/>\n&gt;   &gt; It was about 11 feet long with a 90 mm bore, and fired shot <br/>\nabout <br/>\n&gt;   the <br/>\n&gt;   &gt; same size as small Dutch cannon. Unfortunately, it&#39;s not noted <br/>\nwhat <br/>\n&gt;   &gt; they&#39;re made of-the picture of the Japanese gun (which is at <br/>\n&gt;   &gt; Yasukuni) looks like it was bronze. My Japanese books would <br/>\nlikely <br/>\n&gt;   &gt; have this info, but they&#39;re not here .<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; <br/>\n&gt;   &gt; AND<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; <br/>\n&gt;   &gt; Samurai William, p.91, states that the Liefde&#39;s cannon were <br/>\nbronze<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; <br/>\n&gt;   &gt; I still await more information on possible early sources for <br/>\n&gt;   &gt; nambantetsu. I will let you know. It seems so far that article <br/>\nhas <br/>\n&gt;   a <br/>\n&gt;   &gt; lot of supposition.

            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-655474173\">Hi Dr. Lissenden, John, I believe you are right on about the cannon <br/>\nbeing unlikely to be iron. Bronze cannon were so much easier to <br/>\nproduce and less likely to fail than iron. The only difference of <br/>\nimport at this time is bronze was more expensive to use. So, I went <br/>\nto a forum where there are some dedicated historians. I paste the <br/>\nanswers below.<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, this might answer your question. The book &#39;The Dutch <br/>\nDiscovery Of Japan&#39; by Dirk Jan Barreveld (which is full of errors, <br/>\nbut still helpful in gaining an understanding of Dutch trade) states <br/>\nthat a report filed by a Jesuit sent to inspect the ship says that <br/>\nthe ship had &#39;19 pieces of guns made of bronze&#39; (other sources give <br/>\nthe number as 18 or 26). <br/>\nFrom Turnbull&#39;s Osaka book-Ieyasu had 10 European cannon at the <br/>\nbattles of Osaka in 1614-15. 5 were Dutch made &#39;Ishibaya&#39; cannons <br/>\n(which fired shot ranging from 12 lbs to 35-40 lbs-it&#39;s unclear which <br/>\ntype Ieyasu had, though). These were likely from the cannon taken <br/>\nfrom DeLiefde. The other 5 were bought from the English East India <br/>\nCompany and were invoiced by Richard Cocks on December 5, 1614. They <br/>\nincluded 4 culverins (17.5 lbs) and one saker (5.5 lbs). Out of about <br/>\n300 artillery pieces Ieyasu fielded at Osaka, these were the only <br/>\nheavy siege guns apart from one Japanese gun. This was <br/>\nthe &#39;Shinbatsuji&#39; gun, which was made by Shibatsuji Ryuemon Sukenobu. <br/>\nIt was about 11 feet long with a 90 mm bore, and fired shot about the <br/>\nsame size as small Dutch cannon. Unfortunately, it&#39;s not noted what <br/>\nthey&#39;re made of-the picture of the Japanese gun (which is at <br/>\nYasukuni) looks like it was bronze. My Japanese books would likely <br/>\nhave this info, but they&#39;re not here .<br/>\n<br/>\nAND<br/>\n<br/>\nSamurai William, p.91, states that the Liefde&#39;s cannon were bronze<br/>\n<br/>\nI still await more information on possible early sources for <br/>\nnambantetsu. I will let you know. It seems so far that article has a <br/>\nlot of supposition.
