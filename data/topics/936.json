His approach is probably closest to Sasano&#39;s.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust an anecdote that comes to mind...  an experience Bob has mentioned a couple of times was a visit with Dr. Torigoye to a shrine in an area of Japan with a lot of old mound (Kofun) burials.  In addition to the swords that had been donated, the shrine had a box of Kofun jidai fittings that had turned up over the years.  Included among these was a kogai that was presumably contemporary with this material.  This was at a time when kogai were considered to be a late invention.  Today there are kogai that are accepted as Heian to Kamakura period.  Dating of early fittings still needs a lot of work.<br/>\nJim<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Hey guys,<br/>\n<br/>\n  I just got a chance to peruse the set of Haynes catalogs I ordered from <br/>\n  Mr. Helm (thanks again Tom!).<br/>\n<br/>\n  There appears to be a lot of good info in them.  One thing I was curious <br/>\n  about was the dating in them - at<br/>\n  first glance it looks like perhaps Mr. Haynes was trying to follow <br/>\n  Sasano&#39;s &quot;telescoped&quot; dating for fittings.<br/>\n  Is this really what&#39;s going on, or are there really that many kamakura <br/>\n  era tsuba, kogai, menuki, etc, out there...<br/>\n  (I think Jim had implied earlier that Sasano&#39;s students are busily <br/>\n  standing back from his dating scale now,<br/>\n  and...)<br/>\n<br/>\n  Thanks,<br/>\n<br/>\n  rkg<br/>\n  (Richard George)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
