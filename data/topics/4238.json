            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1705678136\">Hi all,<br/>\nHaving the book and seeing all the text with diagrams<br/>\npointing to marks on a menuki, makes me almost crazy<br/>\nin not being able to read what they are saying.  Of<br/>\ncourse, not crazy enough to actually learn japanese<br/>\nlike some you do.  <br/>\n<br/>\nFYI for those that want to know about the book some<br/>\nmore, the first section is all pics of the 17<br/>\ngenerations work.  then it gets into text what I<br/>\nassume is detailing a bit about each generation and<br/>\nhow you can tell it was them. Has diagrams and you can<br/>\ntell some things like one generation used a rounded<br/>\nedge etc,.  I would push for a translation more if I<br/>\nreally was collecting Goto work.  But since I don&#39;t<br/>\ncollect in that range usually ($$$$$$), there are so<br/>\nmany other books I want info on.  Of course I did<br/>\nacquire 1 nice Goto mantis piece recently (most likely<br/>\nKaga Goto). Haven&#39;t seen a Mantis Goto menuki yet. <br/>\nSome beautiful work though, amazing detail.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThen of course there are all the side groups who<br/>\nworked in similiar style and at times did more<br/>\ninteresting work as the Goto school was very rigid in<br/>\nwhat they did (ok I read that in one of those books<br/>\nout there).  Does anyone know of any articles on Kaga<br/>\ngoto?  I know there is the Kaga takain, but at around<br/>\n$700- 800, I&#39;m not in the market for it.
