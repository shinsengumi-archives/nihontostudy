At 84 cms in width it is unusually large for the group - only <br/>\nsome 3 per cent measure that or more, and the largest one I have seen <br/>\nwas 93 cms.  It is also unusual in that it has two contemporaneous <br/>\nryo-hitsu, and that these are both hangetsu-gata.  Does the smaller <br/>\none have sekigane?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe iron appears to be good, although the extensive carving on these <br/>\ntsubas meant that the iron was never of very good quality.  The <br/>\ncarving of the undercut karakusa and the surface chisel-work are <br/>\nsharp and excellent.  The plain, squared rim; the absence of OTT gold <br/>\noverlay; the conventionally shaped seppa-dai and ryo-hitsu; and the <br/>\nasymmetrical design all combine to  impart a dignity that is seldom <br/>\nassociated with tsuba of this group.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is a beautiful tsuba, and well-deserving of its tokubetsu hozon <br/>\nstatus.  I am hesitant to give a firm time period.  On the one hand, <br/>\nbecause of the introduction of better metal-working tools, those <br/>\nNamban tsuba of a later period are generally the more skillfully <br/>\nmade.  Conversely, those with conventional seppa-dai were often <br/>\nearlier.  I imagine that the kanteisho says &#39;Edo period&#39;?
