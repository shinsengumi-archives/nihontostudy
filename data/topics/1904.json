            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2063771146\">Hi Rob and John.<br/>\nThankyou for your kind words. It is very unplesant to admit that you have been cheeted like this. In these kind of matters, i.e. internercriminality, the police work very slowly. The case has just reached the USA Police. Too late to interfere and investigate the current episode on ebay where the auction were planned to close on th 19th. of May. I actually bought the sword and payed 3980 US dollars for it, but never received it. Therefore it belongs to me unless someone has bought it before I did.  Normally I am very carefully to get enough documentation for peobles identity before trading. Assumenly passport, driverslicense and NBTHK papers as well as a lot of photos were not enough. Furthermore I don´t know whether someone else might have bought this beatyful sword before the date I bought it? Naturally I would prefer to get the sword but have realized that it might be very difficult and that matters the money as well. But the sword are unique, as all japanese swords are. In addition it has NBTHK paers and in my opinion it should not be impossible to find a former or maybe the current owner, if it is not me. Anyway I am happy to have prevented another one being cheeted and for the support from the group where you not have heard from me yet. IAs I mentioned I have photos of the sword and copy of the NBTHK  papers and if anyone interested and if it does not interfere with the policy of this group, I can publish it. My plan is to get in contact with worldwide clubs and NBTHK as well and ask peoble if they know anything about this specific sword. To you John, I am most happy that you stopped the payment in time. I have noticed that the seller has stopped the auction as well. I would appreciate so much if you could mail a copy of what you have of any correspondance or photos. Off course not any private informations. Then I will add this further information to the police.<br/>\nThankyou for your support.<br/>\nAll the best<br/>\nAllan<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I have come through this awful case I will join the list more. I have some intersting swords and tsubas as well. I always enjoy and learn from the discussion on this group.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: John Berta <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com\">nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Tuesday, May 18, 2004 4:56 PM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [nihontostudy] Bying on ebay.

This sort of fraud causes every collector nightmares.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Do you own this sword or did you buy it and not have it shipped?<br/>\n<br/>\n  John<br/>\n    ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n    From: Allan Schrattenholz <br/>\n    To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com\">nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n    Sent: Tuesday, May 18, 2004 5:33 AM<br/>\n    Subject: [nihontostudy] Bying on ebay. Don´t get cheeted.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    At present you can find a Kiyosada japanese Sword with NBTHK papers <br/>\n    for sale on ebay. I bought this sword the 21th. of february 2004, <br/>\n    payed it but never received it. By request I received several other <br/>\n    photos of the sword and the NBTHK papers as well as copies from his <br/>\n    passport and driverslicense. This information is avaible for the <br/>\n    list if you don´t find it inconvenient. Look well at this sword on <br/>\n    ebay and take care of wolflady 137 and jnetweb as well as John <br/>\n    Pivec, Minneapolis, USA. This sword will without any doubt be put <br/>\n    for sale again. If anyone has this sword in their possession, please <br/>\n    let me know. I will award informations which will place the sword at <br/>\n    my house with 1000 U.S.dollars. If the Nihonto study group find it <br/>\n    appropiate I will put photos of the sword as well as John Pivecs <br/>\n    passport and driverslicense, on the list. <br/>\n    The Danish Criminal Police, The Danish Foreign Ministry and the USA <br/>\n    Police are involved in the investigation and I have asked ebay to <br/>\n    help with information as well.<br/>\n    Thankyou for your help in advance<br/>\n    All the best<br/>\n    Allan<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n          Yahoo!
