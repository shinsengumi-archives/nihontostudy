The hamon running off <br/>\nthe kissaki IS a fatal flaw, make no bones about that. Swords with fatal <br/>\nflaws that make Tokubetsu Hozon, Juyo or Yashu saku are swords of <br/>\nextraordinary worth, and a flaw that is fatal can not take away it&#39;s <br/>\nhistory. These swords are typically famous because they are rare, or <br/>\nwere carried by someone important or famous. General swords, made by the <br/>\nnot so famous sword smiths, no matter how nice will most likely fail all <br/>\nattempts at kanteisho if theirs is a fatal flaw like the hamon running <br/>\noff the Ha or Kissaki, a Hagiri and the likes.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe all learn hard lessons and we never like being told that our hard <br/>\nearned and well spent money if for naught, but this is a mugs game, it <br/>\ntakes nerves of steel and a firm resolve.
