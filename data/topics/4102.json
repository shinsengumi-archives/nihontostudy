For those of you who have wondered about okita&#39;s swords<br/>\n&gt; please dont worry too much about what happened to them but wonder if<br/>\n&gt; the swords he had was his. I found a website talking about Okita&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; swords and what happened. I shall qoute the paragraphs.&quot;Reproduction<br/>\n&gt; of Souji Okita&#39;s Sword<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sources: Please insert the links below into: babelfish.altavista.com<br/>\n&gt; and click translate from Japanese to English:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Other sources:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.jaxion.com/samurais.net/sword.htm\">http://www.jaxion.com/samurais.net/sword.htm</a><br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.jaxion.com/samurais.net/katana/hm15.htm\">http://www.jaxion.com/samurais.net/katana/hm15.htm</a><br/>\n&gt; www.n-p-s.net/kiyomitu.htm<br/>\n&gt; www.shinsengumihq.com<br/>\n&gt; www.miburo.com<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; (IMG:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://img14.imgspot.com/u/05/97/16/kiyomitu102.jpg)\">http://img14.imgspot.com/u/05/97/16/kiyomitu102.jpg)</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; In fact, a famous sword Okita used at Ikeda-ya (one supposedly made<br/>\n&gt; by Kojiki Kiyomitsu) is said to have broken. This is the sword I&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt; seen on most websites being sold as &quot;Okita&#39;s favorite&quot;.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; According to some sources, after that sword broke, he used a sword<br/>\n&gt; made by Yamatonokami Yasusada. The sword was 2.2 shaku long<br/>\n&gt; according to a source at www.n-p-s.net/aitoh.htm , but my<br/>\n&gt; photocopied page from a swordbook (name of book lost long ago) says<br/>\n&gt; it was 2 shaku, 3 sun, and 6 bu long.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; On a side note, OishiKuwajiro (known by the nickname&quot;<br/>\n&gt; hitokirikuwajiro) also used a sword made by Yamatonokami Yasusada<br/>\n&gt; that was 2 shaku 5 sun in length according to this site<br/>\n&gt; www.bakusin.com/jiten41.html<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Okita&#39;s most famous sword, though, was the &quot;Kikuichimonji&quot;, which<br/>\n&gt; was 2 shaku 4 sun 2 bu in length. There is some speculation as to<br/>\n&gt; whether he actually owned such a valuable sword, but we will<br/>\n&gt; probably never know if he really owned it since it was supposedly<br/>\n&gt; lost after he died. If you are interested in reading more about it,<br/>\n&gt; I recommend Shinsengumi Keppuroku by Shiba Ryotaro.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; As far as the swords being accurate, for sure Hijikata&#39;s is<br/>\n&gt; accurate. Unfortunately the model on that page is the &quot;affordable<br/>\n&gt; model&quot;. The exact replica which is listed on Ozawa swords Japan is<br/>\n&gt; quite a bit more.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Okita&#39;s replica is in what they call handachi (han-dachi)mounts,<br/>\n&gt; literally &quot;half tachi&quot; mounts, which come from the pre-edo periods<br/>\n&gt; where there was a transition from tachi to katana. Unfortunately,<br/>\n&gt; i&#39;ve seen conflicting data on if his Ichimonji blade was mounted in<br/>\n&gt; handachi mounts. He owned one other sword besides the Kiku Ichimonji<br/>\n&gt; and that one could have been the one mounted handachi style.&quot; I hope<br/>\n&gt; this will help you think better and to tell ya we might not ever<br/>\n&gt; find his swords. Thanks for reading this and I hope that someone<br/>\n&gt; will find them.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!
