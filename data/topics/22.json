They actually are sometimes quite thick (around 1<br/>\ncm), but it would seem that any effect on the balance of those swords would<br/>\nhave been negligable.<br/>\nJim<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; What about the use of the tsuba for balancing the sword ? Doesn&#39;t that<br/>\n&gt; play an important role as well ?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I read in a piece by R. B. Caldwell that since the kamakura tachis were<br/>\n&gt; so well balanced by themselves (he described them as prima donnas haha)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; they really only needed a light lacquered leather guard.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So it stands to reason that the Nambokucho massive swords that had<br/>\n&gt; little fumbari were no where near as well balanced and must have needed<br/>\n&gt; massive tsuba to match ??<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Or small ones that were 2.5 inches wide and 1 inch thick of course<br/>\n&gt; hahaha<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; - Matt </span></blockquote></div>",
