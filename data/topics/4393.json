To post photos you need to go to &quot;photos&quot; at the bottom of these emails and post them there, then direct everyone to your &quot;file&quot; once you open a file. Any photos sent as attachments will not make it through, as attachements are deleted. <br/>\n<br/>\nAlways interesting to hear how these swords came into the hands of today&#39;s caretakers. It sounds as if what your father brought home might be more than just mass produced &quot;weapons,&quot; being mounted as you described. Do you know how to remove the handles to look for any maker&#39;s signature? I&#39;m sure somebody here will instruct you on a few &quot;care&quot; pointers, etc. <br/>\n<br/>\nRon<br/>\nSTL<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: cehlers1949 <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com\">nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Monday, May 12, 2008 1:27 PM<br/>\n  Subject: [nihontostudy] New Member<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  I just wanted to say Hi and that I am glad I found this group.
