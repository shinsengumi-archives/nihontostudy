Polishing takes a layer off (more if not done by an expert), <br/>\nand leaves the blade that much more vulnerable to humidity the first <br/>\ncouple of months. I don&#39;t know where you&#39;re located, but the <br/>\nfrequency of your cleanings would depend on the environment, too. The <br/>\nmore humidity the blade is exposed to, the more frequently your sword <br/>\ncleaning kit should be put to use.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope that helps.<br/>\n<br/>\nAndres<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 04:32 PM 9/7/2005, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;I just had a beat-up old sword polished.
