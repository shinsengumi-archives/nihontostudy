Searching on &quot;Saotome&quot; for example turns up 7 entries, but &quot;Saotome tsuba&quot; yields nothing.  Kogai, kozuka, etc., each return a substantial number of hits.  I haven&#39;t had much success searching on koshirae or swords so far.  Image size and quality are adequate, but not great.  Some of the attributions are off and the collection is what it is, but it&#39;s great that the museum has devoted the resources to make this available to us.<br/>\n<br/>\nJim<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
