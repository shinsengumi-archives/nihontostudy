Many years ago, Hal K. used to<br/>\nfrequent the sword shows. Some may remember him.<br/>\n10 or more years ago he sold a Heianjo tsuba (Large round solid plate<br/>\nwith mixed soft metal flowers) to a guy either at the Chicago or<br/>\nFlorida show. In cleaning up his stuff, he has come across the papers<br/>\nfor that tsuba, and would love to unite them with the owner now.<br/>\nSo if anyone thinks they may have it, pop into<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.militaria.co.za/nmb/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=4551\">http://www.militaria.co.za/nmb/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=4551</a> for a pic and<br/>\nsee if you can get your origami 10 years later :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nBrian</div>",
