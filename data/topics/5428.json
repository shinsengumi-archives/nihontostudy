For a start, most Heianjo (real Heianjo and not Edo period <br/>\n  copies) are Momoyama period or earlier. They were mainly made just for a hundred <br/>\n  years or so, basically the 16th century. The earlier pieces are sometimes called <br/>\n  Onin, but even if you include this group, you still only get the period around <br/>\n  1450-1600. That means that they are old. Many were lacquered. Some were well <br/>\n  preserved some were not. The lacquer is part of the overall gestalt. If you see a <br/>\n  hundred Heianjo tsuba, 25 or so will be lacquered, of which 5 will be in excellent <br/>\n  condition, 10 will be decently preserved, 5 will be in need of varying degrees of <br/>\n  restoration and 5 will be dead. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Cheers, <br/>\n<br/>\n  Shirogitsune <br/>\n<br/>\n  --- On Sun, 7/20/08, bungotakadasword &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:MuramasaIII@...\">MuramasaIII@...</a>&gt; wrote: <br/>\n<br/>\n  From: bungotakadasword &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:MuramasaIII@...\">MuramasaIII@...</a>&gt; <br/>\n  Subject: [nihontostudy] clear lacquer <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com\">nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Date: Sunday, July 20, 2008, 1:58 PM <br/>\n<br/>\n  gang, <br/>\n  last time i mentioned noticing &#39; clear lacquer &quot; on most Heianjo tsuba, <br/>\n  people thought i was smoking some good weeds....... .... <br/>\n<br/>\n  Typical response was ........... fire scales <br/>\n<br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.nihontok\">http://www.nihontok</a> anjipages. com/tosogu. com/ <br/>\n<br/>\n  how about that ? <br/>\n<br/>\n  milt <br/>\n<br/>\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed] <br/>\n<br/>\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed] <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n   <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>",

The earlier pieces are sometimes called   <br/>\n Onin, but even if you include this group, you still only get the period around     <br/>\n 1450-1600. That means that they are old. Many were lacquered. Some were well       <br/>\n preserved some were not. The lacquer is part of the overall gestalt. If you see a  <br/>\n hundred Heianjo tsuba, 25 or so will be lacquered, of which 5 will be in excellent <br/>\n condition, 10 will be decently preserved, 5 will be in need of varying degrees of  <br/>\n restoration and 5 will be dead.                                                    <br/>\n                                                                                    <br/>\n Cheers,                                                                            <br/>\n                                                                                    <br/>\n Shirogitsune                                                                       <br/>\n                                                                                    <br/>\n --- On Sun, 7/20/08, bungotakadasword &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:MuramasaIII@...\">MuramasaIII@...</a>&gt; wrote:                 <br/>\n                                                                                    <br/>\n From: bungotakadasword &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:MuramasaIII@...\">MuramasaIII@...</a>&gt;                                       <br/>\n Subject: [nihontostudy] clear lacquer                                              <br/>\n To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com\">nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com</a>                                                   <br/>\n Date: Sunday, July 20, 2008, 1:58 PM                                               <br/>\n                                                                                    <br/>\n gang,                                                                              <br/>\n last time i mentioned noticing &#39; clear lacquer &quot; on most Heianjo tsuba,            <br/>\n people thought i was smoking some good weeds....... ....                           <br/>\n                                                                                    <br/>\n Typical response was ........... fire scales                                       <br/>\n                                                                                    <br/>\n <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.nihontok\">http://www.nihontok</a> anjipages. com/tosogu. com/                                    <br/>\n                                                                                    <br/>\n how about that ?                                                                   <br/>\n                                                                                    <br/>\n milt                                                                               <br/>\n                                                                                    <br/>\n [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]                              <br/>\n                                                                                    <br/>\n [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]                              <br/>\n                                                                                    <br/>\n                                                                                    <br/>\n                                                                                    <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>",

Always like brass inlay on good iron! <br/>\n<br/>\nTo my surprise, I just received what I thought looked like a nice early iron with brass inlay tsuba, recently purchased of Ebay, my first Ebay purchase in ages. After 40-odd years I thought I had a good &quot;eye&quot; for such things; just bought a repro! Yikes! Hope to reverse the deal but must admit that &quot;pictures are deceiving&quot; at times. Looks like an honest mistake on the seller&#39;s part, but it points up the importance of in-hand study. (I think others spotted this since my bid was much too low if authentic. Just mentioning this to point out how good (in pictures only) these repros are today. <br/>\n<br/>\nEnjoyed this topic of lacquer on Heianjo works. I once owned a very similar (or same one?) tsuba that was pointed out here. I need to sit down and check some of my other early tsuba for lacquer. <br/>\n<br/>\nRon<br/>\nSTL<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Dr. Philip Vos Fellman <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com\">nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Monday, July 21, 2008 8:42 AM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [nihontostudy] clear lacquer<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Hi All:<br/>\n   <br/>\n    Heianjo are complex.
