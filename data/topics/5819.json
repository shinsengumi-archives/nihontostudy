Bonhams in England quoted me a price of 141 english pounds<br/>\nto ship 1 regular tsuba. I got a quote from mailbox etc which is around 100 and<br/>\nthat is still disgusting. I know it costs about $20 usd say around 15 pounds<br/>\nto ship. I emailed when I got the original quote and said you must be<br/>\nmistaken. They said that quote is correct, they use an outside vendor but the<br/>\nitem will be delivered to my doorstop. where else would it be delivered to? I<br/>\nfigured at those prices if they have 5-6 customers in NY they could actually<br/>\nsend a person by plane to hand deliver. I am debating what to do, but since I<br/>\nhaven&#39;t gotten a response back asking to speak to a person in charge, it looks<br/>\nlike I won&#39;t be a customer of theirs ever again. I am a strong believer in<br/>\nproviding customer service but when an action like this occurs, it just shows me<br/>\nthey don&#39;t really care. 3rd party or not you as a company are responsible for<br/>\nthe entire experience. If they chose the vendor, it is still part of their<br/>\nservice.
