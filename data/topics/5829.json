            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1179760176\">Members of the list have rightly been sceptical of my find as it is almost unheard of in the West, if I had not seen it myself I would not have believed it either. I have seen many swords with Muromachi/Momoyama style koshirae over the years, but 99.9% have been 19th c. swords in retro style. Two exceptions come to mind: Victor Harris and I catalogued the blades in the Museum of Japanese Sword Fittings in Tokyo for Christie�s in �05. In that collection was a Momoyama tachi koshirae that was later sold in NY, the other was an itomaki tachi made for an Ikeda Daimyo in Christie�s London. Victor has seen this nagamaki and agrees that it is 16th c.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI think this weapon is the first of a number of identical contract pieces for an armoury, as it is numbered �1&#39; as are one seppa, the fuchi and the tsuka in ink under the fuchi, it is utilitarian, with thin yamagane mounts and low quality lacquer, the nakago-ana are not well made. The long ububa can be accounted for by its lack of use, it may have been polished only once or twice then stored for a very long time, this would account for its fairly good condition apart from the leather tsuka binding shrinking and being attacked by insects.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt may look like a sword but it has the thick saya of a polearm, no kurikata and the tsuka is 21.5&quot; long. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs I stated in my earlier post it weighs around 6lbs, this is not something one would want as a personal weapon, it is too heavy and awkward to carry and I think would only be useful in battle.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nI am using the free version of SPAMfighter.<br/>\nWe are a community of 7 million users fighting spam.<br/>\nSPAMfighter has removed 9 of my spam emails to date.<br/>\nGet the free SPAMfighter here: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.spamfighter.com/len\">http://www.spamfighter.com/len</a><br/>\n<br/>\nThe Professional version does not have this message<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",

            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1424859952\">Amazingly at a London auction last week I purchased what I think is a late Muromachi/Momoyama period nagamaki in its original koshirae. The heavy 32.75&quot; blade is unsigned but inscribed �ichi� as are the yamagane fuchi, koi-guchi and one seppa, the open end of the tsuka is similarly marked in ink under the fuchi. The tsuba is 16th century Tachi-kanagushi work lacquered red and may be original to the mounting.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe blade is too discoloured to see any details but it has ububa of 7&quot; and the edge side of the habaki has a slot cut into it to allow for this.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI assume this is the first of a group of similarly mounted weapons ordered by a clan or Temple. I think that the sword has been kept in storage for a very long time as it is not for everyday use, weighing around 6lbs and is 4&#39;7&quot; long overall and is in mostly good condition but with worm holes in the leather bound tsuka<br/>\n<br/>\nI would like to know if anyone on the list has seen a similarly mounted nagamaki, the black sam� and red lacquered binding are distinctive. I would like to know where it came from.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have uploaded images at:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.esnips.com/web/TsubaFittings\">http://www.esnips.com/web/TsubaFittings</a> <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nI am using the free version of SPAMfighter.<br/>\nWe are a community of 7 million users fighting spam.<br/>\nSPAMfighter has removed 9 of my spam emails to date.<br/>\nGet the free SPAMfighter here: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.spamfighter.com/len\">http://www.spamfighter.com/len</a><br/>\n<br/>\nThe Professional version does not have this message<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
