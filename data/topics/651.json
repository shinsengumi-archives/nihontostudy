            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1924899057\">Dear Friends in Nihontô,<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Victorian Government has given notice that it intends to declare ALL SWORDS<br/>\nto be prohibited weapons.  All sorts of nasty consequences flow from this<br/>\nincluding import bans.  A Regulatory Impact Statement (RIS) is available by mail<br/>\nor via the Justice Department&#39;s website.  I urge all Australian collectors to<br/>\nrequest a hard copy by mail and/or download the documents and read them<br/>\nthoroughly.  Submissions close on Monday September 8th.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is particularly important for ALL Australian collectors.  I believe that<br/>\nany law passed in any State jurisdiction can then be immediately written into<br/>\nlaw WITHOUT PUBLIC CONSULTATION by any other State.  As the proposed banning of<br/>\nswords arises out of an all-Australian Police Commissioners meeting you may be<br/>\nsure that if this gets up in Victoria we will see swords declared prohibited<br/>\nweapons without notice all over Australia.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny lover of swords anywhere in the world is also quite free to download the RIS<br/>\nand make a submission to the Victorian Government.  I would be eternally<br/>\ngrateful to anyone who did so and the cause of Nihontô as Art swords will surely<br/>\nbe advanced.  Important swords have been found in Australia and will continue to<br/>\nbe found - unless they wind up being broken and melted down.<br/>\n<br/>\nCalling Colonel Cadwell, where are you.<br/>\n<br/>\nI will try to set something up on a website - Richard Turner??<br/>\n<br/>\nGo here to find the Regulatory Impact Statement.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.justice.vic.gov.au/CA2569020010922A/Homepage?OpenForm\">http://www.justice.vic.gov.au/CA2569020010922A/Homepage?OpenForm</a><br/>\n<br/>\nClick on the top link labelled<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Draft Control of Weapons and Firearms (Search Powers) Regulations 2003&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nand you will pull up three documents as follows:<br/>\n<br/>\nRegulatoryImpactStatement.pdf (173kb)<br/>\nProposedControlofWeapons(Amendment)Regulations2003.pdf (14kb)<br/>\nProposedFirearms(SearchPowers)Regulations2003.pdf (12kb)<br/>\n<br/>\nBest regards,<br/>\nBarry Thomas<br/>\n(Melbourne, Australia)</div>",
