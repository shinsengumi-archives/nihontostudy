However, I have to say that Akasaka would<br/>\nbe difficult to defend.  That mokko shape would be very unusual for<br/>\nAkasaka.  Their seppa dai tended to be more narrow and were often<br/>\nsomewhat to very pointed at the top in the early generations.  The broad<br/>\nshape would be, again unusual.  They didn&#39;t normally do quadrilateral<br/>\nsymmetry like that and the hitsuana are also not typical, although<br/>\nTadashige often made &quot;dovetails&quot; for (often non-existent) sekigane like<br/>\nwe see here on the kozuka ana side.  Akasaka construction often used a<br/>\nhard, smooth kawagane that looks quite different from the texture of the<br/>\niron on this guard.  The rim is usually very round in the early<br/>\ngenerations.<br/>\n<br/>\nBUT... there are a bunch of signed Akasaka guards by later generations<br/>\nthat are not obviously in Akasaka style based on the carving, motifs and<br/>\neven inlay.  It&#39;s an interesting study.   The first Akasaka died around<br/>\n1657, FWIW.  Pretty sure it&#39;s not an Akasaka piece, though.<br/>\n<br/>\nWriting opinions is a great way to learn.

The style of the sukashi is more like Kyo work, <br/>\n  though.  It&#39;s difficult to judge iron from photographs, but it <br/>\n  doesn&#39;t look typically Owari.  I&#39;ve seen guards that looked quite <br/>\n  like Owari be judged as Shoami because of uncertainty over the lack <br/>\n  of some classic characteristic or other.  Some of these sukashi <br/>\n  pieces can be very difficult to pigeonhole with confidence because <br/>\n  they share characteristics of Kyo and Owari.  My guess is that your <br/>\n  guard would be attributed to Shoami.  Probably early Edo period or a <br/>\n  bit older.<br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt;   The other guard is interesting.  Some of that type have plates <br/>\n  like Kamakura bori and have a simple carving around the rim.  Others <br/>\n  have plates more like Onin guards.  Both types can have a simple <br/>\n  ring or two of brass inlay.  I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve seen an example that <br/>\n  has the rim hammered like yours, but aesthetically it seems like the <br/>\n  same idea as the carved decoration seen on others.<br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt;   The style of the plate, the shape of the kozuka ana and the <br/>\n  simple inlay decoration would all point to an Onin attribution.    <br/>\n  How thick is it?  Probably mid Muromachi at least.<br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt;   Jim<br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt;     Gentlemen:<br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt;     I really have problems with attribution on these early tsuba:<br/>\n  &gt;     http://www.nihontophile.com/Suk1.jpg<br/>\n  &gt;     http://www.nihontophile.com/Suk2.jpg<br/>\n  &gt;     http://www.nihontophile.com/Suk3.jpg<br/>\n  &gt;     Tsuba is 7.2 tall x 6.9 cm wide; 4 mm thick at the mimi.<br/>\n  &gt;     I first thought Ko-Shoami because of the fine sukashi work.<br/>\n  &gt;     But it looks Owari (and has bones in the rim). However it is <br/>\n  on the <br/>\n  &gt;     small side..which would place it late but it looks early and <br/>\n  has <br/>\n  &gt;     obviously been mounted many times.<br/>\n  &gt;     What about Kyo-Shoami?<br/>\n  &gt;     (perhaps some day I will get it down.....:)<br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt;     Also this tsuba has given me a fit as to attribution/age:<br/>\n  &gt;     http://www.nihontophile.com/html/gallery.html<br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt;     Any help would be much appreciated.<br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt;     Kind regards,<br/>\n  &gt;     Ron P.<br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt;           Yahoo!
