It supported my own thoughts about Namban<br/>\nand also taught me a few things. Some sections are<br/>\nmuch more worthwhile than others and it is light on<br/>\nillustrations, but I&#39;m glad I bought it and would<br/>\nrecommend it to anyone who has ever thought about<br/>\nowning a Namban tsuba.

Dr John Lissenden uses this redefinition as<br/>\n&gt; the starting point in his accessible, creative and<br/>\n&gt; thoroughly researched study of Namban tsuba, for<br/>\n&gt; which he was awarded the degree of Master of Arts in<br/>\n&gt; East Asian Studies by the University of Durham in<br/>\n&gt; 2002.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The author has made good use of the research that<br/>\n&gt; has been previously done by European and Japanese<br/>\n&gt; students, but has also been originally critical of<br/>\n&gt; some of the established scholarship.

Including, as it does, expositions<br/>\n&gt; on both gilding and casting as related to this group<br/>\n&gt; of tsuba, the authors reappraisal also uses the<br/>\n&gt; data on sword furniture as a new source of insight<br/>\n&gt; and information on historical developments in East<br/>\n&gt; Asia during the 16th to 18th centuries.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; B&W -<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote><a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1554043654/002-3046604-2029634\">http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1554043654/002-3046604-2029634</a><br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Paperback - Color -<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.lulu.com/content/360453\">http://www.lulu.com/content/360453</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hardback - Color -<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.lulu.com/content/361355\">http://www.lulu.com/content/361355</a><br/>\n&gt; _________________<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.derondouglas.com\">http://www.derondouglas.com</a><br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.double-dragon-ebooks.com\">http://www.double-dragon-ebooks.com</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been<br/>\n&gt; removed]<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTired of spam?
