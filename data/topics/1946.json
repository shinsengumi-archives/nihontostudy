            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-171595894\">All, as an off topic on this, I was talking with a mate the other day on <br/>\nthe sad passing of Fujishiro sensei and how these great men are being <br/>\nreplaced. Cary Condell speaks very highly of Fujishiro Matsuo&#39;s son, <br/>\nFujishiro Okisato and I take him on his word on this matter. It is <br/>\nwonderful to know this organization is in good hands. My friend and I <br/>\nwere also talking of other more &quot;singular&quot; giants of nihonto such as <br/>\nShibata Sensei and who his replacement would be in his business. This <br/>\nled me to Hagihara Sensei, does he have a protege ?, who will replace <br/>\nhim when he passes on or retires ?. Is there much in the way of up and <br/>\ncoming&#39;s in line after the likes of Shibata, Tanobe and other sensei ?.<br/>\n<br/>\nRich Turner<br/>\n<br/>\narnold frenzel wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Hi Jim:<br/>\n&gt; Can you confirm that Hagihara sensei will still be doing the kodogu at<br/>\n&gt; Chicago?

The motif is a<br/>\nmemento mori as you say.  Sometimes that motif is tied to Sekigahara,<br/>\nbut seems like it could fit any battle.<br/>\n<br/>\nJim<br/>\n<br/>\n  wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">   &gt; Just picked up this tsuba off ebay.
