I have a few copies remaining here which are available for sale by mail if anyone is interested. <br/>\n<br/>\nPrint quality is high quality, hardcover with slip-cover, 116 pages showing color photos of tosogu exhibited including 17 double pages of period koshirae, in color. An article extensively researched  by Fred Geyer on what has been previously considered Tokei (clockgear) tsuba, today realized to be a Christian motif, and an interesting interview with Kengo Sekido is also in the catalogue. I&#39;ve posted a few photos of the catalogue on Yahoo photos in my folder named, Ron STL. Perhaps this link will work for you. <br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://tinyurl.com/q4uz2\">http://tinyurl.com/q4uz2</a><br/>\n<br/>\nPrice postpaid to USA address: $65<br/>\nPrice postpaid to Canadian address: $75<br/>\n<br/>\nTo order or to ask me any questions about this catalogue, contact me off-list please: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:swords@...\">swords@...</a> <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks guys and gals! <br/>\n<br/>\nRon<br/>\nSTL<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>",
