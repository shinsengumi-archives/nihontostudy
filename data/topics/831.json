We don&#39;t see these types of mounts very often - if ever <br/>\nreally.  The carving work is very intricate, and this is a pretty <br/>\nold set.  The blade is very old with 4 holes in the nakago, it is <br/>\nsigned Yoshimitsu, but the signature has been welded on.  It also <br/>\nhas a few openings on the surface.<br/>\n<br/>\nI will have a more detailed description on ebay.  If you have any <br/>\nquestions please feel free to ask, I also have many pictures of it.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere is a link to some pictures:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://members.rogers.com/rskeboa170/efu/index.html\">http://members.rogers.com/rskeboa170/efu/index.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nRegards,<br/>\n<br/>\nLouis</div>",
