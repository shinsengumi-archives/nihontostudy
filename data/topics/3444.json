In a couple of months or so I&#39;ll<br/>\nbe retired and I intend to follow up on these with the police to identify all<br/>\nthe swords involved in &quot;samurai sword&quot; attacks here in Victoria leading up to<br/>\nthe infamous, ignorant and outrageous laws that we are well aware of.  John&#39;s<br/>\nemail (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:excelsiorilluminati@...\">excelsiorilluminati@...</a>) spoke of:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; These attacks on people with &#39;Samurai Swords&#39; are<br/>\n&gt; the exact reason there has been legislation enacted<br/>\n&gt; already with more being contemplated in certain parts<br/>\n&gt; of the world.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>More information please.  I think my home state of Victoria here in Oz was the<br/>\nfirst in the West to introduce laws as a direct result of &quot;samurai sword&quot;<br/>\nattacks, and we have heard of the Scottish move.  Anything else??  Any more<br/>\ndetails??  Perhaps it might be better to reply to me offline in this<br/>\n&quot;developmental&quot; stage??  We can take the list&#39;s time and bandwidth in the event<br/>\nof concrete actions by legislators.  OR - keep the discussion online until<br/>\nsomeone complains??  Personally I&#39;m &#39;red-hot&#39; on somehow correcting the<br/>\nignorance of our legislature here in Victoria as well as the media.  Not sure<br/>\nhow I&#39;ll go about a one-man, retired old geezer moral minority campaign gainst<br/>\nabysmal ignorance, but once retired I&#39;ll have &#39;the rest of my life&#39; to get into<br/>\nit...<br/>\n<br/>\nBest regards,<br/>\n<br/>\nBarry Thomas<br/>\n(Melbourne, Australia)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;David Zincavage&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jdz@...\">jdz@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:token_kenkyu_kai@...\">token_kenkyu_kai@...</a>&gt;; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com\">nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Saturday, November 05, 2005 6:30 AM<br/>\nSubject: Anybody in Oz know what kind of sword?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.news.com.au/story/0,10117,17114699-421,00.html\">http://www.news.com.au/story/0,10117,17114699-421,00.html</a> </span></blockquote></div>",
