This is a dated (Bunka 7 - 1810 if I read the script correctly) wakizashi signed: Kozuke kuni (place-name?) ju (smith?). Yahoo photo links are:<br/>\n<br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://tinyurl.com/x0f1\">http://tinyurl.com/x0f1</a>       <br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://tinyurl.com/x0f9\">http://tinyurl.com/x0f9</a><br/>\n<br/>\n  These photos are labeled &quot;Kozuke kuni 1 and 2&quot; (earlier question&#39;s links/photos are labeled &quot;Ron STL&quot;)<br/>\n<br/>\n  I&#39;ve searched, again unsuccessfully, for a town-name in Kozuke province that might have these characters in the name, but the first character I can not pronounce; the second looks like &quot;mura&quot; but could also be pronounced differently. Anybody have any suggestions???<br/>\n<br/>\n  Notice I&#39;ve also left the smith&#39;s name unknown. The rubbing simply did not pick it up clearly enough. It could be something like Sadahiro with the final character being the kanji for &quot;katana&quot; which--and it seems somebody mentioned this several months ago--refers to the maker of the sword. Anyway, here is another excercise for you to entertain yourselves with and hopefully, help to answer my questions about this mei.  Thanks!<br/>\n<br/>\n  Ron<br/>\n  STL<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
