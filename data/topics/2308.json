            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1562849363\">gang,<br/>\nhappy to report the sword is found and located. It is with the <br/>\nprankster  and he promised not to dip the sword in acid to enhance <br/>\nthe hamon nor wack  the &quot; bushies &quot; ( ops, sorry about that ).<br/>\nThe prank was meant as a &quot; lesson &quot; to me for  &quot; thinking &quot; that  <br/>\nthere&#39;s a possibility  a hard working cleaning person could <br/>\nliberated  it from my hotel room ( a resonable possibility as I can&#39;t <br/>\nrecall exactly when/where the sword  was missed , if I can, then it <br/>\nwon&#39;t  go missing, yes ? ). The reason it went missing was I left it <br/>\nin the shinsa room. Absent-mindedness, it comes with advancing age.<br/>\nSo,  My appology to all the lists for causing all the fuss.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing I learned from this  &quot; prank &quot;......................<br/>\n The  show organisers are quick with members&#39;  concern, when I <br/>\nreported  the e-bay listing  very early in the morning ( through e-<br/>\nmail ), I got an immediate response. They contacted the hotel <br/>\nsecurity immediately and initiated an investigation which I have to <br/>\nlater explain that it could be a possible prank.   Not funny.<br/>\n<br/>\nLastly ,thank you all for the concerns, suggestions.  I am glad the <br/>\nsword is not with some wackos who may actually use it to wack the <br/>\nbushies  ( ops, sorry about that, again ).<br/>\n<br/>\nMilt</div>",
