            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1936404563\">Friends:<br/>\n I have been away for a few days and seeing this message today has come<br/>\nas a shock and with it a real feeling of loss. While we have never met in<br/>\nperson, I corresponded with Mr. Han for many years and always found his<br/>\nletters full of scholarship and interesting insights. While there are now<br/>\nmore and more well informed and scholarly people outside Japan, I<br/>\nbelieve Mr. Han was without peer and his passing will leave a void that<br/>\nwill not be filled in the near future. His knowledge and analytical mind<br/>\nhas been noted widely inside Japan and out, and the sword community has<br/>\nlost a true friend. I understand that his latest work, a compendium of<br/>\nswords found and recorded in the Netherlands and rendered in English, is<br/>\nsoon to leave the printer. I am sure it will stand as a lasting monument<br/>\nto his scholarship. I extend my prayerful sympathy to all of those who<br/>\nknew him personally.<br/>\n<br/>\nArnold Frenzel<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:afrenzel@...\">afrenzel@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Wed, 24 Sep 2003, alchemyst wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Forward from Rich T&#39;s message board:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I have just received an email from a Oranda Token Kai member telling <br/>\n&gt; me on the passing yesterday of Han Bing<br/>\n&gt;       Siong.
