            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1945757824\">Tom --<br/>\n<br/>\nRe: Iron Dragon Tsuba -- Photos in folder entitled SOSIDORE<br/>\n<br/>\nThe captioned tsuba could be an artifact that can best illustrate <br/>\nthe historical cultural exchange between China and Japan before <br/>\nfirst Sino-Japanese war. <br/>\nJapan used to send contribution to Chinese emperors since as long <br/>\nago as 8th century A.D. And swords were among the list of Japanese <br/>\ncontributions. In return China had Japanese delegate brought home <br/>\nmuch much more than they gave. I did not invent stories like this. <br/>\nChinese history had had ample records about them. I would believe <br/>\nthat in Tokyo palace vault there are tremendous number of treasury <br/>\nthat once were gifts from Chinese emperors. They must have been well <br/>\ndocumented. Japanese gives and takes. I wish someday Chinese <br/>\nfriendship contributions could be made possible for all to see. <br/>\nNow, why am I so sure that the captioned tsuba was made in Japan? <br/>\nApart from material, workmanship and style in general, the most <br/>\nobvious point in focus is the mustach of the dragon. The dragon on <br/>\nthis tsuba is thick with mustach. That is what so unique about it. <br/>\nPlease try to take a strong view on Meiji silver one-yen coin. The <br/>\nJapanese dragon design on the said coin is thick with mustach, too. <br/>\nThere should be no one challenge the authenticity of Japanese dragon <br/>\non Japanese one-yen Meiji silver coin. In case of Chinese dragon, <br/>\nthe dragons are mustach free since Ming and Ching dynasty. <br/>\nInteresting parties will please visit two web pages listed below. <br/>\nThey are equally authentically emperial style in China. Please note <br/>\nthe dragons there. No mustach.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.wallcoo.com/photograph/chinese_culture/html/image50.html\">http://www.wallcoo.com/photograph/chinese_culture/html/image50.html</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://tya.myrime.com/cgi-bin/view.cgi?forum=5&topic=2963\">http://tya.myrime.com/cgi-bin/view.cgi?forum=5&topic=2963</a><br/>\nI would like to suggest something here. The implication of my <br/>\nfinding point out an interesting direction for tsuba collectors to <br/>\npursue. Some tsubas used to bear a mission of introducing things <br/>\nJapan to foreign people. Japan was on the rice during Meiji period. <br/>\nThey were eager to introduce themselves to the world. Next time when <br/>\nyou are about to make a choice of collection take a strong view and <br/>\nthink. Is this tsuba specially made with people like me in mind? If <br/>\nyou do then you hold a mysterious key that could open a cross time <br/>\ndialog with the original creator far away and long ago in a country <br/>\ncall Japan.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHappy New Year.<br/>\n<br/>\nYing-Chaw<br/>\nTaipei<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com\">nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com</a>, Tom Helm &lt;junkmail@t...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Ying-Chaw-<br/>\n&gt; \tIt is an interesting possibility.

            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-596314179\">In China it would be unthinkable to have tsuba made using dragon as <br/>\ninsignia. Some might challenge my view by asking, ¡°But I do find <br/>\nthat dragon designs appear on robes that Chinese emperor used to <br/>\nwear.¡± That is quite right. Only that custom as a rule is quite <br/>\nexceptional in case of tsuba. We all know that tsuba is intended for <br/>\nhand protection. The tsuba will receive heavy chopping force <br/>\ninitiated by the enemy. In case of dragon tsuba sword, it would mean <br/>\nthat the emperor was getting hit each time the tsuba received chops <br/>\nby the enemy. Damage of any kind on the dragon of this tsuba would <br/>\nimply that the emperor¡¯s fate would soon be as damaged as the tsuba.<br/>\nThere never was rules prohibiting Chinese craftsman to produce tsuba <br/>\nwith dragon insignia on it. The idea simply would not come up in <br/>\nanyone¡¯s mind in China. As a matter of fact I seriously doubt that <br/>\nthe Japanese sword bearing this dragon tsuba never ever reached <br/>\nChinese Palace. The Chinese Foreign Trade officer would have singled <br/>\nit out from the list of Japanese contributions and confiscated the <br/>\nsword along with the palms burning dragon tsuba. A sword¡¯s blade <br/>\nwith dragon designs engraved on it? Yes, it is possible. And I <br/>\nmyself can show you ancient swords to that effect. Why was it <br/>\npossible? Well, blade is something that has power of hitting ones <br/>\nenemy. The idea goes harmoniously well with the powerful image of an <br/>\nemperor. You just could not put a Chinese emperor on a tsuba in form <br/>\nof a dragon in order to expose His powerless position of getting hit <br/>\nrepeatedly by his enemy.<br/>\nThe issue of whether or not this tsuba being made in Japan really <br/>\nrest with the authentication result of the dragon design itself. <br/>\nThere are differences in terms of detail design between Japan and <br/>\nChina. May be the Japanese royal artifact specialist would be more <br/>\ninterested to do the authentication. I strongly believe that, well <br/>\nmade or not, this tsuba was of Japanese origin. <br/>\nI have posted two more photos of the tsuba I am referring to just in <br/>\ncase anyone of you would like to take a stronger view. (Photos <br/>\nplaced in folder named SOSIDORE)<br/>\nIn my previous message I once proclaimed that five claws and only <br/>\nfive claws can prove that the dragon concerned was exclusively <br/>\ncrafted for Chinese emperor. It was not true. The more I studied the <br/>\nmore evidence indicated that four claws or even three claws dragons <br/>\nhad been found to be owned by Chinese emperors.

            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1636950438\">Hi Barry and Mr. Chen;<br/>\n<br/>\nInteresting thread.  While there is quite a bit of evidence relating to the trade in weapons in the Muromachi period between Japan and China, the style of the tsuba you have illustrated is not of a style from this period of trade, but from a much later period.  There have been many discussions trying to determine what happened to the thousands of swords exported to China during this period.  Also the popular opinion is that these swords were mounted in koshira, so would have had the required tsuba and other fittings, at least on a portion of the swords exported even if not all.  Seeing as the numbers exported were in the tens of thousands over a long period, it seems reasonable to think there should be a quantity of tsuba remaining from these weapons.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere is a link to a picture of a tsuba that I think was made for this export market in Japan, and it is in the style and iron of the period used in Japan, it is the second picture from the top.  If you look at the next picture it is of a similar style of tsuba but the iron is different as is the style of construction and it is from a later period of production even though of a similar style, and is about 100 years later in manufacture.  This would cause one to wonder if this trade continued though the years but perhaps in smaller quantities.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www3.telus.net/sword/sword/index.htm/MyWebs6/tsb1gal.htm\">http://www3.telus.net/sword/sword/index.htm/MyWebs6/tsb1gal.htm</a><br/>\n<br/>\nJohn<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Barry Thomas <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com\">nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Thursday, November 17, 2005 4:20 AM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [nihontostudy] Re: A good story about one tsuba with some interesting details missing<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Mr Chen Ying-chaw wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt; It was Japan who kept the record in detail about presenting<br/>\n  &gt; swords to Chinese emperors during 15th century.

So, given this lack of specific<br/>\n  knowledge about the Japan-China trade in Nihonto I can only go by the tsuba AS A<br/>\n  TSUBA in the context of my Japanese-centred knowledge.

I believe this is known as the<br/>\nKango Trade in the Kamakura period and later.  This was published in English<br/>\nabout 25 or so years ago in the USA - one of the Tai Kai publications. I had not<br/>\nread of the Trade in the early Shinto period/late Ming, but of course this is<br/>\nnot a well-researched area in the West, nor, I guess, in China either given the<br/>\nvicissitudes of the past 110 years.  With this lack of knowledge it isn&#39;t<br/>\nsurprising that no one (?) on this list knows anything about such a tsuba as Mr<br/>\nChen Ying-chaw has drawn our attention to.  So, given this lack of specific<br/>\nknowledge about the Japan-China trade in Nihonto I can only go by the tsuba AS A<br/>\nTSUBA in the context of my Japanese-centred knowledge.  More and better quality<br/>\nimages of this very interesting tsuba are warranted given the queries and issues<br/>\nraised.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve looked long and hard at the very interesting image Mr Chen Ying-chaw has<br/>\ndrawn our attention to, and I note the following:<br/>\n<br/>\n- the quality of the work is poor.<br/>\n- note particularly the asymmetric shape of the nakago ana, as I have mentioned<br/>\n- note also the clumsy, unrefined shape of the seppa dai outline<br/>\n- note also the nakago ana placement in the seppa dai lacks symmetry.<br/>\n- finally, the mimi (rim) varies in width in a manner most uncharacteristic of<br/>\n  Japanese tsubako.<br/>\n<br/>\nBeing familiar with the exquisite excellence of Japanese metal work in tsuba and<br/>\nfuchigashira, I cannot accept that this tsuba was made under the auspices of the<br/>\nJapanese Emperor for the Chinese Emperor.  Let me propose another theory.<br/>\n<br/>\nMr Chen Ying-chaw notes:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 1. Chinese emperor was the only one who is entitled<br/>\n&gt; to put dragon decors on everything he owned.<br/>\n&gt; 2. However dragons could also put to use as icons by<br/>\n&gt; other persons or entities only if the number of dragon&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; fingers reduced to either 4 or 3. Five fingers claws must<br/>\n&gt; not be used in any dragon unless the owner of that<br/>\n&gt; dragon design is Chinese emperor himself. Violation of<br/>\n&gt; such rule was subject to capital punishment.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>However, in Japan the dragon is a very common theme on all manner of things.<br/>\nGranted I have only seen 3 fingered dragons in Japanese art, but the so-called<br/>\nCanton tsuba were imported into Japan and I suggest that this tsuba could be of<br/>\nChinese origin intended to be exported to Japan at one time.  Supporting this<br/>\ntheory is the observation that this tsuba appears to have never been fitted to a<br/>\nsword, as indeed a great number of Japanese tsuba were never fitted to swords.<br/>\nI cannot recall seeing hitsuana of the specific type shown in the image.<br/>\n<br/>\nFinally, Mr Chen Ying-chaw wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Time and again in China, very fine quality old Japanese<br/>\n&gt; swords (for royal use?) can still be found. Some with<br/>\n&gt; tsuba missing<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Some years ago there was a very comprehensive (but not particularly<br/>\ninformative!) exchange of views on Nihonto in China on these sword lists - I<br/>\nstill have the correspondence in my archive.  There was no conclusive<br/>\ninformation of &quot;very fine quality old Japanese swords&quot; being found in China.<br/>\nI&#39;m sure we would all like to hear more about such finds with pictures and<br/>\nscholarly information if they exist.  Indeed, the article on the Kango Trade<br/>\nspeculated that many of the very best quality Koto were exported to China and<br/>\nhoped that some could still be found and restored to the world.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis exhausts my poor and inadequate opinion, so now I will retire from the<br/>\nlists and hope someone can offer a more definitive opinion.  I stand by my<br/>\nopinion that this is NOT a Japanese-made item.<br/>\n<br/>\nBest regards,<br/>\n<br/>\nBarry Thomas<br/>\n(Melbourne, Australia)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;sosidore&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sosidore@...\">sosidore@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com\">nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Thursday, November 17, 2005 2:29 PM<br/>\nSubject: [nihontostudy] Re: A good story about one tsuba with some interesting<br/>\ndetails missing<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was Japan who kept the record in detail about presenting swords to<br/>\nChinese emperors during 15th century.

The head of the dragon after the pearl seems <br/>\nto be undefined, or maybe too busy don&#39;t you think? John</div>",

I would like to give some clue so that readers of this <br/>\nmessage would came up with similar beliefe as I did.<br/>\n<br/>\n1. Chinese emperor was the only one who is entitled to put dragon <br/>\ndecors on everything he owned. <br/>\n2. However dragons could also put to use as icons by other persons or <br/>\nentities only if the number of dragon&#39;s fingers reduced to either 4 <br/>\nor 3. Five fingers claws must not be used in any dragon unless the <br/>\nowner of that dragon design is Chinese emperor himself. Violation of <br/>\nsuch rule was subject to capital punishment.<br/>\n3. There used to be a continued flow of sword import from Japan <br/>\ndating back more than a thousand years.<br/>\n4. Swords as possibly one of the contributions to Chinese emperor <br/>\nduring Qing Dynasty would demand unique design for their tsubas. <br/>\nGuess what design would it use?<br/>\n5. Any contribution to the king would bear no signature of the <br/>\nartist. Guess what? This elegant iron tsuba bear no signature on <br/>\nneither side.  <br/>\n6. I am in no position to do the authentication on the style of the <br/>\ndragon shown on this tsuba. Somehow its style poised to resemble the <br/>\none shown on Meiji coins. There is strong likelihood that this tsuba <br/>\nwas of Japan origin dating back to late 19th century.<br/>\n7. Guess who is in the position in Japan to offer this tsuba as part <br/>\nof a sword to Chinese emperor then?<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope you enjoy as much as I when pondering the answers to those <br/>\nquestions. You probably would find some interesting part of details <br/>\nmissing. Readers and I would like to hear them.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, it is time that tsuba expert and historians take over <br/>\nauthentication processes from here. <br/>\n<br/>\nChen, Ying-chaw<br/>\nTaipei</div>",
