The way that the decoration crowds and crosses the edge gives me the sense that the plate was cut down a bit.  A fukurin was typically added to a guard that was cut down or otherwise damaged at the edge.  There are plenty of tsuba with original fukurin too, usually for aesthetic reasons.  Also, functional original fukurin were used to bind the edge of three layer copper alloy guards or on nerikawa tsuba.  Some fukurin (original or added) may have been intended to keep the edge of a guard from catching on or damaging clothing.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe motif isn&#39;t lightning.  It&#39;s a very loose manju/key-fret design.  I don&#39;t recall the Japanese term.  The Raijin guard shows the square-spiral typical of the ends of lightning.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know what relationship the kanji on the edge of the box have to the tsuba.  Of course the interior can be fitted to the guard even if the box was used before. <br/>\n<br/>\nJim<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Jim,<br/>\n<br/>\n  It&#39;s the one linked by this url.
