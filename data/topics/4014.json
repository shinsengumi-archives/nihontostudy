Some would say more refined, others would say more <br/>\nboring.  Think Kyo-sukashi, Heianjo, Onin, Kaneie, etc.  Usually it <br/>\nis more of a brown color rather than blue-black of Owari (all <br/>\ncaveats about color in effect).<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s probably not possible to explain without examples in hand, <br/>\n </span></blockquote>but try to look carefully at the photos.

Nobuie was probably the first to make heavier guards, but I&#39;d have to think about that a bit more.<br/>\n<br/>\nRegarding Owari iron, go back through the previous kantei two albums and as a group consider the metal, hammer work, tekkotsu and &quot;melted&quot; finish.  These are all typical of early Owari area work.  Also this album about tekkotsu<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://ph.groups.yahoo.com/group/nihontostudy/photos/browse/d4b0\">http://ph.groups.yahoo.com/group/nihontostudy/photos/browse/d4b0</a> are all Owari region.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy comparison Kyoto iron has a softer look to it, more homogenous, shows less modulation in the hammering, generally does not show prominent tekkotsu or a melted finish (although some Ko-Shoami will have this).  Some would say more refined, others would say more boring.  Think Kyo-sukashi, Heianjo, Onin, Kaneie, etc.  Usually it is more of a brown color rather than blue-black of Owari (all caveats about color in effect).<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s probably not possible to explain without examples in hand, but try to look carefully at the photos.  Even with examples in hand it takes some years of effort to see.<br/>\n<br/>\nJim<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: steven <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com\">nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Sunday, March 19, 2006 9:31 PM<br/>\n  Subject: [nihontostudy] Re: tsuba kantei 3 setsumei<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Marvelous tsuba, Jim.
