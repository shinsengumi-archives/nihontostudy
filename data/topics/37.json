Clearly you have major issues with the courier you are using and the police should be involved immediately upon any suspicious activity, but please do not besmirch the efforts of the Japanese Canadian Cultural Centre as it attempts to educate people on the samurai sword. Senior members of the JSS/US are active participants in this group and I am sure they are not going to be a party to any activity that does not promote a complete respect for the sword and its history.
