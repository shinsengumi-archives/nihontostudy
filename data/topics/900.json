I think the<br/>\nsecond statement you made about the pricing is also not based on good<br/>\nresearch.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m the owner of the tanto. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo I obviously disagree about the pricing aspect (which was actually set<br/>\nfor me by one of the most respected members of the non-Japanese sword<br/>\ncommunity), but it&#39;s kind of pointless to try to argue that kind of<br/>\nthing. I&#39;ll settle for explaining how I look at pricing for any<br/>\nparticular piece.<br/>\n<br/>\nPricing is subjective to begin with, and your model for finding a<br/>\nfitting replacement for this piece in the marketplace I think is missing<br/>\nout on several aspects.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome aspects of a collectable piece can be compared and contrasted<br/>\nsimply. The habaki, the sayagaki, the shirasaya, the papers. The costs<br/>\nof these are all fairly flat and known and can be added into the bottom<br/>\nline and calculated easily.<br/>\n<br/>\nBeyond that, &quot;koto tanto&quot; is a very broad and vague term, kind of<br/>\nequivalent to saying &quot;old painting.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are &quot;old paintings&quot; available for next to nothing, and some &quot;old<br/>\npaintings&quot; are priced in the hundred million dollar range. If you are<br/>\njust in the market for an &quot;old painting&quot; with price as your guide, then<br/>\npretty much everything by comparison is overpriced vs. anything from the<br/>\nbargain bin.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhere you really want to start with a piece like this I think is with<br/>\nthe smith, rather than the period, and his ratings and valuations.<br/>\n<br/>\nNaotsuna is a very famous smith, he is one of the &quot;Masamune Juttetsu&quot;<br/>\nthough modern scholarship considers he probably had no direct<br/>\nrelationship. Some still believe, but regardless of either, he is part<br/>\nof the old stories. He is considered Jo-jo saku by Fujishiro, and this<br/>\nis a very high rating achieved by very few smiths. <br/>\n<br/>\nHe is also rated at 850 man yen in the Toko Taikan, or 8.5 million yen<br/>\nfor a Juyo Token daito quality piece. Cut that in half for a tanto. Some<br/>\nmight say the piece has to be signed, but for many of these smiths there<br/>\nare no signed works and it is not clear that the Toko Taikan was<br/>\nintended to be used like that. Rather, if you use a &quot;high&quot; Juyo Token as<br/>\nthe basis I think it works better.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo beginning with 4.25M yen, we can split that in half again for a<br/>\nTokubetsu Hozon piece. So now we&#39;re down to about 2.12 million yen. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe can probably split that in half because the piece has endured many<br/>\npolishes. I am trying to not nickel and dime this on the way down.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis gives us 1.05 million yen. Since tanto are rare in the scope of<br/>\nNaotsuna&#39;s work, this makes the piece more attractive. Say add<br/>\n10%. Horimono add I think 20% to the value of a work, and since horimono<br/>\nare virtually non-existent in the body of Naotsuna&#39;s work, we can add<br/>\nperhaps another 5%. That works out to about 1.46M yen, or around<br/>\n$12,700.00.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis number probably includes something like the dollars spent on<br/>\npapering, but may not include the factors such as the quality of the<br/>\nhabaki (gold foil, silver foil, solid, etc) and the sayagaki. In a lower<br/>\npriced piece like this, it is fair to weigh out these aspects.<br/>\n<br/>\nI tried to use commonly accepted values in the calculation, but each<br/>\nperson may have their own subjective valuation for each aspect that may<br/>\nchange the total. And that is how things should be, some aspects do not<br/>\nmatter to some people, and they do to others. Ideally, you want to come<br/>\nto some kind of collective representation in your pricing model that<br/>\nembraces as much as possible.<br/>\n<br/>\nI mentioned up top that I sought out advice from one of the most<br/>\nknowledgable and respected members of the community before I set my<br/>\npricing, and I priced it in line with his instructions.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith the &quot;valued&quot; pricing in mind, one has to remember that the ideal<br/>\nprice for any unique item like this should be considered &quot;too high&quot; by<br/>\nat least 95% of the people considering it. That is, most should look at<br/>\nthe piece and weigh out in favor of keeping their cash in their wallet.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you have priced something so that 95% of the people considering it<br/>\nwill exchange cash for the piece you are selling, this means you have<br/>\ncome in far below fair market pricing and have caused yourself<br/>\ninjury. If you have priced it such that 100% of the people find it too<br/>\nexpensive, well then it will sit there forever and you will end up<br/>\nrepricing it in the future :-).<br/>\n<br/>\nBecause most people may not buy it at a given price, doesn&#39;t mean<br/>\nsomething is overpriced.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m really uncomfortable with having to come out and make a comment, but<br/>\nas you had already erred on the seller, I felt that it was important for<br/>\nme to at least defend my decisions as there is some rationality behind<br/>\nthem. And, as I mentioned, it was mostly based on the advice of someone<br/>\nwith 30+ years of experience doing this.<br/>\n<br/>\nLastly, I am not a dealer, I am just a collector and am going to have to<br/>\nrotate pieces out of my collection from time to time. <br/>\n<br/>\nTo conclude, I personally think that this is an example of why pricing<br/>\ndiscussions should be kept off the nihonto study list (at least). In the<br/>\nend they&#39;re a matter for subjectivity, and careless comments about who<br/>\nowns what, and what is priced where can cause people a lot of injury.<br/>\n<br/>\nThose are more appropriately comments to reserve to private<br/>\nconversations, where if you are incorrect on anything, the scope of<br/>\ndamage you can cause is much smaller than when it&#39;s yelled from the<br/>\nrooftops. <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\n<br/>\n- darcy</div>",

            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1856407591\">Hi Doug, <br/>\n <br/>\nI don&#39;t think the blade is overpriced.............. it is a rare work by<br/>\na highly rated smith with Tok. Hozon papers. Granted he is not giving it<br/>\naway, but the big &quot;name&quot; dealers would certainly not charge less than<br/>\nthis in my opinion (infact probably at least a couple of thousand<br/>\nmore..............), and it has provenance (where the seller purchased<br/>\nit). It is not one of those &quot;finds&quot; which usually turn out to be alot<br/>\nless grand than stated by the seller. <br/>\n <br/>\nAnyway it doesn&#39;t make much difference to me as I can&#39;t afford it at the<br/>\nmoment, but if I could I would seriously consider it. I believe Robert<br/>\nreferred to this blade earlier as having an &quot;etched&quot; design ? No such<br/>\nthing, this is a genuine piece of art. Not some piece of Chinese<br/>\nrubbish. <br/>\n <br/>\nAnd ofcourse anything koto Soshu den is going to cost you an arm and a<br/>\nleg. There seem to be more collectors in that area, generally driving<br/>\nprices up. <br/>\n <br/>\nWell I believe I have said enough now considering I still know nothing<br/>\nin the big scheme of things hahahahahah. Anyone who wants to put their<br/>\nfoot in my mouth, feel most welcome. <br/>\n <br/>\nMatt <br/>\n<br/>\n-----Oorspronkelijk bericht-----<br/>\nVan: Doug E.
