I am of the opinion that Shoami<br/>\nartisans were not productive there.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are certainly pieces that have papered to just Mito.<br/>\nBut none that I know of to Mito Shoami,<br/>\nin which case the basic premise is incorrect.<br/>\n<br/>\nJim,<br/>\nThe book you are referring to I presume is titled:<br/>\nTetsu no Isho - Mito-To to Tosogu no Meihin (1996).<br/>\nIbaraki Prefectural Historical Museum.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn section II - Mito Kinko no Tosogu,<br/>\nThe introductory text records prominent individuals<br/>\nand groups that were active in Mito (Hitachi province).<br/>\nAmong them:<br/>\nGunji Yogoro<br/>\nYatabe Tsuji<br/>\nSeiryuken Ha<br/>\nIchiryu (Hitotsuyanagi) Ha<br/>\nTamagawa Ha<br/>\nUchikoshi Ha<br/>\nYasuchika Ha (from the 4th gen. Yasuchika)<br/>\nSaotome and Myochin.<br/>\nAnd of course, Hagiya Shohei (Katsuhira) and Unno Shomin.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNO mention of Shoami in Mito.<br/>\n<br/>\nChecking Haynes- Tsuba, An Aesthetic Study.<br/>\nUnder the section dealing with SHOAMI he mentions:<br/>\nKyo Shoami, Awa Shoami, Bizen Shoami, Iyo Shoami,<br/>\nAizu Shoami, Shonai Shoami, Akita Shoami,<br/>\nBushu (Edo) Shoami & Sakushu (Mimasaka) Shoami.<br/>\nIn addition he adds individuals who signed:<br/>\nOshu Shoami, Soshu (Odawara) Shoami, Seishu (Ise) Shoami,<br/>\nOsaka (Settsu) Shoami, Banshu (Harima) Shoami,<br/>\nInshu (Inaba) Shoami & Kurume (Chikugo) Shoami.<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain NO mention of Mito Shoami.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have never liked the term Mito Shoami<br/>\nand have never used it. This thread presented<br/>\nan opportunity to research the issue<br/>\nto see if my opinion had any basis.<br/>\n<br/>\nCan anyone document a piece that has been<br/>\nauthoritatively classified as Mito Shoami<br/>\nor have we been perpetuating a fallacy?<br/>\n<br/>\nCary Condell<br/>\n<br/>\nCondell & Co., Ltd.<br/>\nP.O.

While not always to my personal taste, <br/>\n&gt; there were a number of Mito lines producing very high quality fittings.  <br/>\n&gt; Several of these Mito lineage founders were students of leading kinko <br/>\n&gt; artists.  No doubt the Mito Tokugawa branch family (with 350,000 koku <br/>\n&gt; revenue) and their retainers were responsible for supporting these many <br/>\n&gt; skilled workers.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The standardized plates, designs taken from copy books, large scale <br/>\n&gt; production and relatively poor quality are characteristics of the Mito <br/>\n&gt; Shoami.  Aizu Shoami workers did a lot of the same.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; There are some rather poor quality, unsigned Mito tsuba as well.  It&#39;s <br/>\n&gt; probably possible to find a group of better than average Mito Shoami <br/>\n&gt; work that exceeds the quality of the bottom of Mito production.  These <br/>\n&gt; lesser pieces are probably the source of the confusion between Mito and <br/>\n&gt; Mito Shoami.  I have seen some fairly insipid mumei tsuba with kanteisho <br/>\n&gt; to Mito.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s true that better Mito workers did copy Nara, Hamano and others, but <br/>\n&gt; their copy work is nothing like the Mito Shoami stuff after the Nara <br/>\n&gt; style.  If anything the workmanship of the Mito copies is a bit over the <br/>\n&gt; top compared with the originals.  It&#39;s also usually signed by the maker.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; There was a book on published 5-10 years ago on Mito swords and tosogu.  <br/>\n&gt; Mine is out on loan and I don&#39;t remember the title or author&#39;s name.  <br/>\n&gt; Does anyone have one handy?  In any event, that&#39;s a good book to look <br/>\n&gt; through to get a feel for the better Mito work.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Jim<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   Rich,<br/>\n&gt;   I think you are mistaken in your appraisal of Mito work, the Mito Shoami<br/>\n&gt;   never achieved much prominence but the Mito Kinko are among the best <br/>\n&gt; artists<br/>\n&gt;   who ever made fittings, particularly in the late Edo/Meiji periods with<br/>\n&gt;   artists like Hagiya Katsuhei and Unno Shomin. They were also very able<br/>\n&gt;   copyists, I remember Mr Ono some years ago showed me a well known Somin<br/>\n&gt;   kozuka of a horse (seen from the rear) in takazogan, I asked him how <br/>\n&gt; to tell<br/>\n&gt;   the real thing from a Mito copy, he said the only difference was that <br/>\n&gt; in the<br/>\n&gt;   copy the horse stood more proud, or was it the other way around?<br/>\n&gt;   Alan<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>",
