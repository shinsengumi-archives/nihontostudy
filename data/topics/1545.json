Another would be to carry grandad&#39;s Sue-Bizen 2 shaku <br/>\nuchigatana in a koshirae that was more appropriate for Edo period <br/>\nofficial functions(necessity).

Perhaps <br/>\nit is the only sword in a very poor house, so the best koshirae they <br/>\ncould afford was put on the best sword they had...

That would be a 100<br/>\npoint koshirae.<br/>\n<br/>\nEach deviation from that state has a corresponding point reduction.<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree with Gordon&#39;s comments about preservation standards and practices in<br/>\nJapan and I believe that foreign collectors should understand and apply<br/>\nthese standards to their own practice.  This approach tends to keep the<br/>\ndimensions I outlined above in balance.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnfortunately, a lot of koshirae submitted to the overseas shinsa have these<br/>\ndimensions knocked out of balance due to overzealous restoration,<br/>\nreplacement or outright fabrication.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere isn&#39;t a formula for this, so I will provide some anecdotes that I<br/>\nthink will get the general idea across.<br/>\n<br/>\n- The biggest upsets seem to result from newly built koshirae.  An owner<br/>\nwill collect a group of old fittings, sometimes of very nice quality, and<br/>\nhave a koshirae made up with a new saya and tsuka foundation.  This will not<br/>\npass shinsa and the owner will be unhappy, particularly when he sees<br/>\noriginal koshirae with fittings that are not nearly as nice as his pass with<br/>\nabove average point values. <br/>\n<br/>\n- These other koshirae can have very plain fittings that on their own would<br/>\nnot even be seen as being collectible by most.  However, when they are all<br/>\noriginal and in good condition they can do quite well as a koshirae, often<br/>\nto the surprise of their owners who thought the mount was nothing special<br/>\nbecause the fittings weren&#39;t fancy.<br/>\n<br/>\n- An otherwise original, good looking koshirae with a newly made saya will<br/>\nfail.<br/>\n<br/>\n- An original koshirae with a refinished old saya will suffer a major point<br/>\nreduction.  If the mount is otherwise fairly good and well preserved, the<br/>\nrefinished saya will probably drive it into the shinteisho point range<br/>\n(60-69).  If the mount is not so good, the saya can drive it below 60 points<br/>\nwhich translates to failing shinsa.  An &quot;auto body&quot; job on a saya will<br/>\nalmost certainly drag any koshirae below 60 points.<br/>\n<br/>\n- A slightly damaged but original saya will suffer a point reduction, but<br/>\nprobably not as big a one as a new or badly restored one will.  Too much<br/>\ndamage can pull the piece into the shinteisho or failing range.<br/>\n<br/>\n- A new tsuka foundation, while less obvious than a new saya, will fail.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Same that is obviously new will result in a major point reduction, but in<br/>\npractice is usually accompanied by enough additional poor &quot;restoration&quot; to<br/>\nresult in failure.<br/>\n<br/>\n- It is a plus to keep old tsuka ito (mid Edo or older) intact, even if it<br/>\nis damaged or dirty.  Clumsy recent tsuka ito work will result in a<br/>\nsignificant point reduction.  Good quality recent tsuka ito work is a lesser<br/>\nreduction.  I personally believe that destroying an older wrap is a very bad<br/>\npractice, but at shinsa there is no way to know what was removed before the<br/>\nnew wrap was applied.  A koshirae that should have tsuka ito but does not<br/>\nhave it will usually fail.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Missing kurikata, koiguchi, etc. will result in a point reduction.  Badly<br/>\nrestored kurikata, koiguchi, etc., will also result in a point reduction.<br/>\nOnes restored to professional Japanese standards are generally overlooked.<br/>\n<br/>\n- A missing kozuka or kogai where there should be one will result in a point<br/>\nreduction, as will one inappropriate to the koshirae.  A gimei kozuka or<br/>\nkogai will result in failure of the koshirae, although it is usually<br/>\npossible to certify the koshirae excluding that fitting.  <br/>\n<br/>\n- A koshirae with gimei or reproduction tsuba, menuki,  fuchigashira or any<br/>\nfitting that cannot be excluded will fail.<br/>\n<br/>\n- An original sageo is a slight plus.  A missing or modern one is ignored.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Missing seppa tend to be overlooked, but ill-fitting western ones are<br/>\nworse than none. <br/>\n<br/>\n- In general minor repairs done to high quality Japanese standards will be<br/>\noverlooked, but ones done poorly and/or in non-Japanese standards will be<br/>\ndowngraded.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Put-together koshirae from old saya and tsuka will fail if detected...<br/>\nand they are detected.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Restoration work that is good enough to escape detection will escape<br/>\ndetection.<br/>\n<br/>\nJim<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Jim, care to comment?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Gordon<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYahoo!

That would<br/>\nbe a 100 point koshirae.<br/>\n<br/>\nEach deviation from that state has a corresponding point reduction.<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree with Gordon&#39;s comments about preservation standards and<br/>\npractices in Japan and I believe that foreign collectors should<br/>\nunderstand and apply these standards to their own practice.  This<br/>\napproach tends to keep the dimensions I outlined above in balance.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnfortunately, a lot of koshirae submitted to the overseas shinsa have<br/>\nthese dimensions knocked out of balance due to overzealous restoration,<br/>\nreplacement or outright fabrication.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere isn&#39;t a formula for this, so I will provide some anecdotes that I<br/>\nthink will get the general idea across.<br/>\n<br/>\n- The biggest upsets seem to result from newly built koshirae.  An owner<br/>\nwill collect a group of old fittings, sometimes of very nice quality,<br/>\nand have a koshirae made up with a new saya and tsuka foundation.  This<br/>\nwill not pass shinsa and the owner will be unhappy, particularly when he<br/>\nsees original koshirae with fittings that are not nearly as nice as his<br/>\npass with above average point values. <br/>\n<br/>\n- These other koshirae can have very plain fittings that on their own<br/>\nwould not even be seen as being collectible by most.  However, when they<br/>\nare all original and in good condition they can do quite well as a<br/>\nkoshirae, often to the surprise of their owners who thought the mount<br/>\nwas nothing special because the fittings weren&#39;t fancy.<br/>\n<br/>\n- An otherwise original, good looking koshirae with a newly made saya<br/>\nwill fail.<br/>\n<br/>\n- An original koshirae with a refinished old saya will suffer a major<br/>\npoint reduction.  If the mount is otherwise fairly good and well<br/>\npreserved, the refinished saya will probably drive it into the<br/>\nshinteisho point range (60-69).  If the mount is not so good, the saya<br/>\ncan drive it below 60 points which translates to failing shinsa.  An<br/>\n&quot;auto body&quot; job on a saya will almost certainly drag any koshirae below<br/>\n60 points.<br/>\n<br/>\n- A slightly damaged but original saya will suffer a point reduction,<br/>\nbut probably not as big a one as a new or badly restored one will.  Too<br/>\nmuch damage can pull the piece into the shinteisho or failing range.<br/>\n<br/>\n- A new tsuka foundation, while less obvious than a new saya, will fail.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Same that is obviously new will result in a major point reduction, but<br/>\nin practice is usually accompanied by enough additional poor<br/>\n&quot;restoration&quot; to result in failure.<br/>\n<br/>\n- It is a plus to keep old tsuka ito (mid Edo or older) intact, even if<br/>\nit is damaged or dirty.  Clumsy recent tsuka ito work will result in a<br/>\nsignificant point reduction.  Good quality recent tsuka ito work is a<br/>\nlesser reduction.  I personally believe that destroying an older wrap is<br/>\na very bad practice, but at shinsa there is no way to know what was<br/>\nremoved before the new wrap was applied.  A koshirae that should have<br/>\ntsuka ito but does not have it will usually fail.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Missing kurikata, koiguchi, etc. will result in a point reduction.<br/>\nBadly restored kurikata, koiguchi, etc., will also result in a point<br/>\nreduction.  Ones restored to professional Japanese standards are<br/>\ngenerally overlooked.<br/>\n<br/>\n- A missing kozuka or kogai where there should be one will result in a<br/>\npoint reduction, as will one inappropriate to the koshirae.  A gimei<br/>\nkozuka or kogai will result in failure of the koshirae, although it is<br/>\nusually possible to certify the koshirae excluding that fitting.  <br/>\n<br/>\n- A koshirae with gimei or reproduction tsuba, menuki,  fuchigashira or<br/>\nany fitting that cannot be excluded will fail.<br/>\n<br/>\n- An original sageo is a slight plus.  A missing or modern one is<br/>\nignored.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Missing seppa tend to be overlooked, but ill-fitting western ones are<br/>\nworse than none. <br/>\n<br/>\n- In general minor repairs done to high quality Japanese standards will<br/>\nbe overlooked, but ones done poorly and/or in non-Japanese standards<br/>\nwill be downgraded.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Put-together koshirae from old saya and tsuka will fail if detected...<br/>\nand they are detected.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Restoration work that is good enough to escape detection will escape<br/>\ndetection.<br/>\n<br/>\nJim<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Jim, care to comment?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Gordon<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYahoo!
