If I understood correctly all iron  <br/>\ntosho style tsuba appropriately enough. I would love to see one in  <br/>\nperson myself.<br/>\n\t\tYour page says; This is a Tosho tsuba with kokuin impressed in a  <br/>\ntsuchime-ji by Suishinshi Masahide. Masahides&#39; great contribution to  <br/>\nthe world of the Japanese sword is evidenced by one well known fact,  <br/>\nand that is that the Shinshinto era begins with the emergence of this  <br/>\nvery artist. His strength, his energy are evidenced by his having  <br/>\nanswered the demands of the times all the while fostering over 100  <br/>\nstudents. He was an extraordinary educator.<br/>\n\tIn Token Benkyo Kai first place is Ten (Heaven), second place is Chi  <br/>\n(Earth) and third place is &quot;Jin&quot; (Man). With this work Masahide makes  <br/>\nreference to that as well as Buddhistic themes. It is thought with  <br/>\nthis tsuba Masahide is showing us a miniature universe, his kokuin  <br/>\nreading &quot;Niten&quot; is an abbreviation of Nitenji, a guardian deity who  <br/>\nis the same as Nichirin (the orb of heaven, the sun).<br/>\n\tIn Bunsei Gannen Masahide changed his name to Amahide, one story has  <br/>\nit that the &quot;Ama&quot; was granted to him by lord Akimoto, suggesting a  <br/>\nlink to the first great swordsmith Amakuni and &quot;lord of swordmakers  <br/>\nheaven.&quot;<br/>\n\tThe metal is a bit on the hard side but the color and texture are  <br/>\nexcellent, this is a rare and well known piece.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAt least that is what I think it says...<br/>\n-t</div>",

Is this section signed ?, the blade ( called dos <br/>\n  Kogatana ) is signed, but is too small and obscured to read. You should <br/>\n  find that, after wrapping the blade in some cloth like cotton or <br/>\n  something ( in case the kogatana is sharp ) you can pull the blade <br/>\n  straight out of the handle. Once out, you can photograph the whole blade <br/>\n  cleanly and see all the mei.
