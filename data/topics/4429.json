Practically straight out of the<br/>\nSatsuma koshirae book.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe tsuba didn&#39;t knock my socks off, but was a good<br/>\ntsuba a bit afield from what I collect. Interesting<br/>\npiece.<br/>\n   I realized then that either I have overlooked any<br/>\nnicer Satsuma tsuba on the market, or maybe they<br/>\nsimply don&#39;t come to market that often? Anyone able to<br/>\npoint me at some Satsuma tsuba in Japan or give me a<br/>\nfair ballpark what sort of value they carry in Japan?<br/>\nI&#39;d love to see other examples, if anyone has photos.<br/>\nI haven&#39;t much looked for them before, but now am a<br/>\nlittle more curious to learn about them.<br/>\n<br/>\nCurran<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTired of spam?
