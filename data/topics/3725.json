They cannot be produced on purpose, are rare, and are seen<br/>\nwith satisfaction.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nMy impression is that Lyman is mistaken, and that this feature can be<br/>\nproduced deliberately.  Is that correct?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd are tobiyaki really regarded as especially rare and an unusual sign of<br/>\nquality?</div>",
