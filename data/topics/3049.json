I&#39;m hesitant to conclude that none of the<br/>\nHolland reprints have the chart, so if anyone who has a copy of this<br/>\nbook could check for the fold out Nengo chart and let me know what you<br/>\nfind, my bibliographic curiosity will be satisfied. Holland reprinted<br/>\nit several times starting in 1963, so tell me which printing you have,<br/>\nand if there is or is not a Nengo chart. If you happen to have a copy<br/>\nof the Tuttle reprint other than the 1963 - I&#39;m not sure they printed<br/>\nit more than once - and let me know the same information, I&#39;d<br/>\nappreciate it.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease mail me directly at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bridgeofdreams@...\">bridgeofdreams@...</a>, no need to reply<br/>\nto the list(s). I&#39;ll summarize the information for all.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\n<br/>\nCraig<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nCraig Harris<br/>\nBooks from and about Asia<br/>\nwww.bridgeofdreams.com</div>",
