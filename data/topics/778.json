It looks a bit better than the so-called &quot;Mito-Shoami&quot; shiiremono, but is probably in that bag.  I have followed up on that and I agree with Cary that there is no proof of the existence of a Mito Shoami group.  It was a handy label for the auction business, but I think we should avoid it going forward.  I still think that those guards probably do have an association with the Shoami because of the similarity of some of them to signed pieces like this one:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://tinyurl.com/ng6e\">http://tinyurl.com/ng6e</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://tinyurl.com/ng6h\">http://tinyurl.com/ng6h</a><br/>\n<br/>\nJim<br/>\n  -<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Gang,<br/>\n  talking about water buffalo..............here&#39;s a tsuba with water <br/>\n  buffalo <br/>\n  klick..........<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://tinyurl.com/ncvk\">http://tinyurl.com/ncvk</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  question...... what schoo ?<br/>\n  1.
