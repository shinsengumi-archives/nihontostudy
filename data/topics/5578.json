The famous set of Asuka period bronze statues of<br/>\n  Yakushi nyorai and Gakko and Nikko at Yakushi-ji in Nara have an early<br/>\n  example of the grape motif on the base of the Yakushi nyorai statue, so we<br/>\n  are talking middle 500s or so. Squirrels may be included in the motif, but I<br/>\n  can&#39;t recall right off hand. Thus, there is a definite Buddhist connection.<br/>\n  The motif shows up in sword fittings rather early and I believe there are<br/>\n  pieces by Joshin or at least around that time with the motif. Ko-Kinko<br/>\n  workers produced it, and there are also some Ko-Mino examples, if memory<br/>\n  serves. As you move into the Edo period, it seems to me that the motif was<br/>\n  not as popular. Certainly from the mid to late Edo period you do not see it<br/>\n  very much. If I can remember, I will see what some of my other sources have<br/>\n  to say. I did see your earlier message about this, but just didn&#39;t jump at<br/>\n  it.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Sorry we will miss you in SF, but we can catch up at the Daitoken-ishi.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Gordon<br/>\n<br/>\n  _____ <br/>\n<br/>\n  From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com\">nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com\">nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com</a>] On<br/>\n  Behalf Of Ron Hartmann<br/>\n  Sent: Thursday, July 09, 2009 10:28 AM<br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com\">nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n  Subject: Re: [nihontostudy] Fw: Sword term meaning...<br/>\n<br/>\n  Thanks for the reply, Gordon.

            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-754416365\">Hi Ron,<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nThe method of attaching menuki to the handle went from the male-female posts<br/>\nor inyôkon that passed through the handle and the nakago fastening the<br/>\nmenuki to each other to chikara-gane. These inyôkon posts continued until<br/>\nthe late Muromachi period into the Momoyama period. They are also seen on<br/>\ngenerally high class works for the mid to late Edo period; however, they no<br/>\nlonger went all the way through the tsuka and basically worked as the newer<br/>\nchikara-gane do. As noted, strength and metal is the literal translation,<br/>\nbut more accurately I would call them reinforced/strengthened tabs of<br/>\ntypically copper. On an added note, at least the first three generations of<br/>\nthe main line Goto masters are said to have only used inyôkon posts and<br/>\nmenuki without them will typically be attributed to Ko-Goto rather than one<br/>\nof the main guys. I expect we will be catching up with many on the list in<br/>\nSan Francisco next month. I am certainly looking forward to it.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nGordon<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n  _____  <br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com\">nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com\">nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com</a>] On<br/>\nBehalf Of Ron Hartmann<br/>\nSent: Thursday, July 09, 2009 3:28 AM<br/>\nTo: TOKEN; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nihonto@yahoogroups.com\">nihonto@yahoogroups.com</a>; nihontostudy<br/>\nSubject: [nihontostudy] Fw: Sword term meaning...<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOkay, I jumped too soon on this question.
