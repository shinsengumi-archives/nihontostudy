You can patch the page into the altavista link <br/>\nfor a &#39;translation&#39; although we all know how Japanese to English <br/>\ntranslates by now.  On the left side of the page there are a series <br/>\nof lectures which have many examples to see, both sword and <br/>\nfittings.  Lecture three has several Ezo examples.<br/>\n<br/>\nOK Alan, here is a further quote from Buttweiler;<br/>\n<br/>\n     &#39;The surface of Ezo Menuki were originally covered by a thick <br/>\nlayer of Gold applied as an amalgam.  The Gold was burnished with a <br/>\nrather large needle which left well defined polishing marks.  The <br/>\nGold used for the overlay was of very low karat.  The resulting color <br/>\nis a very pale Silver-Golden hue.  The Gold will frequently be worn <br/>\nfrom the high spots leaving a black Shakudo-like patina&#39;.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a feeling that much of what we see tody are the remnants of <br/>\nfield worn gear.  This might explain the relatively poor condition of <br/>\nmany of these very early fittings.  Fine pieces for the commanders or <br/>\nDaimyo were passed on as family treasures or left to shrines.  The <br/>\nvast majority of the rest were simply lost to battle or to time.</div>",
