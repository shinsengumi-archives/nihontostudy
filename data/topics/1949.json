From the description it would seem to be in WWII mounts with a leather<br/>\ncombat cover, though it may have a partly civilian tsuka. My client is a<br/>\nknowledgeable collector, but this is his first nihonto. He has ordered<br/>\nseveral books and seems interested in knowing more, at least about this one<br/>\nsword.<br/>\n <br/>\nHe was able to get the mekugi out but has not had the handle off, so we&#39;re<br/>\nnot sure if it&#39;s a bar-stock blade or the family Koto heirloom.<br/>\n <br/>\nI&#39;m sure I&#39;ve met someone from Tucson at one of the shows, but a look<br/>\nthrough my card file drew a blank. Anyone in the area willing to help out,<br/>\nplease get in touch with me directly with your contact info at<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:craigharris@...\">craigharris@...</a> and I&#39;ll pass your info on to him.<br/>\n <br/>\nDON&#39;T hit that reply button.<br/>\n <br/>\nThanks!<br/>\n <br/>\nCraig L.
