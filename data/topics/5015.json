            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1548110974\">To All,<br/>\n<br/>\nFor anyone who is serious about appreciating and studying Japanese swords, <br/>\nfittings and weaponry, going to Japan and visiting some of the finest <br/>\nmuseums, castles, sword stores and the annual Dai-Token-Ichi are an absolute <br/>\nMUST. Attached is the itinerary for the upcoming tour from October 16th to <br/>\nOctober 27th.  It is only 5 months from now so now is a good time to do some <br/>\nadvance planning. All things considered, the cost of the trip is a modest <br/>\ninvestment as you will learn, see and experience so much. If you confine <br/>\nyourselves to sword shows and museums in the USA, you will NEVER advance <br/>\nyour knowledge. I organize and conduct the one and only comprehensive and <br/>\nfocused Japanese swords, fittings and weaponry tour.<br/>\nThanks for reading,<br/>\n<br/>\nFred<br/>\nSwordSmith Secrets<br/>\nEmail: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:swordsmithsecret@...\">swordsmithsecret@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nMore photos, more messages, more storageï¿½get 2GB with Windows Live Hotmail. <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://imagine-windowslive.com/hotmail/?locale=en-us&ocid=TXT_TAGHM_migration_HM_mini_2G_0507\">http://imagine-windowslive.com/hotmail/?locale=en-us&ocid=TXT_TAGHM_migration_HM_mini_2G_0507</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
