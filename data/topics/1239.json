            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1825760968\">Good point Jim, that would be fascinating to find out. I do know that<br/>\nthe swords were nearly all exported to the Chinese Court and the<br/>\naristocracy, and they (the Chinese upper class, especially the Emperor)<br/>\nhad a kind of tendency to &quot;embelish&quot; items of great value. The 18th cent<br/>\nQianlong emperor for example had his own poems engraved onto priceless<br/>\n12th cent Song Dynasty works or art that were handed down through the<br/>\ngenerations. I could quite well imagine them replacing a Japanese tsuba<br/>\non a Japanese sword with one of their own if they thought it was an<br/>\nimprovement. <br/>\n <br/>\nMy guess would be that the swords were exported with koshirae, but I<br/>\nwould love to know for sure how this exactly went down. Another<br/>\ninteresting point is that in 12 years I have never ever seen a Japanese<br/>\nsword found at the Imperial Chinese court. Since so many of them were<br/>\nexported all those years ago, you would think there must still be one or<br/>\ntwo lying around.
