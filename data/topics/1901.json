            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-25113647\">At present you can find a Kiyosada japanese Sword with NBTHK papers <br/>\nfor sale on ebay. I bought this sword the 21th. of february 2004, <br/>\npayed it but never received it. By request I received several other <br/>\nphotos of the sword and the NBTHK papers as well as copies from his <br/>\npassport and driverslicense. This information is avaible for the <br/>\nlist if you don´t find it inconvenient. Look well at this sword on <br/>\nebay and take care of wolflady 137 and jnetweb as well as John <br/>\nPivec, Minneapolis, USA. This sword will without any doubt be put <br/>\nfor sale again. If anyone has this sword in their possession, please <br/>\nlet me know. I will award informations which will place the sword at <br/>\nmy house with 1000 U.S.dollars. If the Nihonto study group find it <br/>\nappropiate I will put photos of the sword as well as John Pivecs <br/>\npassport and driverslicense, on the list. <br/>\nThe Danish Criminal Police, The Danish Foreign Ministry and the USA <br/>\nPolice are involved in the investigation and I have asked ebay to <br/>\nhelp with information as well.<br/>\nThankyou for your help in advance<br/>\nAll the best<br/>\nAllan</div>",
