You and other will be pleased to know that the very useful sword literature index that Gray Doffin put together a number of years ago has been updated and is now available for everyone&#39;s use by going to jssus.org and clicking on the SLI link. This is now a searchable index and (if memory serves correctly) has been added to the JSS/US web site as a public service.

I just renewed for 2009.  For those who don&#39;t currently belong, I would urge you to strongly consider springing for a membership.  It is well worth the reasonable dues.  Calls &#39;em as I sees &#39;em.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Best Regards,<br/>\n  Gary Gabelhouse<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>",
