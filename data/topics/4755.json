            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1424949831\">It was my impression that menuki assigned to Ezo were not only made with a thin plate but also they had a unique method of -- and I&#39;m not sure of the correct terminology here -- gilding on them, something similar to found in Chinese artworks. A year or so ago I wrote an article for the JSS/US to illustrate some menuki depicting the mythical &quot;baku.&quot; The one set of menuki were fairly large sized as one might expect in Ezo but the other set were what I&#39;d call &quot;normal&quot; menuki size, but they also had all the other characteristics of Ezo. To me, it seemed somewhat unusual to find the &quot;baku&quot; creature depicted on menuki thought to be Ezo. Earlier, I did show these to both Jim Gilbert and Bob Haynes and they agreed that they appeared to be Ezo works. But really, I wonder who knows; Buttweiler&#39;s writings on Ezo are about all I&#39;ve ever really found regarding Ezo, at least what comes to mind tonight. <br/>\n<br/>\nHere now is a nice Echizen Kanenori katana that was found in nice quality WWII gunto mounting. What&#39;s kind of unique is that the tsuka has menuki depicting a fairly large &quot;tiger&quot; which -- judging while held in place under wrapping -- really does have the look of possibly being Ezo. The &quot;worn gold gilding&quot; is there, the size is right, but I wonder. I&#39;d love to remove these but find it difficult to bring myself to unwrap this tsuka in order to &quot;get them into my hand.&quot; (The wrap is already broken, but remains almost all there and intact.) Now I would think it unusual, as with the &quot;baku,&quot; to find Ezo menuki depicting a running &quot;tiger.&quot; It is a temptation to have a look at these, for sure! If these are no Ezo, I wonder where they should be placed? <br/>\n<br/>\nRon<br/>\nSTL<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Alan Bale <br/>\n  To: Study Group <br/>\n  Sent: Monday, December 11, 2006 6:25 AM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [nihontostudy] Aizu / Shoki Kinko Menuki<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  I don&#39;t think there is any real connection between Ezo and Ko-Mino menuki, Ezo menuki are generally larger and with a less detailed design (large cherry blossom etc), I wonder if those smaller Ezo menuki with a detailed design are Ezo at all.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Alan<br/>\n<br/>\n  ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: klepet33319 <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com\">nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Sunday, December 10, 2006 5:23 PM<br/>\n  Subject: [nihontostudy] Aizu / Shoki Kinko Menuki<br/>\n<br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://page10.auctions.yahoo.co.jp/jp/auction/m35952378\">http://page10.auctions.yahoo.co.jp/jp/auction/m35952378</a><br/>\n<br/>\n  Can anyone elaborate on where these fit in historically?
