            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-875811552\">Hello everyone, new member here. My name is Mike and I was <br/>\nrecently offered a couple japanese swords. I have been collecting <br/>\nswords for the past 10 years or so, but primarily European. The one <br/>\nis a WWII officer&#39;s with a mei on the blade of Ando Kanemoto. It is <br/>\nin beautiful shape and I did not see any faults with it at all. <br/>\n   The other one has me a bit confused which is one reason I joined <br/>\nthe group. The blade is unsigned, but the tsuba does have a <br/>\nsignature. I have asked a lot of people, but no one is able to give <br/>\nme a definate answer as to what it is. I assume the 2 sets of <br/>\ncharacters is that of the smith and the school, but I don&#39;t know for <br/>\nsure. Pictures of the tsuba and the tsuka can be found in the folder <br/>\nI created at:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://ph.groups.yahoo.com/group/nihontostudy/photos/browse/9ea7?c=\">http://ph.groups.yahoo.com/group/nihontostudy/photos/browse/9ea7?c=</a><br/>\n<br/>\nLike I hinted at, I am quite new to Japanese weaponry, and <br/>\ntranslating kanji is certainly wayyyy out of my field. What I have <br/>\nbeen able to come up with on the tsuba could be a few things. First, <br/>\nthe 2 charcters on the left (I don&#39;t know if everyone has the kanji <br/>\nfont on their computers but I will put it here anyways).<br/>\n<br/>\nI see p for sure which I believe is either &quot;teru&quot; or &quot;hide&quot; the 2nd <br/>\ncharacter I have not determined for sure.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the right side, I see either ³ (tatsu) or possibly `ê (taki) <br/>\nfollowed by, I believe ä (don&#39;t know the pronounciation) and then q <br/>\n(shi).<br/>\n<br/>\nObviously, what I want to know is who this tsuba is made by and the <br/>\nschool it is from. But also a potential date. I was informed by the <br/>\nowner of the sword that it was authenticated by a friend of mine and <br/>\nhe thought it to be from the late 1600s or 1700s, but that is <br/>\ncertainly unclear.<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you all in advance for your help. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike</div>",
