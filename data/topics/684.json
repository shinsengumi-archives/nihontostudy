            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-515766989\">Gentle-readers and poor souls,<br/>\n\tI say poor souls because I know how pitiable one feels when <br/>\nhe cannot get to the show. This was my first show in like five years <br/>\nand I enjoyed every minute. From Thursday night check in to last <br/>\nminute haggle on Sunday.<br/>\n\tFrom this list I met Curran, Darcy and Rick for the first <br/>\ntime, and I became reacquainted with others like Ron Hartman etc...I <br/>\nknew and remembered most everyone there, so spent a great many <br/>\npleasant hours just getting caught up. In the past I was just the new <br/>\nkid or one more face in the crowd. Now that they had all seen my face <br/>\n&quot;in the paper&quot; as it were I met many more people who expressed <br/>\ninterest in my articles. Frankly it was very nice to know that <br/>\nsomeone had been reading them, and very kind of everyone to pay the <br/>\ncompliments.<br/>\n\tI try to be scientific in my approach to the showroom but <br/>\ndepending on who I run into it doesn&#39;t always work. On Thursday I <br/>\ncovered the whole room as best I could returning to my table (really <br/>\na friends table), with two t-shirts, 9 DVDs and a mental list of <br/>\ntables and people I would need to revisit.<br/>\n\tAs Dr. Gordon Robson DRE, and Okada Moriyoshi of the NTHK <br/>\nwere in attendance, I naturally did my best to make the distinguished <br/>\nguests from Japan feel at home. Along with Jim Gilbert we had a fine <br/>\nseafood dinner and shared talk of swords, kodogu, the London Shinsa <br/>\nand the possibility of a SFO Shinsa in the future.<br/>\n\tFriday opened early with more of the same, I put some books <br/>\nout which sold quickly and thus had some coin to spend on the items <br/>\non my want list. Replacing books with books is always a danger with <br/>\nme, I spotted a title I had been after and made note of price and <br/>\nlocation. There were some supplies I needed and priced those at <br/>\nseveral tables, while just perusing other things.<br/>\n\tThere wasn&#39;t much armour to be seen but quite a few good <br/>\nswords. Especially right across the front of the room. Cary Condell, <br/>\nMichael Krause, Ralph Bell and Fred Weisberg, Al Bardi, Robert Hughes <br/>\nand Mark Robinson all had fine blades in polish and ready to move. <br/>\nMichael Krause and Robert Hughes had good blades in nice koshirae, <br/>\nRalph and Fred mostly blades in shirasaya. Cary had a monster blade <br/>\nat sanshaku in koshirae and a selection of fine kodogu. As promised <br/>\nhe showed me his Sa Yukihide Tanto, which rather than elicit &quot;wows!&quot; <br/>\ngave me to utter a contented &quot;MMM Good...&quot; It looked and felt solid <br/>\nin every respect.<br/>\n\tFriday I was busy helping set up and monitor the lecture and <br/>\nkansho-kai presented by the NTHK and Dr. Robson. The topic was <br/>\nBizen-den from Muromachi to Shishinto, with Sue-koto Bizen blades <br/>\nmost in evidence. The arc from Late nambokucho to bakumatsu was <br/>\nillustrated clearly by the shapes and workmanship in each. As <br/>\nmentioned the Kozori tachi was a rare treasure in any company, I <br/>\nliked the Kiyomitsu ken as well. I was impressed that proper sword <br/>\netiquette was strictly followed by all, though for the life of me <br/>\ncannot imagine what it was that kept people in line.<br/>\n\tAfterwards back in the showroom the tables had almost filled <br/>\nup, excepting those dealers from the East Coast who got caught in the <br/>\nBlackout. While there were plenty of polished/papered blades <br/>\navailable there seemed to be a distinct lack of piles of junk. There <br/>\nreally weren&#39;t any tables stacked with rusty, chipped and broken <br/>\ndiamonds in the rough, waiting to be spotted by a discerning eye. <br/>\nThis might be explained by the abscence of Mr. Wahlberg, but it seems <br/>\nthat most everyone had just a few choice items to sell. Perhaps the <br/>\nobject was to travel light.<br/>\n\tFriday ended like each night ended with groups of like minded <br/>\nenthusiasts huddled around a warm Sam Adams, discussing the virtues <br/>\nof a Kunimichi katana or the foible of seeing all Shinto works with <br/>\nmitsumune as Hankei blades.<br/>\n\tSaturday skipped breakfast and an initial foray into the <br/>\nshowroom to get in line at the Masamune Jutetsu exhibition. Avoiding <br/>\nthe long line opposite the Masamune, I jumped into the middle of the <br/>\ntable and found myself addressing a Naotsuna katana and then a Sa <br/>\nHiroyasu, then Okanemitsu, then Naoe Shizu, then Yamato Shizu <br/>\nKaneuji. At this point in Japan we would likely be done but there <br/>\nwere thirteen or more blades, all textbook examples of the artist. <br/>\nBetter education for the eye cannot be found, I&#39;m thinking. That <br/>\nMasamune was so popular that it was the one blade I didn&#39;t get to <br/>\nsee, by all accounts it or the first Norishige was the best blade on <br/>\nthe table. For me the Norishige was the best blade I saw all weekend.<br/>\n\tBack up on the sales floor, more books and supplies. Made the <br/>\nrounds with some iai friends looking for acquisitions. There was no <br/>\nauction but we did have a special presentation at dinner. As part of <br/>\nthe preparation for the show we polled local politicians for letters <br/>\nof support. We received letters from many club members, the Consulate <br/>\nGeneral of Japan, the Mayor of Burlingame and the Mayor of San <br/>\nFrancisco. In an only in San Francisco twist, it seems the office of <br/>\nMayor Willie Brown misunderstood just exactly what we were after. <br/>\nInstead of a letter of support we received something better! A <br/>\nproclamation from the Mayor making Saturday August 16th DR.GORDON <br/>\nROBSON DAY!! Our very own holiday celebrated with a pair of <br/>\nsuspenders, a pint of beer and a good cigar.<br/>\n\tSunday, with tables closing down here and there the last <br/>\nminute wheeling and dealing began. I got a deal on some good books I <br/>\nhad been eyeing all weekend, and bought a tanto just because the <br/>\nkoshirae caught my fancy. Hataya Sensei was there along with Ando <br/>\nSan. While Hataya didn&#39;t seem to leave with but a small armful, Ando <br/>\nsan had to buy an extra guncase at the end to carry his purchases.<br/>\n\tBTW I met the Ebay Monk he paid his daughter to wear kimono <br/>\nand man his table. She generated a good deal of interest but it seems <br/>\nhe sold nothing. He may be reading this list because he brought <br/>\nseveral daisho sets, and asked me &quot;aren&#39;t daisho popular with <br/>\nAmericans?&quot;<br/>\n\tAs always there were lots of things I wish I had the coin to <br/>\npurchase and too many people I wish I had more time to sit down and <br/>\nchat with. Overall the rumblings were that prices were high and sales <br/>\nwere slow but it was a successful show. If you are reading this and <br/>\nnot remembering it, then start making your plans for next year, these <br/>\nshows are only getting better year after year.<br/>\n-t</div>",
