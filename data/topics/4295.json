From my understanding, there is a relationship in <br/>\nthe pre Edo work between Tosho, Katchushi and Myochin that crosses over <br/>\nand can blur the lines of separation for these 3 groups. There is a <br/>\ntheory that the Myochin family was the creator of Katchushi but in <br/>\nreading Torigoye/Haynes they state there is no real evidence for this. <br/>\nThe iron is also stated to be better quality in the Katchushi/Myochin <br/>\ntsuba than in Tosho so maybe here is something in there that the NBTHK <br/>\nsaw that we cannot see in the photo&#39;s ?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe similarities that this guard has with Tosho though are too close for <br/>\nme the fathom the reason it is called Myochin. I think Jim is away in <br/>\nthe swamp again so he may not answer.
