            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-184595418\">All, a recent acquisition is this sukashi tsuba with a Yukiwa no Kasa <br/>\ntheme ( circular snow flakes and a parasol ). There is also a single <br/>\nKaregane ( wild geese ) in there as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe tsuba has an NBTHK Tokubetsu Kicho kanteisho to Kyo Sukashi. But in <br/>\ncloser study, this guard looks very much like Kyo Shoami. The heavier <br/>\nset and general theme and balance are leading me to that conclusion. The <br/>\ntsuba has a rich brown patina and the scan does it little justice. I <br/>\nwould think this from the early to mid Edo period.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s dimensions are 80mm x 78mm x 5.5mm<br/>\n<br/>\nSo my question is, was there cross over between Kyo sukashi and Kyo <br/>\nshoami, I feel there is generally enough to tell the two schools apart <br/>\nbut there is always something new to surprise us I guess. I guess I am <br/>\nasking, does this look typical of Kyo Sukashi ?<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.nihontokanjipages.com/personal/tsuba/kyo-sukashi-winter.jpg\">http://www.nihontokanjipages.com/personal/tsuba/kyo-sukashi-winter.jpg</a><br/>\n<br/>\nBest wishes<br/>\n<br/>\nRichard Turner<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
