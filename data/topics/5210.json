(With no formal exhibit set up in 2007, no catalogue was published this year.) The 2005 catalogue was an excellent publication of high quality. Being our group&#39;s first effort, many of the items exhibited that year by American members did not make it into that year&#39;s catalogue. To remedy this, a &quot;supplement&quot; to the 2005 KTK catalogue was planned, one that would include photographs and descriptions of all the many items exhibited in 2005 but not included in the catalogue. A time consuming undertaking, the supplement has now been completed and is available through LuLu.com for the very reasonable price of $50 plus shipping. Check it out:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.lulu.com/content/1179116\">http://www.lulu.com/content/1179116</a><br/>\n&gt; There has been little information written about our fittings study group, Kokusai Tosogu Kai (KTK), so many of you probably wonder what it is all about. The KTK is a private study group of some 40 members, internationally. The purpose of the KTK is to study tosogu as a small group of serious collectors, and to promote research. The KTK is fortunate to have access to a number of significant collections of tosogu, especially in Japan, thanks to a number of private collector/members. As a means of sharing what is studied and the research that follows, the KTK attempts to produce a high quality catalogue of what is brought to our annual conventions for study. An energetic and expensive undertaking, these catalogues are certainly worthwhile (and reasonably priced) publications for one&#39;s sword library. This newly offered supplement to the 2005 KTK catalogue is definitely a publication not to be missed!<br/>\n&gt; Ron<br/>\n&gt; STL<br/>\n&gt; KTK member, Ron Hartmann, St. Louis<br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>",
