I don&#39;t think that kozuka were intended to be used as weapons.  They were utility knives as you describe.  Many Muromachi period functional katana were mounted without kozuka or kogai.  It&#39;s generally the fancier examples that have a kogai or kogai and kozuka together on the saya (or perhaps it&#39;s only the fancier ones that survived).  A kozuka-only mount was usually found on a wakizashi, and even on utilitarian ones.  I have personally never seen an original katana koshirae mounted with only a kozuka or an illustration of one like that.  Does anyone have an example to show?<br/>\n<br/>\nJim  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  not to beat a topic up, but one of the archival postings think kozuka <br/>\n  [according to Dr. Sato, means the blade,too, only collectors separate <br/>\n  the two] were not normal in the Koto period saya in the field because <br/>\n  it was too small to use as a weapon.  <br/>\n  of course, any knife will cut.  but as a pen knife type blade, to cut <br/>\n  a tooth pick, shave a hang nail, cut off a callous ... kogatanna are <br/>\n  just the right size.  wuld not want to trim my nails with a wakasashi.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Ok, i&#39;ll go back to the research stacks now.<br/>\n<br/>\n  doug e.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
