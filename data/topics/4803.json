Everyone who has joined my tours in the past has<br/>\nthoroughly enjoyed having the opportunity to go treasure hunting at<br/>\nflea markets, sword stores, cutlery stores, antique shops, etc.  You<br/>\nwill go to places where very few Japanese sword enthusiasts in the USA<br/>\nhave ever been to!  At the annual Japan Custom Knife Makers Show,<br/>\nyou will meet skilled knifemakers as well as Japanese bladesmiths who<br/>\nalways attend the event.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow is the ideal time to make your plans for 2007 to travel to<br/>\nJapan where you will see and learn so much to enhance your<br/>\nknowledge of Japanese swordcraft, weaponry and history.<br/>\n<br/>\nEmail me with any questions.  Thanks and happy new year!<br/>\n<br/>\nFred<br/>\nSwordSmith Secrets<br/>\nP.O.
