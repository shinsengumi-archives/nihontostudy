            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1463150620\">Hey guys,<br/>\n<br/>\nthe polarizing material arrived in the mail earlier in the week and I <br/>\nhad a chance to try<br/>\npolarizing the light source this morning.<br/>\n<br/>\nLooking at the screen I found that the glare and direct reflections <br/>\npretty much went<br/>\naway(!) but, surprise! it completely fooled the light metering system of <br/>\nthe G2<br/>\n(I haven&#39;t bothered to post a picture of the result - its pretty black).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I went to  manual and found I gotta get a bigger light (I went to a <br/>\n100 watt halogen bulb<br/>\nfor the following pictures - I didn&#39;t use the second light because I was <br/>\na bit short<br/>\non time this morning).  I re - did the color balance for the final photo <br/>\n(which I shot first),<br/>\n but this next photo (the tsuba with only the circular polarizer on) <br/>\nisn&#39;t quite right (it was<br/>\nshot last and I didn&#39;t redo the white balance after removing the <br/>\npolarizing sheet for the<br/>\nlight source).  You&#39;ll note the pics aren&#39;t up to my usual standard of <br/>\nsharpness either - I<br/>\nthink this is due to me opening up the f-stop (which reduces the depth of<br/>\nfield) and perhaps this camera suffers from the same autofocus errors <br/>\nthat some<br/>\nof the other canon cameras (notably the 10D) have...<br/>\n<br/>\nThat being said, this is a photo of the tsuba with only the circular <br/>\npolarizer on - note<br/>\nall the direct reflections:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://home.teleport.com/~rkg/misc/kagamishi_control_small.JPG\">http://home.teleport.com/~rkg/misc/kagamishi_control_small.JPG</a><br/>\n<br/>\nthis final photo is with the polarizing sheet in place:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://home.teleport.com/~rkg/misc/kagamishi_all_polarized_small.JPG\">http://home.teleport.com/~rkg/misc/kagamishi_all_polarized_small.JPG</a><br/>\n<br/>\nthe first thing to note is that most of those annoying reflections are <br/>\nmostly gone (!)<br/>\nthe second thing to notice is the couple of purplish distortions I think <br/>\nthese can be minimized<br/>\nor eliminated by moving the light further away and/or to a different <br/>\nlocation (just get it further out<br/>\nof the family of angles for the tsuba), or maybe a small gobo or <br/>\nsomething.  I think the white<br/>\nflash at the bottom was due to some  light getting around the polarizing <br/>\nsheet.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI also think its still a little underexposed (again, I was in a hurry,<br/>\nand kind of doinked the exposure/fstop until it looked about right in <br/>\nthe viewscreen...)<br/>\n(it would be really useful if Canon had actually allowed the user to <br/>\ncontrol all the camera&#39;s<br/>\nfeatures remotely with the software they provide).<br/>\n<br/>\nThis can be compared to a pic just using a polarizing filter and careful <br/>\nlight setup (and letting<br/>\nthe camera (which is usually smarter than I am) do the exposure stuff):<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://home.teleport.com/~rkg/photos/tsuba/kagamishi_front_polarized_small.JPG\">http://home.teleport.com/~rkg/photos/tsuba/kagamishi_front_polarized_small.JPG</a><br/>\n<br/>\nand again, the above pic with the circular polarizer set to minimum <br/>\nglare reduction:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://home.teleport.com/~rkg/misc/kagamishi_front_non_polarized_small.JPG\">http://home.teleport.com/~rkg/misc/kagamishi_front_non_polarized_small.JPG</a><br/>\n<br/>\nMy conclusion would be that the use of a circular polarizer to cut glare <br/>\nis a no-brainer,<br/>\nand that it appears that polarizing the source light has promise as <br/>\nwell, though I suspect<br/>\nthe big winner would be for trying to photograph swords, where its <br/>\nalmost impossible<br/>\nnot to get a big bloom of direct reflection off of something.  I&#39;ll <br/>\nprobably try that later<br/>\nthis weekend on my new tanto (its a wicked looking osoraku piece for <br/>\nthose who care...).<br/>\n<br/>\nrkg<br/>\n(Richard George)</div>",
