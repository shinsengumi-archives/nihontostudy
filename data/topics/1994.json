Check Joly&#39;s &quot;Legend in Japanese Art,&quot; page 411.  In brief:<br/>\n <br/>\n&quot;Legendary warrior who is credited with the wholesale slaughter of the Ogres, Demons and Goblins with which mediaeval Japan seems to have been infested.  Raiko was sleeping one day in the autumn of 988 when a beautiful lady appeared to him in a dream.  She held a bow and arrow, and introduced herself as the daughter, Shokwa, of the famous Chinese archer Yoyuki, and said that her father had entrusted her with the secrets of archery, to be transmitted to the most worthy.  She then disappeared, leaving near him the weapons, which he found on awakening.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nJoly goes on to describe his campaigns against various monsters.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is also Minamoto Yoshiie who &quot;in 1096 when his father was very sick, he cured him by frightening away, with three twangs of his bowstring, the oni, cause of his illness.  It is sometimes said that he saved the life of the Emperor in this way.&quot;  No arrow involved in that story, but another possibility.  No doubt there are other stories that could fit. <br/>\n<br/>\nJim<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Lists,<br/>\n<br/>\n  A while back I was helping ID a tsuba for a friend.<br/>\n  The tsuba was large and fairly well done with what<br/>\n  looked like a toothy bat face on one side and either a<br/>\n  bow or an arrow on the other side.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I originally thought the toothy bat face to be a<br/>\n  maedate representation- but I&#39;ve seen it repeated on<br/>\n  tsuba almost always in conjuction with the bow and/or<br/>\n  arrow.
