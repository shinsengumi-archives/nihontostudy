I think <br/>\nwhat happened was that when a lord did Sankin-kotai and he liked to <br/>\nshow off, he would outfit his guys in matching koshirae. Adding some <br/>\nnew innovation or regional specialty would add kick. Done right these <br/>\nstyles would become popular with the residents of Edo and then spread <br/>\nto other provinces. Thus we see Higo style stuff from other places, at <br/>\nthe same time Higo enjoyed a thriving business...<br/>\n-t</div>",

To <br/>\nclarify, I have a certain feeling that I should see or at least <br/>\nexpect to see Hizen blades in Higo koshirae. They seen to fit for <br/>\nsome reason unbeknownst to me. <br/>\nSo is there a school of koshirae that is more suited to say Yamashiro <br/>\nblades, or swords of the Echizen province and things like that or is <br/>\nit more just the taste of the owner. <br/>\n<br/>\nI was thinking that a sword from say Iwami province probably wouldn&#39;t <br/>\nhave Edo koshirae or Higo for that matter as they would be to far <br/>\naway and the owner would select a local or more local artisan unless <br/>\nthey traveled or were of a higher stature and had no budget <br/>\nconstraints. <br/>\n<br/>\nany thoughts on this ?? <br/>\n<br/>\ncheers <br/>\n<br/>\nRich</div>",
