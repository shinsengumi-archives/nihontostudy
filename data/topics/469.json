The tanto is <br/>\nsigned Bishu Osafune Kiyo(mitsu?) and Eiroku jyu ichi (nen?) (?) <br/>\ngatsu hi (1568). Q #1: Is it indeed kazu uchimono? Seems so, given <br/>\nthe Bishu vs. Bizen mei, the date, plus it also has a lot of loose <br/>\nhada and forging ware. Q #2: Any idea as to which Kiyomitsu made <br/>\nit? Q #3: Is it common for kazu uchimono of this area and time to <br/>\nhave loads of utsuri and nijuba/sanjuba as does this example? That <br/>\nis, while the forging was apparently quick and dirty, it appears that <br/>\nthis blade got the full professional tempering treatment. Possibly <br/>\nthe smiths were so used to doing the tempering correctly that they <br/>\njust did it as a matter of course, even for bundled blades? Thanks <br/>\nin advance for any and all input!<br/>\n<br/>\nNC</div>",
