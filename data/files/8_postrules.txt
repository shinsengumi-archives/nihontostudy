Most of this is just common sense and good manners, but since listservs have a way of getting out of control without them, here are the rules for posting to the nihontostudy group:

No profanity or porn.

No personal attacks.  This includes private posts accidentally sent to the list.

No posts on politics, cars, investments or other content that doesn't apply to our study.

No links to eBay auctions...  UNLESS there is a legitimate point of study to be made about a specific item apart from the auction in progress.  If in doubt, please just post an image of the item you want to talk about in the group photo album.  The moderator will have discretion on what is or is not an appropriate link.

Everyone gets one warning.  After that it's a one-week suspension from the list.  Third strike and you're banned from the list indefinitely.

1) While it's hard to resist, please send jokes,  "one liners" and other replies meant for only one or a few members by off line email.  Your post may not seem like a problem, but the banter can swamp out the content that everyone else is here to enjoy.

2) Brief posts to let members know about your new or updated sales web site are fine, as are occasional notes about this or that item for sale.  BUT, please do not clog the list with long or constant advertisements.  

Members who persist in abusing 1) and 2) above will be subject to warning, suspension or removal at the moderator's discretion.

Two final points... 	Please be considerate in trimming off unnecessary old message text when you reply to posts.  It makes the digest mode hard to enjoy.

	Please don't post unclickable urls that users will have to copy and paste piece by piece into their browsers to view.  http://tinyurl.com is a good tool for reducing monster urls into something clickable.

Enough of this administrative stuff, let's study nihonto...
