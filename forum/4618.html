<h3>Interesting sword</h3>
by <i>dwmac2000</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2012645205">Hello,  Recently purchased a sword which was in a closet wrapped in a <br/>
blanket for the last 60+ years.  It has a Shin gunto tsuka and a older <br/>
appearing Kyo-sukashi tsuba.  The blade is a bit "rough" but still has <br/>
very visible hada.  The hamon appears to be Suguha for the most part.<br/>
The hada is very prominant, it seems to be a Itame/Mokume mix with <br/>
Masame near the ha.  The Masame hada also can be clearly seen through <br/>
the kissaki.  The sword is unsigned with a osujikai yasurime. The <br/>
nakago condition appears ( a guess ) approx. 1800-1860.  I'm thinking <br/>
a late Edo copy of an Koto Yamato.  Nagasa 65cm, machi width 3.1 cm, <br/>
yokote 2.1 cm, sori 1.5 cm.  Do these characteristics suggest to <br/>
anyone a particular Shinshinto School, Smith or Province. I know it <br/>
would be difficult with or without blade in hand, but any advice or <br/>
information would be appreciated.   Thanks.....</div>

Definitely appreciate the information!  I will research your<br/>
suggestions.  There does seem to be a spot or two of ayasugi.  The sword<br/>
seems to have a hada simular to koto Yamato Taima and Shikkake both. <br/>
Sure wish the nakago appeared 500 yrs. older.  None the less, still a<br/>
good research project.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks Again,<br/>

Anytime I see a masame running along the ha it makes me think "early" and starts me looking for further clues. The sword is relatively short; is the nakago original (ubu) or could it be O-suriage? The mention of O-sugikai yasurime makes me think it is ubu, unsigned. It still makes me think ko-to with Yamato characteristic; sue-Tegai perhaps?

Thank you for your imput!  My first thought was also the possibility of<br/>
a well preserved nakago.  As far as determining if it is ubu or<br/>
o-suriage unfortunately exceeds my expertise.  I've taken a few photos<br/>
and will post them as soon as possible.  I was unable to capture all<br/>
aspects of my description in the pictures, but hopefully they will help.<br/>
The sori is 1.5 cm and is tori.  The blade as mentioned is a bit "<br/>
rough" but is overall healthy.  I  detect no "drop off " running my<br/>
thumb and fore finger through the machi area.  Possibly another clue to<br/>
a later blade??<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again,<br/>
