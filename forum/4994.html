<br/>
Paypal is fine (I believe my email address is all you need), otherwise a check is also okay with me, sent to: Ron Hartmann, 5907 Deerwood Drive, St. Louis, MO 63123-2707.<br/>
<br/>
Just check before mailing a check to make sure I've got a copy for you. Okay, I think that about covers it all. <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
For those of you who did not purchase copies of the beautifully illustrated 2007 catalogue of the  Kokusai Tosogu Kai 2nd International Covention and Exhibition (Tokyo 2007). I have a few copies remaining here which are available for sale by mail if anyone is interested. <br/>
<br/>
Print quality is high quality, hardcover with slip-cover, 116 pages showing color photos of tosogu exhibited including 17 double pages of period koshirae, in color. An article extensively researched  by Fred Geyer on what has been previously considered Tokei (clockgear) tsuba, today realized to be a Christian motif, and an interesting interview with Kengo Sekido is also in the catalogue. I've posted a few photos of the catalogue on Yahoo photos in my folder named, Ron STL. Perhaps this link will work for you. <br/>
