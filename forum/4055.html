<div id="ygrps-yiv-99814847">Greetings all,<br/>
<br/>
Just thinking that it would be nice to tackle a new kantei problem about now...!  I've very <br/>
much enjoyed these, and it's been great to see the thoughts everyone has shared in <br/>
considering each of the pieces reviewed thus far.  A terrific learning experience, plus we <br/>
get to see some super tsuba...  So, just a gentle nudge here hoping to stir the kantei <br/>
spirits!  <br/>

I'm just back from a trip to Arizona.  There wasn't time for a new tsuba kantei before I left, but I will put one together soon.<br/>
