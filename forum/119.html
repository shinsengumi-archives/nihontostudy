Hi Matt,<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The question is "Why do hizento have such thin skins ?"<br/>
- Matt <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
They all don't. <br/>
Some do - the kobuse construction (lower quality) where better steel is<br/>
used on the outer edge, but only in a thin layer as this was cheaper.<br/>
They can certainly have a very thin outer edge.<br/>
<br/>
The sanmai construction are the better swords (Tadayoshi 1, 2, 3, 4<br/>
(maybe), 8, Masahiro 1 etc. and they have thicker steel. The better<br/>
steel is used as the core.<br/>
<br/>
I am of the opinion that the Tadayoshi used imported steel as it was<br/>
readily available. That maybe why the hada is so tight. Now, how<br/>
expensive this was I have no idea - but if it was expensive, then they<br/>
could have used it in a thin outer layer (kobuse) - saving costs.  The<br/>
other factor to consider is that because the hada is so tight and<br/>
flawless in Hizen blades, when you polish through it into the core<br/>
steel, it then looks awful. In other Schools you probably wouldn't<br/>
notice the difference as the outer steel hada can be coarse as well.<br/>
There might only be a slight colour variation.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Kind regards, <br/>
<br/>

<h3>Iron Sand</h3>
by <i>gentleman9</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-623901041">Ok I have what may be a silly question but I've been<br/>
dying to ask it for some time now. Where does the iron<br/>
sand for making tamahage (spelling is not right I<br/>
know) come from? <br/>

As far as exactly where in Japan the black sand beaches and stream beds are<br/>
found, I'll have to punt.  But generically, the source for tamahagane is<br/>
just that, a type of black sand.  Most all beach sands contain some black<br/>
sand consisting of magnetite, chemically Fe3O4, containing iron in both the<br/>
+2 and +3 oxidation states.  As the name implies, it is magnetic, and simply<br/>
by running a magnet through beach sand, you will collect the magnetite<br/>
grains.  A great concentrating method that was likely not available to the<br/>
Japanese before cheap magnets became available in the modern age.  They used<br/>
a water flow ripple method instead (sluice box), not as efficient.  I<br/>
imagine that the traditional Japanese used sand from the few places where<br/>
magnetite was a major fraction of the sand total, giving the bulk sand an<br/>
overall "black" look.  But where those beaches and stream beds were exactly,<br/>
I'll have to leave to someone else to tell.  Kapp does mention Shimane<br/>
Province as the major source of tamahagane (80% of total) from the late<br/>
Muromachi onward, but doesn't specify the koto era sources, except that they<br/>
were scattered.  Note: Kapp also indicates the source of tamahagane as<br/>
Fe2O3, but this is hematite, a red color as the name implies.  It is indeed<br/>
a good iron source, but not what was available to the Japanese, I believe.<br/>

Thanks for the info. So it was basically volcanic<br/>
run-off deposits. I wonder if the black sand beaches<br/>
of The Big Island of Hawaii wouldn't be a bad source<br/>
for tamahagane. Actually Hawaii as a whole is rich in<br/>
iron in the soil it explains all the red dirt. Anyone<br/>
have a big enough electro magnet I could borrow next<br/>
time I go to Hawaii? <br/>

I don't know whether the Kalapana Black Sand Beach is magnetite or <br/>
not (or whether it's even still there - it was supposedly run over by <br/>
a fresh magma flow a few years back - I was there about thirty years <br/>
ago, but wasn't interested in its magnetic properties at the time).  <br/>
But a typical US beach has quite a bit of magnetite in the sand.  A <br/>
kid's magnet will net you a small vial full in a few tens of <br/>
minutes.  A serious Edmund Scientific magnet should get you enough in <br/>
an hour to make a sword, if you could figure out how to smelt it.  <br/>
I've thought about making an electromagnet to collect it (better than <br/>
a permanent magnet because you can turn it off and drop the magnetite <br/>
you've picked up, rather than try to pull it off the magnet by <br/>
hand).  But, again, what would I do with it?  It has to be heated in <br/>
a reducing atmosphere to get iron/steel out of it.  Anyone have an <br/>
idea for a mini-tartara?  BTW, an amateur US swordsmith I spoke with <br/>
years ago (since lost contact) did make his own tamahagane, and <br/>
forged a small blade from it, and showed same to Yoshihara at the <br/>
Solvang Knife Show.  He told me that Yoshindo immediately recognized <br/>
the difference in tetsu, and asked the US smith where he got his <br/>
steel.  I have heard from other sources that the source of the steel <br/>
(tamahagane, mill, electrolytic, wootz, etc.) does indeed result in <br/>
differences in the tetsu visible to the experienced viewer.<br/>

	You need look no further than Kangawas' Kanayama (iron <br/>

sources for good Soshu satetsu...<br/>
