<h3>new nihonto collector needs help with tsuba mei</h3>
by <i>mercierarmory</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-875811552">Hello everyone, new member here. My name is Mike and I was <br/>
recently offered a couple japanese swords. I have been collecting <br/>
swords for the past 10 years or so, but primarily European. The one <br/>
is a WWII officer's with a mei on the blade of Ando Kanemoto. It is <br/>
in beautiful shape and I did not see any faults with it at all. <br/>
   The other one has me a bit confused which is one reason I joined <br/>
the group. The blade is unsigned, but the tsuba does have a <br/>
signature. I have asked a lot of people, but no one is able to give <br/>
me a definate answer as to what it is. I assume the 2 sets of <br/>
characters is that of the smith and the school, but I don't know for <br/>
sure. Pictures of the tsuba and the tsuka can be found in the folder <br/>
I created at:<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Like I hinted at, I am quite new to Japanese weaponry, and <br/>
translating kanji is certainly wayyyy out of my field. What I have <br/>
been able to come up with on the tsuba could be a few things. First, <br/>
the 2 charcters on the left (I don't know if everyone has the kanji <br/>
font on their computers but I will put it here anyways).<br/>
<br/>
I see p for sure which I believe is either "teru" or "hide" the 2nd <br/>
character I have not determined for sure.<br/>
<br/>
On the right side, I see either ³ (tatsu) or possibly `ê (taki) <br/>
followed by, I believe ä (don't know the pronounciation) and then q <br/>
(shi).<br/>
<br/>
Obviously, what I want to know is who this tsuba is made by and the <br/>
school it is from. But also a potential date. I was informed by the <br/>
owner of the sword that it was authenticated by a friend of mine and <br/>
he thought it to be from the late 1600s or 1700s, but that is <br/>
certainly unclear.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you all in advance for your help. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-247979431">Hi Mike,<br/>
<br/>
The entire inscription is the maker's name. There is no school name included. I am <br/>
pretty sure the name is Hidemichi. The other three characters on the right side <br/>
begin with Ryû or dragon. The next two I cannot read. I have asked my wife to take <br/>
a look. I have check the Kinkô Dictionary and there is a listing for Hidemichi, but it <br/>
does not give his pseudonym. There are a couple of other possibilities for the <br/>
second character of the name. It looks like Michi, but it could also be Hideyuki <br/>
depending on the number of strokes in the character. Terunori is also a possiblilty <br/>
with the same characters as Hideyuki, just a different reading. Unfortunately, none <br/>
of these artists use the pseudonym shown on your tsuba.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1391464608">Hi again,<br/>
<br/>
We are pretty sure the artist's name is Hideyuki 英随, but we cannot figure out the <br/>
last character in the pseudonym. The first two characters are Ryû 竜 and jô 丈, but <br/>
we are not sure of the third character. It could be an abbreviation of "E" or 衛. I <br/>
checked Haynes as well, but no listing for this name. It is a fairly nice tsuba.<br/>

 The kanji didn't show up on the post. Could you email me what you were <br/>
able to come up with at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:mercierarmory@...">mercierarmory@...</a>?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
