<h3>Major sale on books - Bridge of Dreams, LLC</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-665360770">In speaking with several good friends and fellow collectors recently, one<br/>
thing seems to make sense in times like these, and has been mentioned to me<br/>
over and over: it's a great time to hunker down with your books and add to<br/>
your knowledge to be able to take advantage of the inevitable buying<br/>
opportunities to come.<br/>
<br/>
I've got an inventory of books that's both wide and deep, and have been<br/>
grateful for the support of the collecting communities over the past 5 years<br/>
- selling books is my only occupation. I came to the conclusion a couple of<br/>
years ago that I can only do a good job selling books at the Chicago show -<br/>
coming up in just a month - and I've put all my efforts into that show and<br/>
my website.<br/>
<br/>
All these books do no good sitting in my stock, so I've decided to offer an<br/>
unprecedented 33% off sale through April 18th. Yes, in many cases, perhaps<br/>
most, that means I'll be selling for less than my cost, but I need the space<br/>
and money, and you need the books.<br/>
<br/>
Check my website, www.bridgeofdreams.com, and check back. I printed a<br/>
listing today of all the sword, sword fitting, and armor books I have which<br/>
aren't online, and it's hundreds. All those books are lined up or already in<br/>
boxes to haul to the Chicago show, and I'll be adding them to the website<br/>
daily, but ask if you are looking for something not listed, or want some<br/>
recommendations on particular subjects.<br/>
<br/>
You can order on the website using Visa/MasterCard/Amex/Discover or PayPal.<br/>
Your card or account is never charged until I confirm the total including<br/>
shipping, and I make a point of charging for shipping at my cost. I prefer<br/>
to ship Priority Mail, but can use other carriers if you prefer. Email me or<br/>
call if you have questions.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for looking, and I'm hoping to be of service!<br/>

Alas, it sold sometime last year, now that I look at a price that would have<br/>
still been too high for you.<br/>
<br/>
I was thinking about the show just yesterday, and your face popped into my<br/>
mind! I am looking forward to seeing you, and I'll try to have pictures of<br/>
the grandkids to bore you with. How's your lovely bride? She must have found<br/>
some other places to shop for you, but then again I've been lax about making<br/>
suggestions.<br/>
<br/>
Take care,<br/>
<br/>
Craig<br/>
