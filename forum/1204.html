The Akasaka made some very nice sukashi guards in mantis motif.  Also the Shonai Shoami did excellent (non-sukashi) work as did Sekibun.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Thanks Jim and Rich.  As for your above comments, I<br/>
think I have firmly established what I like.  Seperate<br/>
from these discussed pieces, I am seeking out various<br/>
other schools from the Mito Shoami type to have a<br/>
representation of all the schools that used the mantis<br/>
in their work.  My humble collection of 12 tsuba is<br/>
growing with representation of both kinko and sukashi.<br/>
I really would love to put out a book one day on just<br/>
mantis fittings.  Whoever owns that tsuba on the<br/>
Northern California site please feel free to leave<br/>
that to me in my will.  Given that however, I do like<br/>
these Mito tsuba and kinda like the idea of having a<br/>
potential dai-sho for mounting or at least 1 for<br/>
display and 1 for mounting.  Thanks again.<br/>
Ken<br/>
