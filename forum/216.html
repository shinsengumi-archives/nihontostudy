<h3>Sano Museum catalogue</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-221349593">The following was posted today by Arnold.  I also wonder what is said about the Gassan swords and their importance relative to this catalogue.  It seem early Gassan works are seldom seen illustrated and therefore not a lot of written material comes out regarding them.  I owned an early Gassan katana until passing on to a good friend here in St. Louis.  Even with a serious lamination fault in the kissaki it received relatively high "points" from the September 2001 NTHK Chicago shinsa who placed it mid-Muromachi.  My friend who now owns the Gassan saw all the illustrations in the catalogue and of course asked me about it, but I haven't a clue.  Can someone who reads Japanese explain the importance of illustrating the many Hojo and Gassan examples?<br/>

Hi:<br/>
  I recently got back from Japan and while there found a copy of the new<br/>
catalog from the Sano Museum in Shizuoka. It is titled An Early Style of A<br/>
Japanese Sword: a search for the origin of the curve. It is 9 x 12, 140<br/>
pp, and covers 59 different types of swords from five warabite-to, through<br/>
the koto era with most being Heian, Kamakura and Nanbokucho. Each is<br/>
illustrated with excellent photographs of the entire blade, monouchi and<br/>
nakago, and oshigata too of each blade.  <br/>
 Nothing is more important than shape both as a kantei starting point and<br/>
the one characteristic that makes Japanese swords - through its impact on<br/>
cutting efficiency - different from all others. I would dearly love to be<br/>
able to read the text, but that awaits translation. There are not less<br/>
than 10 Hoju swords illustrated and 10 Gassan, and the former is little<br/>
discussed in the literature. In that those two near-by groups account for<br/>
a third of the illustrations there must be some real importance to them in<br/>
shape determination, but I don't have a clue what it is!<br/>
 The Sano recently did two great shows, with catalogs, one on Rai and one<br/>
on Soshu, but something tells me this is by far the more important catalog<br/>
informationally.<br/>
 I believe Chris Bowen posted a couple of months ago that he was a source<br/>
for the catalog, and there are probably others.<br/>

<br/>
I have a copy, but have not read it very closely. Some here in Japan;<br/>
however, have commented that the Gassan pieces said to date from Heian to<br/>
Nambokucho period are clearly Mid-Muromachi. Once again, the Sano has<br/>
stirred up controversy with a very unusual show. Sorry I missed it. I will<br/>
go through the catalogue when I have a chance and give a summary.<br/>
