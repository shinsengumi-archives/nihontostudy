Assuming that koz96F is the correct one, it's Jiryuken Terumitsu.  Haynes number H 09594.0.  Family name Miyake.  Personal names Jiryuken and Naojiro.  Worked in Edo, Kyobashi ju.  Died ca. 1825.  First son of Miyake Terumitsu (different mitsu, H 09602).  Appears in Wakayama's Toso Kinko Jiten on page 36 and in his Toso Kodogu Meiji Taikai page 289 of volume 3.  <br/>
<br/>
I don't have time to scrutinize it, but the mei examples illustrated look reasonably close to yours.  The workmanship looks good.  Looks like the better of the two kozuka.  The motif is minogane.  These are hairy turtles that are supposed to be 1,000 years old and represent longevity.  The idea may have come from seeing turtles that were so old that their backs were covered with long algae growth.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, father Terumitsu was born in Nagasaki but studied in Edo under Yokoya Terukiyo I and Yokoya Soyo II.  He worked for the Mori Daimyo while in Edo.<br/>
