<h3>Looking for help to ID a tsuba...</h3>
by <i>darpa_ems</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-447952653">I've had this tsuba for well over 20 years, & have wondered what info<br/>
there might be on it... It's a rabbit & waves design, with no ID marks.<br/>
  It's iron, about 8cm x 8.5cm x 4mm. I believe it's a early 20th<br/>
cent. repro, at least I kind of hope it is, as it's been on several of<br/>
my practice swords over the years... When I got it it had a nice solid<br/>
brown patina, but enough rust scaling to need cleaning with a wirewheel.<br/>
<br/>
Pics are here-<br/>

<br/>
Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated.  Not looking to sell it,<br/>
just info on period, school, maker, etc... :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1602385208">Hi AW, welcome. Yes I think this is a Repo also, but maybe late 20th <br/>
century as a guess. It's a copy, I believe of a Kô Shôami tsuba that was <br/>
originally done in a soft metal (Yamagane from memory) in the Momoyama <br/>
period, or perhaps a bit earlier.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway. as I said, I think this is a very modern repo, just my opinioon <br/>
nayway.<br/>

thank you for the link.  I am aware of that one, the kozuka is self described as a reproduction, and truthfully, I am almost positive that the menuki are repros also.  so I would be looking just at the tsuba (which I do want), but unfortunately, with the euro being so expensive, it is too much money.  Still you never know so I appreciate the heads up.  all the best.<br/>
