	If you aren't a sword swinger like Paul, myself and others on this  <br/>
list you may not appreciate how important this site is. Please take a  <br/>
minute to look it up and read the petition and if you are so inclined  <br/>
please sign on. Swords swingers will love you and good karma is sure  <br/>
to follow if you all help to save this dojo.<br/>
-t<br/>
and yes please share this with anyone and everyone<br/>
