<h3>Mei with Kao</h3>
by <i>retalt</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2132484526">Hi all, I was flicking through 4 Aito ( I think this is the title ) Magazines/Catalogues I recieved today and am looking at a very long inscription that consists of  11 charactures and a Kao. I am working on the inscription ( should keep me busy for day's ) but am wondeing, when did Kao come into use on Sword mei ?, was this a Shinto or Shinshinto thing ? or did it happen in the earlier periods ?.<br/>
<br/>
This sword is dated ???? ????  the 4th year of Bunsei ( 1821 ) I will have to work on the front section, I assume it is a month or something. The mei will take a lot longer :-)<br/>
<br/>
cheers all<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1671980617">Just an update and correction. I worked out the mei, it wasn't as hard as I initially thought. It reads Shôji Chikuzen No Daijô Taikai Fuji Naotane with Kao. The Nengo reads Bunsei Gonen Chûshun, Mid spring of 1822 ( I had 1823 originally, sorry ) <br/>
<br/>
So, with that out of the way, my original question stands. When were KAO introduced into Mei ?. My original question ws related to swords but it would be interesting to know about kodogu as well.<br/>
<br/>
cheers<br/>

pieces, but in general, kao are a rather Shin-Shinto thing.<br/>
