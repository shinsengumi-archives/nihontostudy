<h3>New here</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-469558561">Hello everybody. I'm a newbiy here so I thought I might introduce <br/>
myself a little. My name is Leroy and I live in Northern California. <br/>
I have been doing my best to read as much as I can about Nihonto. I <br/>
think I am ready to purchase on, and now I would like some opinions. <br/>
<br/>
I was wondering what you would choose. I found 3 swords that I like <br/>
and are about in my price range; One was made in 1977, one in the <br/>
1930's (papered-NBTHK) and another in the 1860's (papered-NBTHK).<br/>
<br/>
Of those with more experience, which would you choose? The one from <br/>
the 1860's does have some light rust, the others are in full polish. <br/>
The dealers are reputable.<br/>
<br/>
Any help would be much appreciated. Thanks in advance.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
What's best depends totally on what they are, who made them, state of <br/>
polish is not as important as the state of the sword. If the 1930's <br/>
sword has NBTHK Hozon, then it will be a good smith I assume, there were <br/>
many great smiths in the mid 1800's and the new swords are good also.<br/>
<br/>
what have you been reading ?.<br/>
