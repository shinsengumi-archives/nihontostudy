<h3>Where do you buy your Tsuba?</h3>
by <i>anwahi</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1110084349">Hello,<br/>
<br/>
I'm new here and to collecting Tsuba. Where do you buy your Tsuba from? <br/>
I know there's several websites you can find with a Google search, an <br/>
occasional Token Kai show like the one in SF, or Ebay (most look like <br/>
junk). I'm looking for good sources of authentic Tsuba. Obviously the <br/>
only way to be really sure of authenticity is to purchase papered <br/>
Tsuba, but because I'm starting off I want some sources of authentic <br/>
Tsuba more reasonably priced. Any suggestions?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your helpo in advance,<br/>

   <br/>
  I don't think you need to buy papered tsuba to make sure they are authentic.  Just buy from reputable dealers.<br/>
   <br/>
  Perhaps the easiest way to learn about fittings is to buy as many books as you can and educate yourself - go to shows as well.<br/>
   <br/>
  Good luck with your collecting!<br/>

by far, the best dealer in Tsuba is some guy named BBK<br/>

check out his fantastic website with about 30 tsuba, most with papers<br/>

Sorry to sound like such a "merchant" but if you're interested I can send you some pictures of a very nice selection of good quality iron tsuba that I'm selling. Most are $200 range, more or less. If you are new at this I would be happy to recommend good ones that would help teach you about these things. Some of these have been to a number of shows and are now kept home so that I can keep my table at the shows, fresh. All are authentic, for sure. The shows seem to have a wonderful selection of nice quality tsuba these days and that is good for the buyer, bad for the seller since there is such a "selection" to pick from. Anyway...just thought I'd toss this idea out to you. I've been around for going on 40 years...gosh, that's a little frightening to put in writing! <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1913104228">Anthony,<br/>
<br/>
I also have purchased from Rich's sources (he is a<br/>
sukashi tsuba slut by the way).  In addition I have<br/>
purchased from Ron.  I would purchase from all of them<br/>
again.  Many tsuba are not papered, it is not worth<br/>
the cost of many to put them through shinsa.  Since it<br/>
is much harder to attribute to a particular smith, you<br/>
will also be likely to get a paper to a general school<br/>
(for the unsigned ones).  There are all price points.<br/>
<br/>
The only one I have not purchased from is that Kurt<br/>
Holtz dude.  The major reason is that he tries to pass<br/>
off crickets as preying mantises.  As if I don't know<br/>
the difference.  Gets me all excited in searching ebay<br/>
and have a hit other than the Chen crappers and it<br/>
turns out to be a waste.  Even mentions me by name,<br/>
like he couldn't just email me. <br/>
<br/>
Be careful buying books, especially those japanese<br/>
ones.  They are addicting in their own right and then<br/>
you end up with all these books you can't read.  Of<br/>
course, if you can read them, I will tell you which<br/>
ones to buy and you can translate them for me.  <br/>
<br/>
Remember tsuba are 2 sided, if one sided don't buy or<br/>
if already purchased certainly don't email list that<br/>
you baught a 1 sided tsuba (I love to bring this<br/>
incident up makes me still laugh- happened to a list<br/>
member a few years ago).  Milt can give you a<br/>
dissertation on how to buy on ebay.  Tom Helm can also<br/>
tell you why those tsuba's recommended by Milt suck. <br/>
Actually I have gotten a few off ebay over the years<br/>
and prices are usually good.  Just don't buy anything<br/>
from China, unless from a pilot living in Hong Kong<br/>
but he only cares about hizen (he gets touchy about<br/>
condemning all of china- basically don't buy from the<br/>
billion or so people minus one).<br/>
<br/>
Ok, I put a lot of list history in this post and most<br/>
likely you have no idea of the stories behind them,<br/>
but I am reminiscing.  Buy some books and find some<br/>
collectors to handle tsuba.  Some like kinko some like<br/>
sukashi, some like both.<br/>
<br/>
You can always ask questions here.   Just remember<br/>
that any preying mantis themed tsuba and/or sword<br/>
fittings must be cheaply sold to me.  Milt keeps on<br/>
trying to sell me stuff at full retail when I know he<br/>
got them cheap, plus I am originally from NY and we<br/>
don't pay retail!  He complains about son's tuition at<br/>
BU and I keep telling him, I went to Grad school there<br/>
and they aren't getting anymore of my money.  Have<br/>
fun!<br/>
<br/>
all the best,<br/>

  Good info. Not sure whether to take it that this Kurt guy is a fraud or he has two inch thick glasses and can't tell the bugs apart.<br/>
   <br/>
  Might be a simple question, but what is kinko or sukashi? <br/>
   <br/>
  From reading what you said, is the Mantis design highly sought after or maybe you can tell what are the best designs are to collect? I'm sure a lot is personal tastes, but the question is more for what will hold value and easily be resold.<br/>
   <br/>
  Thanks,<br/>

I also have purchased from Rich's sources (he is a<br/>
sukashi tsuba slut by the way).  In addition I have<br/>
purchased from Ron.  I would purchase from all of them<br/>
again.  Many tsuba are not papered, it is not worth<br/>
the cost of many to put them through shinsa.  Since it<br/>
is much harder to attribute to a particular smith, you<br/>
will also be likely to get a paper to a general school<br/>
(for the unsigned ones).  There are all price points.<br/>
<br/>
The only one I have not purchased from is that Kurt<br/>
Holtz dude.  The major reason is that he tries to pass<br/>
off crickets as preying mantises.  As if I don't know<br/>
the difference.  Gets me all excited in searching ebay<br/>
and have a hit other than the Chen crappers and it<br/>
turns out to be a waste.  Even mentions me by name,<br/>
like he couldn't just email me. <br/>
<br/>
Be careful buying books, especially those japanese<br/>
ones.  They are addicting in their own right and then<br/>
you end up with all these books you can't read.  Of<br/>
course, if you can read them, I will tell you which<br/>
ones to buy and you can translate them for me.  <br/>
<br/>
Remember tsuba are 2 sided, if one sided don't buy or<br/>
if already purchased certainly don't email list that<br/>
you baught a 1 sided tsuba (I love to bring this<br/>
incident up makes me still laugh- happened to a list<br/>
member a few years ago).  Milt can give you a<br/>
dissertation on how to buy on ebay.  Tom Helm can also<br/>
tell you why those tsuba's recommended by Milt suck. <br/>
Actually I have gotten a few off ebay over the years<br/>
and prices are usually good.  Just don't buy anything<br/>
from China, unless from a pilot living in Hong Kong<br/>
but he only cares about hizen (he gets touchy about<br/>
condemning all of china- basically don't buy from the<br/>
billion or so people minus one).<br/>
<br/>
Ok, I put a lot of list history in this post and most<br/>
likely you have no idea of the stories behind them,<br/>
but I am reminiscing.  Buy some books and find some<br/>
collectors to handle tsuba.  Some like kinko some like<br/>
sukashi, some like both.<br/>
<br/>
You can always ask questions here.   Just remember<br/>
that any preying mantis themed tsuba and/or sword<br/>
fittings must be cheaply sold to me.  Milt keeps on<br/>
trying to sell me stuff at full retail when I know he<br/>
got them cheap, plus I am originally from NY and we<br/>
don't pay retail!  He complains about son's tuition at<br/>
BU and I keep telling him, I went to Grad school there<br/>
and they aren't getting anymore of my money.  Have<br/>

<h3>Re: [nihontostudy] Where do you buy your Tsuba?</h3>
by <i>davidzincavage</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1985422433">Kinko refers to soft metal work tsuba.  Sukashi refers to pierced tsuba. <br/>
<br/>
There are certainly no rules as to what designs are best to collect.  If you lack opinions, you should collect books.  I recommend starting with Sasano and Torigoye's books.  You might want to own the Sukashi and Akasaka tusba Sano Museum catalogues as well.  And it's nice to have the Haynes catalogues.  Even just those books will represent a substantial investment, so think twice, before proceeding. <br/>
<br/>
The only Nihonto material certain to hold its value and be easily resellable is very expensive top quality stuff.  Top quality tsuba are not necessarily easily identified or defined, but pieces of the sort sell at auction at Christie's and Sotheby's for thousands of dollars.  Not uncommonly for more than $5000.    <br/>

Stay away from mantis!  Actually, I think you should<br/>
do as David said and invest in a book or 2.  It is<br/>
personal, what you like is what you like- collect<br/>
that.  There are many collections out there- same<br/>
school, similiar design, certain periods of time,<br/>
types of construction, and so on and so on.  I would<br/>
also agree profit should not be the motivating factor,<br/>
too many guys will tell you their stories of losses.  <br/>
<br/>
For me I had a connection with the mantis and built my<br/>
collection around that motif.  I like finding the<br/>
renditions of the bug from the various schools and<br/>
time periods.  It also helps me sort through the many<br/>
available items for sale.  That is my personal taste. <br/>
Milt I think took his love of hawk paintings and that<br/>
transferred over into his tsuba collection, although,<br/>
he doesn't stick to just that motif.  <br/>
<br/>
Gain some basic knowledge 1st.  It will help you to<br/>
avoid buying mistakes and also help you put together a<br/>
better collection if that is your desire.  <br/>
<br/>
One of the nice things about fittings is that you<br/>
don't have to spend thousands to get something decent.<br/>
 However, you can spend $40,000 if you want/can.  I am<br/>
impressed with their artistic qualities.  I don't have<br/>
a mentor really and I haven't handled as much as I<br/>
would like, but I am slowly learning.  I would love to<br/>
sit down with someone more knowledgeable and be shown<br/>
iron quality.  Jim G. said all it takes is handling a<br/>
few thousand tsuba.  <br/>
<br/>
Good luck.<br/>

Sorry to sound like such a "merchant" but if you're interested I can send<br/>
you some pictures of a very nice selection of good quality iron tsuba that<br/>
I'm selling. Most are $200 range, more or less. If you are new at this I<br/>
would be happy to recommend good ones that would help teach you about these<br/>
things. Some of these have been to a number of shows and are now kept home<br/>
so that I can keep my table at the shows, fresh. All are authentic, for<br/>
sure. The shows seem to have a wonderful selection of nice quality tsuba<br/>
these days and that is good for the buyer, bad for the seller since there is<br/>
such a "selection" to pick from. Anyway...just thought I'd toss this idea<br/>
out to you. I've been around for going on 40 years...gosh, that's a little<br/>

Hello,<br/>
<br/>
I'm new here and to collecting Tsuba. Where do you buy your Tsuba from?<br/>
I know there's several websites you can find with a Google search, an<br/>
occasional Token Kai show like the one in SF, or Ebay (most look like<br/>
junk). I'm looking for good sources of authentic Tsuba. Obviously the<br/>
only way to be really sure of authenticity is to purchase papered<br/>
Tsuba, but because I'm starting off I want some sources of authentic<br/>
Tsuba more reasonably priced. Any suggestions?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your helpo in advance,<br/>

	For 2006 we have decided that our meetings will fall on the third  <br/>
Sunday of each month, thus to avoid lots of holidays, playoffs, bowl  <br/>
games and such. We will be there on the 15th, discussing anything  <br/>
with the character "ONE" in it; Mori family mon, Ichinotani kabuto,  <br/>
Sadakazu, Korekazu, Ichimai-boshi and mayhaps an Ichimonji katana or  <br/>
two.<br/>
	There isn't much good I can say publicly about the SF Japanese Sword  <br/>
Society, I would give them a look if you wish but wouldn't give them  <br/>
any of your money or your items to handle until you know more about  <br/>
them and us. Meetings start just after noon, hope you will join us.  <br/>
Feel free to email me off list with questions...<br/>

             Has Christmas come early?!  I could have sworn it was only<br/>
friday!<br/>
You're telling me you know of contacts in Canada for study and collection?<br/>
Well Merry Christmas to me!  LOL<br/>
I live in New Brunswick on the east coast. Occasionally I'll make it out<br/>
west to do some mountain climbing and I've been down to New Hampshire, Mount<br/>
Washington. Apart from that, I usually don't get state side. I can just see<br/>
myself trying to explain to a customs officer that I'm travelling to the<br/>
U.S. to attend a Japanese Sword Show! LOL! I'm going to need a passport next<br/>
year just to cross the border into Maine so I can buy cheap milk!<br/>
Where abouts  are you located John?<br/>
Any information you can provide me with would be greatly appreciated. If<br/>
anyone out there in Nihonto land wants to come to New Brunswick and share<br/>
their knowledge, I will supply Beer and Lobsters.<br/>
Now if there's going to be more than 10 of you or any international<br/>
arrivals, (Andres), I will need some time to plan.<br/>
Have a great holiday season everyone. It's been great listening to your<br/>
banter.<br/>

Sorry to sound like such a "merchant" but if you're interested I can send<br/>
you some pictures of a very nice selection of good quality iron tsuba that<br/>
I'm selling. Most are $200 range, more or less. If you are new at this I<br/>
would be happy to recommend good ones that would help teach you about these<br/>
things. Some of these have been to a number of shows and are now kept home<br/>
so that I can keep my table at the shows, fresh. All are authentic, for<br/>
sure. The shows seem to have a wonderful selection of nice quality tsuba<br/>
these days and that is good for the buyer, bad for the seller since there is<br/>
such a "selection" to pick from. Anyway...just thought I'd toss this idea<br/>
out to you. I've been around for going on 40 years...gosh, that's a little<br/>
frightening to put in writing!<br/>

Hello,<br/>
<br/>
I'm new here and to collecting Tsuba. Where do you buy your Tsuba from?<br/>
I know there's several websites you can find with a Google search, an<br/>
occasional Token Kai show like the one in SF, or Ebay (most look like<br/>
junk). I'm looking for good sources of authentic Tsuba. Obviously the<br/>
only way to be really sure of authenticity is to purchase papered<br/>
Tsuba, but because I'm starting off I want some sources of authentic<br/>
Tsuba more reasonably priced. Any suggestions?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your helpo in advance,<br/>
Anthony<br/>

Well unfortunately I am on the other cost, in Vancouver, no lobsters here <br/>
just Dungeness and snow crabs on this side.<br/>
<br/>
I do not know of any study groups in the Maritimes but Toronto has a couple <br/>
and Montreal has a few people into nihonto and armour.  We have a good group <br/>
in Vancouver if you are ever out here getting lost on our hills.<br/>
<br/>
I wish you a Merry Christmas, and if you do not have a study group create <br/>
one, all you need is one other person to start, and your on your way.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1380566738">Thanks John,<br/>
                Does your study correspond by e-mail also or is it strickly<br/>
in person? I was in Tofino for the first time two years ago and I loved it!<br/>
Mountains, water and NO BUGS! Truely God's country.  I'm basically looking<br/>
for opportunities to at least "see" Nihonto products. Are there merchants of<br/>
Nihonto related products in Canada? I'm aware of Darcy Brockbank. Great<br/>
stuff but very high end. I'm looking to find "entrance level" stuff. I've<br/>
even gone from looking for Katana's to Tsuba's. Are there sellers on Ebay<br/>
that have good reputations? Does Vancouver have a good supply of sellers?<br/>
Any annual shows? Sorry for sounding desperate!  LOL!  But I don't in a<br/>
Nihonto rich enviroment!<br/>
<br/>
Great talking to you John.<br/>

Hi Mark;<br/>
<br/>
Well unfortunately I am on the other cost, in Vancouver, no lobsters here<br/>
just Dungeness and snow crabs on this side.<br/>
<br/>
I do not know of any study groups in the Maritimes but Toronto has a couple<br/>
and Montreal has a few people into nihonto and armour.  We have a good group<br/>
in Vancouver if you are ever out here getting lost on our hills.<br/>
<br/>
I wish you a Merry Christmas, and if you do not have a study group create<br/>
one, all you need is one other person to start, and your on your way.<br/>
<br/>
John<br/>
<br/>

If the Andres you refer to is me, I'm as New Yorker as they come, not <br/>
international at all. I work in Manhattan and live in the Poconos. :)<br/>
<br/>
Beer and lobster sounds great. Just pick a date... I've always meant <br/>
to go take a look at New Brunswick, especially Fundy Bay. Heard good <br/>
stuff about it.<br/>
<br/>
If you didn't mean me, then too late, I'm still going.<br/>

<br/>
You should know about crappy tsuba.  <br/>
You have cornered the market and made a study of them over the past 5 years.  <br/>
<br/>
Isn't it time you moved onto at least mediocre tsuba and fittings?  <br/>
<br/>
Even the Ferengi appreciate beauty, even if it is at the most basic level.<br/>

Have a Merry Christmas,<br/>

  I collect the " designs " that strike me.......I don't care what <br/>
  school, material, and I like to buy them " cheap " like a Ferengi so <br/>
  at least i have a fair chance to get my $ back or even make 10 bucks <br/>
  or so when I get tired of some of them.<br/>

<h3>Re: [nihontostudy] Milt & info about NY shinsa</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1532930614">Pent up aggression, must payback year's worth of cheap<br/>
insults and bug insults.  I kid because I love.  Also<br/>
since attempts to get mantis stuff cheaply in private<br/>
have failed, so I figure public badgering and insults<br/>
are next move.  <br/>
<br/>
Wish I could meet you all in Tampa.  One day I will<br/>
make a show!  As rumors to another shinsa in NY, will<br/>
it be just shinsa or is there a chance at a show?  For<br/>
those that went, what was it like last time, were<br/>
there any buying/trading opportunities?  People<br/>
networking etc? When I moved to Maryland, I thought I<br/>
would be able to make NY shows (I'm from there).  Of<br/>
course they stopped having them the year I got close. <br/>
At least I have a token kai to go to 1hr 45 mins away<br/>
now even if it kills me.<br/>

was driving my little Honda Civic through downtown Manhattan, dodging<br/>
all the Checker cabs (built like tanks, and they were all dented!),<br/>
listening to the radio, and heard, "This is station KNYC, 1500 on your<br/>
radio dial, but for you, 1498."<br/>
<br/>
NC  ;o)<br/>
<br/>
And with that shaggy dog story, here's wishing all here a Merry Xmas,<br/>
or, if preferred, a more PC Happy Holidaze!</div>

gentiles.<br/>
Only gentiles pay retail..............<br/>
<br/>
happy Hanukkah, may your candles last more than  8 days.<br/>
<br/>
p.s. I wished everyone a merry Christmas and a happy New year, plus <br/>
happy Kwanzaa so I won't nag again...... stay safe, stay sober ( stay <br/>
away from the dry red ) , don't slip on the ice AND watch out for that <br/>
falling icicles !!<br/>

Jets or Giants?!� LOL!!� Even better, not as far to come.� You'll still have<br/>
to get a passport so you can travel to hostile evil empire of Canada. Bay of<br/>
Fundy is in my backyard so we can go kayaking.<br/>
I'll pick you up in St. Stephen when you cross over from Calais. August and<br/>
September are the best months here.�All you need to bring is your Nihonto<br/>

Talk to you soon. Have a great New Years Eve.<br/>

If the Andres you refer to is me, I'm as New Yorker as they come, not<br/>
international at all. I work in Manhattan and live in the Poconos. :)<br/>
<br/>
Beer and lobster sounds great. Just pick a date... I've always meant<br/>
to go take a look at New Brunswick, especially Fundy Bay. Heard good<br/>
stuff about it.<br/>
<br/>
If you didn't mean me, then too late, I'm still going.<br/>
