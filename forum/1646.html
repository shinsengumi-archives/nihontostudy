<h3>Cheap but Usefull katana</h3>
by <i>fraxcr</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1833424060">Hi, I'm newbie on this. I started practicing kenjutsu and iaido with <br/>
great effort and i love it, Well i'm want to buy my first katana, <br/>
and i know you already got many of this questions but here is it. <br/>
<br/>
I'm looking for a cheap but useful katana to start with, i have not <br/>
much budget so i'm trying to look something around $100 more or less<br/>
(i can try to afford more). I find this katanas but because i'm <br/>
newbie i don't know which one are good. <br/>

<br/>
I don't know how the quality is or if they work for what i do. <br/>
<br/>
Right now my choice is the Paul Chen's Practical katana at $149 <br/>
Or the leather katana from united cutlery.. (also what do you think <br/>
about the full tang?) cheaper but if it works it's ok for me. I want <br/>
to start with something that feels real, i practice a lot with the <br/>
bokken but you all know its weight is lots less than a real katana. <br/>
If there's any other type, brand or store that you can recommend i <br/>
will really appreciate it. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your time. <br/>

*That samurai 3000 katana looks so cheesy don't you think? lol.</div>

 </span></blockquote>Not too many of us are using swords like this for cutting.<br/>
<br/>
I think with swords at these levels, you're running a major risk of<br/>
injuring yourself through equipment failure.<br/>
<br/>
From what some of the guys write, you may be better off with the stuff<br/>
at www.bugei.com and/or ask your questions there.<br/>

Practical Katana include the following.  1. The tsuka is non-<br/>
removable (in fact, the nakago has a kink in it to help insure it <br/>

the blade, and any replacement tsuka may not be removed by just <br/>
sliding it off, due to the nakago kink.  2. The shape of the blade is <br/>
actually fairly good in that it is reasonably appropriate, regular <br/>
and lacking in waves/ripples; however, it is "flat polished", i.e., <br/>
little or no niku (clamshell curve from the shinogi to the ha).  <br/>
Thus, it should cut rather well, but be more susceptible to chipping <br/>
than it would if more traditionally shaped.  Even with these <br/>
reservations, I feel the Chen katana is a good deal for the money, <br/>
particularly if you can get a good discount on Ebay.  FWIW.<br/>
