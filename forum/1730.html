The undecorated mokko-shaped one is the older of the two.  Given the style of the plate and shape and the angle of the kozuka ana (the oval opening) it may be as old as the late Muromachi to Momoyama period (late 16th C).  Given the style of raised rim, it would probably be designated as a Katchushi (armor maker's) tsuba, although that is more a convenient term than a literal truth.  It's a nicely proportioned and apparently well made guard, although simple.  It looks like there is black lacquer on a lot of the surface.<br/>
<br/>
The style of the dragon on the other tsuba is typical for Echizen Kinai work from the mid to late Edo period.  It's often seen in larger tsuba, but less common in tanto guards.  Given the soft detail and the look of the seppa dai (the central flat oval) it might be cast.  I can't tell for sure from the photos.  <br/>
<br/>
What does the rest of the mounting with the older guard look like?<br/>

the Higa [spelling] style, they are Water Dragons;  it was cast in <br/>
soft metal.  yeah, mid - late shinshinto.  always mumei.  and more <br/>
likely was made for a ko-wakizashi not a tanto.  too big for tanto.<br/>
