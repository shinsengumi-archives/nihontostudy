<h3>Yagyu family pattern book</h3>
by <i>davidzincavage</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-590603825">The current Sotheby's tsuba auction references the Yagyu family pattern book on various Yagyu lots.<br/>
<br/>
Examples:<br/>
<br/>
Lot 828:<br/>
<br/>
"The design is illustrated in the Yagyu family pattern book, no. 78"<br/>
<br/>
Lot 829<br/>
"The design is no. 39 in the Yagyu family pattern book"<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I've heard of its existence but never heard of it being published.  Has anyone else? <br/>

There are a few Yagyu guards illustrated from the pattern book on<br/>
p.189-190 of Haynes Catalog #9. It seems like I saw more of the<br/>
pattern book published somewhere, but at the moment I can't find what<br/>
that would be.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps someone with a better memory or filing system will help out.<br/>

There is a version of the first 36 designs reproduced in  "Owari to Mikawa no Tsubako," Okamoto Yasutomo, Toyohashi 1983.  It's a must have book for people interested in Owari region guards.  <br/>

<h3>finally got my tsuba and some new pics</h3>

Has obvious forging layers in the mimi ( quite flat ) 81 x 79 x 6mm, The <br/>

This is the other, small wakizashi guard, quite fine.  65 x 62 x 3mm. <br/>

<h3>Middle timers story</h3>
by <i>toyama1_2000</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1249071084">Well I got busy and forgot to add some sword stories<br/>
Since I am not an old timer nor new at it I gonna call<br/>
this "middle timers stories." Anyway, in 1990 Bob<br/>
Coleman arranged a sword appreciation tour. His wife,<br/>
Bill MIller, Paul Davidson, Mel Oka, Ray Deadman, Bob<br/>
Lewertt,   Keith Hostler and myself went. Seems like<br/>
someone else but oh that memory button......Anyway too<br/>
much happened to repot it all but we did visit ( and<br/>
also dine with) Michihiro Tanabe. He laid out maybe 50<br/>
swords for us and we kanteied some. Kotetsu's , Kiya<br/>
Maro , freaking all the heavy hitters. The deadest<br/>
feeling block of metal was the Kiyo maru. Nothing to<br/>
it. We aslo went out for a really cool dinner served<br/>
by Geisha style chicks. Mr. Sugiyama (who was a<br/>
polishing agent for Tanabe) attended as well as Gordon<br/>
Robson. I have a back piece of a Samurai with a<br/>
naginata and made a fool of myself running around<br/>
wothout a shirt on. Jeez, no class. Years later when I<br/>
met with Tanabe at the NBTHK convention in Osaka (Paul<br/>
Davidson and I) Tanabe says "Oh you're the tattoo<br/>
guy!" Well I guess it's beter t be<br/>
remembered.....than........Bob Elder<br/>

If ignorance is bliss, how come I'm not ecstatic!?</div>
