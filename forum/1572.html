<h3>sword?</h3>
by <i>fishingfishtrout2000</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1583403904">I have recently pulled out of the closet a sword I've had for over <br/>
ten years. It appears to be a Japanese sword with some years on it.  <br/>
The scabbard is wooden and covered with leather, yet well worn.  The <br/>
sword itself has no identifying marks on it.  The handle has been <br/>
unwrapped and is bare wood.  I have looked on the internet, but have <br/>
decided that all of this is more than my mind alone can handle,  I <br/>
need some help.</div>
