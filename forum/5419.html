<h3>My 17th century tachi/katana up for auction</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1900987438">I thought I would post a link to my auction for the 17th century tachi <br/>
I have on Ebay. Currently, it only has 14 hours before it's over and <br/>
there seems to be a lot of interest.<br/>
 This is the one I believe I asked earlier for help on a translation of <br/>
the tsuba. I discovered that it is that of "teruyuki". This sword is a <br/>
nice long one (30" nagasa) that had the nakago cut down to katana <br/>
length at some point we think between 1780 and 1810.<br/>
<br/>
Have a look!<br/>
