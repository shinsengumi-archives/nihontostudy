<h3>for -t und mantis dude</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-710598520">a while back, we were talking about a fitting with what looks like a <br/>
mantis.<br/>
I recalled I made the comment that it looks like a male mantis after <br/>
sex ( meaning the head was eaten by his over zealous lover ).<br/>
<br/>
While looking at  Joly's big book ( Naunton's collection ), I come <br/>
across just that critter......... item # 4513, it's a menuki labelled <br/>
as a horned grasshopper.<br/>
Just though  you guys may like to know.<br/>
