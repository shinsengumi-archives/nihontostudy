<h3>Kogai study...</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-916511820">Kogai rank right after first ranked menuki when it comes to tosogu but after all these decades of trying to learn, I've found it very difficult to gain much understand kogai. Obviously, the best way to learn is by studying examples with peers, but those opportunities seldom present themselves, especially here in the midwest. This dilemma presented itself again since the San Francisco show. Naturally, one thinks "Goto" when it comes to fine kogai, but of course there were many other makers to consider. Mike Yamasaki's Machibori display touched upon that. Remarking on a particular kogai exhibited by Mike, I commented that if the item had not been identified as one of the artists considered a machibori smith, I would had thought it Goto work! Mike pointed out that no, that this is wrong and that is wrong for Goto. How great it would be to sit down at length with good "examples" and with somebody of knowledge to compare and point out these kantei differences! "Bits and pieces" can be learned at shows, but that's about it. <br/>
<br/>
  My question to the groups is: what sources of information have you found to be really useful -- teachable material -- that helped you understand kogai and to differenciate between the different schools who made kogai. I have a good library after all these years, but it is surprising what little information is here that helps. Certainly, good photos exist (mostly on Goto works) but there must be some material out there in publication that "compares" the work of different groups, pointing out the differences. How great it must be to be in Japan or California or New York and to have opportunities to do this with real examples!!! Any suggestions for those of us living outside of those areas? <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-641788034">Ron -- a subject close to my heart!  I have found little to no <br/>
information offering any comparisons of work.  What I have found most <br/>
helpful are the following:<br/>
'Tosogu no Kigan' by Sasano;  does have some analysis/comparisons<br/>
'Mito Koromono Shu' by Ikeda;  great pictures with his attributions<br/>
'Ko Kogai' by Ikeda;  I've never seen it but it is the best by report<br/>
also check this site out:  <br/>

go to the left hand column and you will see 2 through 8 in Japanese.<br/>
There are several great kogai in the fittings sections.<br/>
If you have any specific questions post them and perhaps we can get a <br/>
discussion going.  (Gordon has a wonderful Ko Mino collection).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2009487728">Hello Ron,<br/>
 <br/>
You are right about the volume and depth of information on main line<br/>
Goto.  I am sorry to have missed Mike's presentation on Machibori-mono.<br/>
 <br/>
In response to your call for reference material, two titles that come to<br/>
mind are:<br/>
TOSOGU MACHIBORI MEIHIN SHUSEI (FUKUSHI, 2005)<br/>
STUDIES IN KYO GOTO (Kasahara/Akimoto, 1988)<br/>
The former was the companion volume to Fukishi's 2001 Goto survey, and<br/>
the latter focuses on the 15 branch families of mainline Goto.  See<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.satcho.com/july2007">http://www.satcho.com/july2007</a> for more detail on both.<br/>
<br/>
Your call to distinguish between schools sounds like a fascinating point<br/>
of departure for an in depth study.  Next we all look forward to your<br/>
thoughts on the subject, perhaps Hartmann (2008).<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
Kind Regards,<br/>

Subject: Kogai study...<br/>
 <br/>
  Kogai rank right after first ranked menuki when it comes to tosogu but<br/>
after all these decades of trying to learn, I've found it very difficult<br/>
to gain much understand kogai. Obviously, the best way to learn is by<br/>
studying examples with peers, but those opportunities seldom present<br/>
themselves, especially here in the midwest. This dilemma presented<br/>
itself again since the San Francisco show. Naturally, one thinks "Goto"<br/>
when it comes to fine kogai, but of course there were many other makers<br/>
to consider. Mike Yamasaki's Machibori display touched upon that.<br/>
Remarking on a particular kogai exhibited by Mike, I commented that if<br/>
the item had not been identified as one of the artists considered a<br/>
machibori smith, I would had thought it Goto work! Mike pointed out that<br/>
no, that this is wrong and that is wrong for Goto. How great it would be<br/>
to sit down at length with good "examples" and with somebody of<br/>
knowledge to compare and point out these kantei differences! "Bits and<br/>
pieces" can be learned at shows, but that's about it. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-237579674">Hi Ron, an interesting question indeed. I see there have been a few <br/>
followup's here on another forum. Going through my copy of  Mito <br/>
Koromono Shu, I feel it is hard to judge a lot of what is and what isn't <br/>
in Goto or Ko Kinko without the availability of the pieces in hand.  I <br/>
think a lot of the Ko Mino work are easier to judge though simply <br/>
through the depth of carving and the subject matter. The examples in <br/>
Kinko Mino Bori show this quite clearly I think. One of the opinions on <br/>
this question I like the most is on the Choshuya Ginza website.<br/>

This article is one of there better I think in dealing with this <br/>
confusion, even though it does not actually offer an actual answer.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers and thanks for getting me thinking :-)<br/>
