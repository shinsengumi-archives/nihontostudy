<div id="ygrps-yiv-1536275004">Hi All - <br/>
<br/>
Does anyone know how blades and kodogu are to be prepared for shinsa? Do we need "paper saya" for the bare blades? What is needed for tsuba, menuki, etc.?<br/>
<br/>
See nothing written on this anywhere. Just trying to be prepared to avoid any surprises. Gordon must be enroute, but maybe Jim Gilbert is still on-line?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1914350106">Sorry Ron, I was also enroute on Monday.  We always take in bare blades, no habaki, please remove oil.  Kodogu in a box is good, but it's also perfectly OK if you don't have a box.<br/>
