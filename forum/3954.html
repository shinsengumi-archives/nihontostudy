<div id="ygrps-yiv-1221923101">I think I can answer some of this.  Just like in<br/>
swords, making your own steel stopped.  You may have<br/>
heard of "factory plate".  Basically, you could buy<br/>
the steel to make the tsuba, and many schools/artists<br/>
got away from the plate and focused more on the<br/>
decoration.  From my reading, the truly outstanding<br/>
smiths were able to do both: have a great plate while<br/>
having a superb design.  As a student of tsuba you<br/>
need to concentrate on the plate and not get<br/>
sidetracked by fancy stuff (poorly paraphrazing some<br/>
sensei)<br/>

Consider the hardness of the OLD guards eg. Onin etc., we don't see <br/>

<br/>
Note that some of the first tsuba makers to sign their names made work with just these irregularities, and their work was highly valued.  Nobuie, Hoan, Yamakichibei.<br/>
<br/>
Also note the tea wares that were in fashion at the time and very highly valued as well.  Raku, Shino, Oribe.  Worth looking up if you're not familiar with ceramics.<br/>

It is true in tea ware at the time that earlier, purely utilitarian, non-art pieces were sometimes elevated to high regard and staggering monetary value.<br/>

Questions on tsuba......<br/>
1. what's the ball park figure on amount of bones that usually appear <br/>
in iron tsuba ? Is one or two still consider " good " ( better than <br/>
none )? I have a few that show no more than two  while others are <br/>
allover the place ( mimi, that is ).<br/>
2.  I notice most bones appear on the mimi but not( usually ) the flat <br/>
surface, is it due to the forging process ? ( may be because I don't <br/>
have the fortune to own a Yamakichibai , EARLY Hoan? =(  )<br/>
3.I have notice a few tsuba that show running bones, almost like masame <br/>
hada , are they bones or just folding process that show the layers ?<br/>
4. The ko-Shoami tsuba I have in the folder also show traces of " <br/>
hada ", I notice one on the mimi that is a circle (like mokume ) which <br/>
is not bone, may be the gold nunome on the flat surfce of the rim is to <br/>
fill in those " openining edges " of mokume hada as I see nodefinite <br/>
pattern to the nunome ?<br/>

Agreed, Sharaku prices are positively Tokubetsu Juyo.<br/>
<br/>
1. One or two tekkotsu are usually more interesting than none.  Most good pieces of the types that have tekkotsu will have them distributed here and there around the rim.  Some pieces are positively bristling with them, and while it's a matter of taste it can get to be a bit much.  While one or two small bones may not have much carry much "aesthetic weight" they are a pretty good clue that the iron is not just homogenous factory plate.<br/>
<br/>
2.  Yes, they're mostly visible on the rim only, although Kanayama, Yamakichi, Hoan, etc., will show them on the face as well.  I think that it may be a function more of how the plate is finished than the forging.  If you file/grind/sand the surface down, the bones aren't going to be visible unless some later process (rust, wear, ?) brings them out.  I think that where to "put" or "leave" bones was an aesthetic choice.<br/>
<br/>
3.  There are running bones and there is masame hada.  The ones that really look like masame hada are just the layers in the iron.  I think typically if they stand out the guard was finished with some sort of etching process, or the layers were brought out by rusting.  A running bone is not as obvious or as uniform as masame hada.  It's a true tekkotsu that will be visible for a centimeter or few around the rim.  It is also probably following a higher carbon layer, but it's not as obvious as a masame hada.  It's frequently seen in early Akasaka.<br/>
<br/>
4.  Without seeing the piece I don't know.  I've never seen inlay used to fill in voids in the forging, though.  On the other hand, if some of the gold fell out, you will still see the slots cut for the inlay.  Nunome should be a definite but shallow cross hatch (cloth) pattern.  Of course hira-zogan or other techniques would be small cuts.   <br/>
<br/>
Short form answers, but I hope that gets at your questions.<br/>

When I think of masame hada in tsuba, it's a like a puff pastry crust in the rim and the sukashi.  In your ko_shoami image I think it's a weld between layers and something like masame hada.  I wouldn't consider that tekkotsu.<br/>
<br/>
The owari_mimi doesn't look like masame hada to me.  But most all tsuba forging would result in some sort of masame in the rim.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
  3.  There are running bones and there is masame hada.  The ones that really look like masame hada are just the layers in the iron.  <br/>
<br/>
  Hi Jim, ok, so this is Masame hada ?<br/>

<br/>
  and this is a running bone or a fold ?, it goes around 3 sides of the tsuba, mostly unbroken.<br/>
