It's "Shumi no Sukashi Tsuba Kogatana tsukuri" published by Kogei Shuppansha, Tokyo.  As far as I know there is no English language edition or translation available.  <<Anyone know otherwise?>>  The price on the dust jacket of my copy is Y2,000.  Penciled inside the back cover is "25," so I'm guessing that I bought it in the US for $25.  Maybe the book people on the list can track down a copy, although the price will probably be higher these days.<br/>
