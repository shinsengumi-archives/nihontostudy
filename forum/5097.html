<h3>ROKUSHO BOOK</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1471585704">Dear Nihontophiles,<br/>
<br/>
Just doing my daily trawling for all things sword related when I stumbled across this link to the book "ROKUSHO":<br/>

This Japanese website is asking 2,940 yen - on today's exchange rate that's AUD$27.67 or USD$23.81.  Of course postage is on top of that and I have no idea what that would be, however, I paid AUD$60 for it from a local collector who no longer wanted it and I was quite glad to have it.  I cannot find it on Amazon, but Wikipedia has some information on Rokusho:<br/>

<br/>
I found this altogether fascinating and, for a primarily blade man, very interesting indeed.  Some of the Wikipedia links under the listed catogories of Artistic techniques | Decorative art | Metallurgy may be of interest to many of you.  As John Yumoto once said, there is no end to study...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1359608641">I purchased a copy of this book in December of 2006. If I need <br/>
an 'adreneline' rush, I pick this one off the shelf and peruse the <br/>
contents - if I had endless amounts of money, I would purchase a few <br/>
of these 'exquisite' art objects. <br/>
