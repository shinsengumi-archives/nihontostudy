<h3>Kyo-kinko</h3>
by <i>sworddad</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1956553959">Jim, all - <br/>
<br/>
Can somebody clarify "Kyo-kinko" work, if that would "date" the work late Edo or does it simply refer to "kinko work from Kyoto?" <br/>
<br/>
I'm trying to get a good feeling of "age" for the dai-sho "dragonfly" menuki shown on Fred's site, Nihonto.com, which are now part of my collection. I am thinking these would be pretty "late Edo" but looking at some of the other "signed" solid gold menuki, maybe I'm a hundred years off on that opinion. Comments???<br/>

My understanding is that Kyo-Kinko is the new name for Waki-Goto. This would <br/>
make them a grab bag like Ko-Kinko or even Shoami. Their dates are post-Ko-<br/>
Kinko, so early Edo to Bakumatsu. There is a Kyo-Kinko book out there. I think the <br/>
title is Kyo-Kinko no Kenkyu (research into Kyo-Kinko) or something like that. Jim <br/>

  Is it then safe to say that Kyo-kanagushi is the catch-all and we <br/>
  need look to the materials and workmanship to distinguish from Kyo-<br/>
  kinko...or is it solely workmanship?<br/>

I didn't say it was hard to date Kyo-kinko, just impossible to assign to a group.  There aren't different attributions for the different parts of the Edo period.  The NTHK does assign a period within Edo for every fitting or koshirae paper:<br/>

I can't even guess at a group on the tombo menuki, and that is the way it is with the Kyo-kinko attribution.  I didn't see them in Tampa, but based on the photos they look like late Edo work.<br/>

Agreed with Gordon's earlier comment that there are plenty of early solid gold menuki, including Ko-mino and Ko-Kinko work in addition to Goto.  The recent NBTHK AB display and lecture at Tampa included several pairs of solid gold mainline Goto menuki from the Muromachi and early Edo periods.<br/>

Kyo-kinko is non-Goto (non-Mino, etc.)  kinko work from after the Momoyama<br/>
period. It is often applied to work that  is in Goto style but is not Goto<br/>
main or sideline work. Edo-kinko used to  be used similarly for work in the<br/>
style of Edo region machibori kinko  schools, but lately this is generally<br/>
lumped as "Kyo-kinko" as well. So it  truly is a grab bag, but the problem<br/>
(especially with menuki) is that there  is so much Edo period kinko work with<br/>
no unique character to it that makes  it possible to give a more specific<br/>
attribution.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, generic Edo  period kinko work of lower quality than Kyo-kinko is<br/>
attributed to  Kyo-kanagushi.<br/>

Hi Ron,<br/>
<br/>
My understanding is that  Kyo-Kinko is the new name for Waki-Goto. This would<br/>
<br/>
make them a grab  bag like Ko-Kinko or even Shoami. Their dates are post-Ko-<br/>
Kinko, so early  Edo to Bakumatsu. There is a Kyo-Kinko book out there. I<br/>
think the<br/>
title  is Kyo-Kinko no Kenkyu (research into Kyo-Kinko) or something like<br/>
that.  Jim<br/>
is probably better up on this stuff then I am.<br/>
<br/>
On on different  note, good luck to Harry. Honto ni gambatte  kudasai!!<br/>

I didn't say it was hard to date Kyo-kinko, just impossible to assign to a<br/>
group. There aren't different attributions for the different parts of the<br/>

As I've explained before, while the motif is the same, the workmanship of your tsuba is not identical.  Given that it was unsigned and had no unique characteristics, there was no more justification to assign it to a "den" than to assign every dragon or shishi Goto copy to den Goto.   Good workmanship and materials will get a slight point bonus even if the work is not distinctive enough to get a group attribution.  <br/>
<br/>
In Edo period kinko and also iron sukashi there are many very similar works with signatures from unrelated groups.  Fittings makers were turning out what would sell. <br/>
<br/>
And Milt has now burned up all of the time that I have to respond to the list for the immediate future, so you can all thank Milt for that.<br/>
