<h3>Sword Ringing</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-607021748">Hello All,<br/>
<br/>
This is going to sound like a somewhat unusual question for this group, <br/>
but it is one that I am often faced with, and I need some expert input.<br/>
<br/>
I teach a sword sport, not a martial art, and run a tiny historical <br/>
society here in the United kingdom, dedicated to the era of first <br/>
contact between Europeans and the Japanese.<br/>
<br/>
I do not own any genuine nihonto, nor do I "collect" replicas.<br/>
<br/>
Over almost the last thirty  years, I have commissioned quite a number <br/>
of totally custom made replica swords manufactured with durability, not <br/>
sharpness in mind. Meaning they are not as hard as one intended to take <br/>
an edge. I have noted that symmetrically design swords "sing" with a <br/>
clear ringing tone  when impacted, even when done gently, and that <br/>
asymmetrical ones like our katana and wakizashi do not. These instead <br/>
produce a flat "clat" like note.<br/>
<br/>
Non of the ten Japanese weapons we have had made "sing", much the same <br/>
as iaito and I presumed, that this was due to their asymmetry, which is <br/>
what I have been giving in answer to the question at our public shows <br/>
"why don't your swords ring like in the movies?" I've always thought <br/>
that the ringing tones in Japanese movies was a dubbed in sound effect, <br/>
rather than a true representation of the weapon's own nature.<br/>
<br/>
For a very long time now I have been wondering if this is incorrect, and <br/>
it is due to our weapons lack of hardness not their asymmetry. Our <br/>
current Japanese weapons tend to be in the Rockwell scale between 52-54.<br/>
<br/>
As collectors of true nihonto, can you confirm or deny this point: do <br/>
nihonto "sing" when struck? And no, I'm not expecting anyone to actually <br/>
try this on a historical weapon:-)<br/>
<br/>
For our next project, a moderately sized no-dachi, I am approaching a <br/>
new sword smith (our old one recently passed away), and I am considering <br/>
raising the hardness to circa 56-58 or maybe 60, to improve resistance <br/>
to damage, and possibly gaining a sweeter note from the blade, assuming <br/>
that my former hypothesis is in fact incorrect.<br/>
<br/>
It would be good to have a definitive answer to this question, as it <br/>
would be better than having to say that "currently, we don't know". <br/>
Filling in gaps in one's knowledge is always a good thing.<br/>
<br/>
Any help, observations etc., would be most warmly received.<br/>
<br/>
With much thanks<br/>
<br/>
