Another option is a book I use which is Kano Natsuo Meihin Shu by Ikeda.  It's a single volume published in 1972.  It covers his tsuba, kodogu, some paintings, non-sword metal work, etc.  Even a photo or two of Natsuo himself.<br/>

  There was an 8 volume Natsuo set in last June's sale at Christie's estimated<br/>
  at £1000-1500, it didn't sell. It is basically text with the illustrations<br/>
  spread throughout the set, there was however a single volume of all the<br/>
  illustrations published separately, this is the one to get if you can find<br/>
  it.<br/>

I have Kano Natsuo Meihin Shu but the volume I mentioned earlier is<br/>
apparently the one to get, it is the collected illustrations of the 8 volume<br/>
set published later in one volume by Chugoku Pearl Hambai. I have never seen<br/>
it as it is very hard to find.<br/>
