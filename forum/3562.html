<div id="ygrps-yiv-1685073044">I have always thought that the majority of these types of books we see <br/>
on auction sites and at these sort of lower prices as little more than <br/>
novelty books. Is this incorrect ?. I would have thought that with <br/>
technological advances, another 200 years or so of study and probably <br/>
access to more material, we would have the best books available to us <br/>
now. I would also imagine that any books written with authority in those <br/>
days would be rare and worth a lot of money.<br/>
<br/>
And I don't know why, but I imagine all the good data is on scrolls. <br/>
LOL, too many movies maybe ?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1785690544">yes of course, but that's not really what I meant. We have had more time <br/>
to find more manuscripts and books, scrolls or whatever. Also, Some of <br/>
these scholars of ye olden times may not have had access to books on the <br/>
other side of the country ( just speculation ) I don't know about that <br/>
but it would be plausible I think. As time goes on, we acquire more <br/>
information and learn more and more. I am sure the printing press and <br/>
then the Internet have made massive advances in the acquisition of <br/>
knowledge.<br/>
<br/>
So, to clarify,  I am not dismissing this and suggesting it is of little <br/>
worth because it's old. The line of thought was that it is more likely <br/>
that this is a copy, and one has to question it's accuracy ( your <br/>
original question ).  As I said in my last post. I think these types of <br/>
books, the originals, would be locked away and under key.<br/>
<br/>
I am working and typing, I could never manage two things at once LOL. <br/>
Sorry if my thoughts are confusing.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I'm sure Milt means the Kanzan books.<br/>
<br/>
It's not surprising that Kanzan used these sources, as almost all<br/>
Japanese scholarship is simply repeating what the previous authorities<br/>
had to say. Anything else would be disrespectful, right?<br/>
<br/>
I have a couple of these kinds of books. The fact that they were<br/>
printed means they were not "secret," even 150 years ago. Much of the<br/>
information gets repeated by Wada in his scarce 1913 companion volume<br/>
to the Furukawa collection book, which is currently being serialized<br/>
for us in the NCJSC newletter  (Joly's translation, edited and<br/>
annotated by Alan Harvie.)<br/>
<br/>
Akiyama and Torigoye are two that did not follow the conventional line<br/>
of thought, and if you've been reading what Haynes - who's in that<br/>
"lineage" -  has been writing on the subject of Japanese scholarship,<br/>
you know what I'm talking about. Sasano was another who colored<br/>
outside the lines, but his work has already been discounted by the<br/>
powers that be.<br/>

page 107 of the Goto 17 generation book/catalog.<br/>
