I had an unsigned guard with a Kaneie style design a long time ago that had iron and iroe like this.  I'm not sure if it was by the Saga group or by someone else.<br/>
<br/>
For Jakushi you'd expect to see nunome zogan.  It looks a bit better than the so-called "Mito-Shoami" shiiremono, but is probably in that bag.  I have followed up on that and I agree with Cary that there is no proof of the existence of a Mito Shoami group.  It was a handy label for the auction business, but I think we should avoid it going forward.  I still think that those guards probably do have an association with the Shoami because of the similarity of some of them to signed pieces like this one:<br/>

  question...... what schoo ?<br/>
  1. Jakushi ( on a good day ) ?<br/>
  2. Mito ?<br/>
  3. the all purpose Shoami ?<br/>
<br/>
  This would be a good example of " Mito Shoami " before we realise <br/>
  that school may or may not exist   ?<br/>
