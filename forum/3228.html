<div id="ygrps-yiv-59641956">To clarify for those who haven't seen it, this is more than just a reprint of Albert Yamanaka's original work.  Paul Allman took apart a set of the original newsletters and rearranged them according to a logical table of contents.  The first two volumes are as easily accessed as the Nihonto Koza or similar encyclopedia.  <br/>
<br/>
Volume I covers Koto, arranged by the classical road system.<br/>
<br/>
Volume II is Shinto and Shin-Shinto, followed by History of the Japanese Sword, Identification of Nihonto through Shape, and Definition of Nihonto and its Nomenclature.<br/>
<br/>
Volume III includes Historical figures, Famous Swords in Japanese History, Kokuho, Missing Kokuho and Juyo Bijutsu and Kyoho Meibutsu Cho<br/>
<br/>
Volume IV continues Kyoho Meibutsu Cho, several articles by others, the Tokugawa Jikki and an extensive compilation of Random Thoughts.<br/>
<br/>
Some of the most interesting material is in later two volumes, but an index would greatly enhance their usability.<br/>
<br/>
The Allman version came out over ten years ago, but was "off the market" until recently.  I see that latest offering does not include binding of the four volumes, so be sure to get them into some sort of binding before the pages get mixed up. <br/>

    Hi:<br/>
    The Yamanaka Newsletter is second to none as a useful source of comprehensive and detailed information on the Japanese sword - coming as a newsletter it has certain natural limitations of easy use, ie, it isn't easy to use, but it is virtually without peer.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-298334737">Hi:<br/>
 I did not know that the Yamanaka Newsletter had been reorganized. It was its serial and disjointed format that made it awkward to use, but its comprehensiveness more than made up for that. Also, the late Robert M. Lewert put out a quite complete and reasonably accurate index of the NL in its original form, so if one had that it was never a probelm to access. Thanks for the additional information Jim. <br/>

Number 482 was a Myochin tsuba with a circular cross section rim and a design of two large diamond shapes at 12:00 and 6:00.  That's the only thing similar in your group.  I know the owner, so I'm guessing it's the one you're thinking of.<br/>
<br/>
I've seen the spiral motif used on a guard signed Tadatoki, and as Rich said the insect is often seen in Akasaka sukashi.  I don't think Akasaka is a bad call. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-617894041">ooohh, yagu, that's teasing :-). Tell us more......<br/>
<br/>
Thanks Jim, I guess the Mimi was what threw me, though my Tadatoki <br/>
mokume tsuba's mimi is as square as my last assistant, and that's <br/>
square. I think the sharpness of the sukashi is Akasaka-ish, as is the <br/>
design as a whole. I thought Akao because of it's overall boldness and <br/>
the fact that they were copying Akasaka along with Tosa Myochin and visa <br/>
versa at the later stages of the Edo period.<br/>
<br/>
Though, from the photo's, I would think this a bit older than late Edo ?.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers<br/>

I took the tsuba to shinsa, but may have not submitted<br/>
it. I believe the owner made a substitution (he had<br/>
only so many slots and given me more items than he had<br/>
slots). Same owner as the Myochin.<br/>
<br/>
The design is exactly the same as Rich's, but it did<br/>
not feel Akasaka. The mimi on Akasaka usually feels<br/>
more full, rounded. Then the actual plate on the tsuba<br/>
was ~perfectly~ flat and the sukashi so crisp in<br/>
execution that it felt almost machined precise in<br/>
execution.<br/>
    I mentally ruled out Akasaka, and was curious to<br/>
see the shinsa results on it. The fact that I don't<br/>
would point towards either (a) early senility or (b)<br/>
that this was the one substituted out.<br/>
<br/>
Jim, (sidenote) at the time I was surprised at the<br/>
Myochin call on the other tsuba. I would have thought<br/>
that it ended up in some group I was less familiar<br/>
with. Interesting tsuba.<br/>
<br/>
Any preview on the Yagyu exhibit for those<br/>
international listeroos that won't get to see it?<br/>
