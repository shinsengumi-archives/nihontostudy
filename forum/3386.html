<h3>Another kodzuka ...</h3>
by <i>drjohnplissenden</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1900403168">I have read somewhere - I cannot remember where - that Goto menuki <br/>
have sometimes been mounted as the decoration on kodzuka or kogai.  Is <br/>
the kodzuka illustrated in my photo album JPL one such?<br/>
<br/>
It is of good quality shakudo, with a worn, horizontal nanako surface <br/>
within a raised rim.  The decoration is a raised shakudo boss with a <br/>
circumferential nanako decoration.  This rests upon a gold base, and <br/>
depicts six pawlonia mon of the 3-5-3 variety, with a seventh set deep <br/>
at the centre.  This one is less worn than the other six, and is very <br/>
detailed in its execution.  The whole sits upon a silver ?shuttle.  <br/>
The reverse is of polished shakudo, and the kodzuka is unsigned.<br/>

<br/>
It is most likely not a single menuki, but it is an applied piece. The ruler<br/>
is the type used in calligraphy and is a common late Muromachi to Momoyama<br/>
period design. It is a rather nice piece. Goto kiri mon have identifying<br/>
punch marks, but your photos are too small to confirm them.<br/>
