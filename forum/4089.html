<h3>Brass Zogan</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1742024893">Hello All, I was just reading the article by John Berta dealing with <br/>
brass inlay in tsuba. Some fine examples were included in the article. <br/>
When I started to read it I was hoping, aha, maybe I''ll finally be <br/>
able to peghole a simple tsuba I have. I'm afraid the tsuba is too <br/>
simple and displays too few characteristics for me to attribute it to <br/>
any school. So, I leave it up to you all. I hope someone may enlighten <br/>
me. Thanks, John<br/>
