<h3>Mihara mei</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-672669343">Hi Mediator san - <br/>
<br/>
Well, it's good to know people are still alive out there. I started to wonder if I missed something on the news that caused a melt-down of the sword groups or something. Hmmm...let's see what I can toss out there to talk about. <br/>
<br/>
Anyone ever studied the "dating" of Bingo Mihara swords using the full "Bingo" province name v/s the abreviated form of "Bishu?" I recall this being mentioned in NBTHK's Token Bijutsu a decade or so ago. One reason I ask is that I'm (eventually) going to write something for the JSS/US on a couple Bingo Mihara swords. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1401391883">Hi Ken - <br/>
<br/>
Yes, there are some beautiful swords that came out of Bingo Mihara area. Many mumie "Rai" swords are labeled "Mihara" by (what I think of as) conservative shinsa judges which of course speaks well for their workmanship. I own only one Mihara sword but it is a beauty, a "masculine" hirazukuri ko-wakizashi by a smith named Masachika. A sword friend found it in Oklahoma City area back around late 1970s and had it polished (beautifully) by Kajihara. It received Koshu Tokubetsu Keicho (so-called "high green" paper) from the NBTHK in 1979 but we never really figured out its age. Yamanaka insisted it was Nambokucho but my friend felt it more mid-Muromachi; today, I have not convinced myself one way or the other. My friend got disgusted with sword people in the mid-1980s and sold off his small but nice collection. I was able to purchase this blade at that time but nothing else, thanks to limited funds during that time of "raising family" years. Always wanted to let's say, "honor" this sword with an article, but being indecisive about its age...well...here it sits, unshared. I think it is time.<br/>
