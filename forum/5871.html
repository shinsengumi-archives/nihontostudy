<h3>Cutting down to size</h3>
by <i>maiorian</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-934400227">This sounds like a sensible way to ship polearms:<br/>
<br/>
The overseas delivery for very long items by Air Delivery is limited to 1.5 metres in length. As it can be expensive to deliver single articles by shipping them Sea Freight, some over-long items are not prudent to send abroad. Pole arms can, however, have the shaft cut in half and very simply re-affixed at the destination [either personally, by the buyer, or by a basic carpenter]. This has been the accepted method of transporting pole arms for many, many, years and is perfectly suitable and effective.<br/>
<br/>
This is from The Lanes Armoury in Brighton, UK, I have never heard of this before but then I don't ship yari.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1636081613">Errr, I'd be horrified if any polearm arrived to me cut in half, let <br/>
alone a collectors item. I suspect if you delve a little deeper, they <br/>
likely make replicas that just hang on the wall for a customer base that <br/>
is prepared to sacrifice utility & authenticity for cheap to deliver & <br/>
looks good hanging there.<br/>
