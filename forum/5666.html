<h3>In memory...</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-502293389">Word has come in that two patriarchs of the sword world have left us. An email was received today announcing that Dean Hartley died yesterday. Also in today's mail, the NCJSC newsletter announced the death of Bill Edick last week. <br/>
<br/>
Bill, a super nice gentleman, was one of my first acquaintances when I entered the sword world. It was always so neat to see Bill and his son Jack together at the San Francisco shows. Bill continued to have a table full of "goodies" -- remember those wonderful abumi he displayed? -- at the show and always had a smile and a good word to share with everyone. <br/>
<br/>
It seems like Dean was always there, a fixture of the sword scene and another old friend from those early days of studying swords. Dean's exposure to and knowledge of swords was an inspiration to me personally, a goal to strive for. <br/>
<br/>
I'm sure more tributes will be written to remember these two founders. For now, I feel sad to learn of their passing and will sit and recall the many fond memories of my friendship with them. Condolences to their families...<br/>
