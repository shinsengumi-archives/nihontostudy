<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-446902922">All-<br/>
	I am a member of most of the organizations concerned and I have to say <br/>
I have had a very different experience. The very first person I went to <br/>
was a dealer, who as Harry has pointed out, risked the safety and <br/>
security of his family and collection by welcoming into his home a <br/>
complete stranger. I didn't get cookies and milk but did get the honest <br/>
appraisal I had asked for and an introduction to people who could <br/>
further me in my areas of interest. He didn't know it then but it was a <br/>
life-changing meeting for me.<br/>
	For some years I was reluctant to join the clubs because I was <br/>
concerned that a newbie wouldn't be able to keep up and might be <br/>
unwelcome. Not the case however, I have learned a great deal from every <br/>
one of the members of my club and we are always happy to see new faces. <br/>
New faces with or without stuff in hand I might add. You are all <br/>
invited to join us at the NCJSC anytime you are in town and your <br/>
schedule permits.<br/>
	I write travelogues and grade school level essays on subjects of <br/>
interest to me for our newsletter. It was several years after I joined <br/>
that I took up the challenge to contribute. I didn't know much then, <br/>
still don't now but I love a good tale and have a hard time resisting <br/>
an empty pulpit.I am also unafraid of being wrong. Not sure this is a <br/>
talent but we all pitch in with with those skills we bring with us to <br/>
make the club the best we can. I have seen some great changes in the <br/>
last ten years and fully expect more as some of us newbies start to <br/>
flex our muscles.<br/>
	The question was what is wrong and what can we do to fix those <br/>
problems. Having studied briefly in Japan I find little wrong with what <br/>
is happening there, education, study, and publication continue. There <br/>
is a world of new info published each month, there are kantei-kai and <br/>
taikai providing unparalleled opportunities for growth. With the birth <br/>
of the American Branch of the NBTHK alot of that will now be available <br/>
to us unlucky enough to live here in the land of the 9.99 pizza. Ok <br/>
membership could be cheaper, but would be worth it at double the cost.<br/>
	We don't do enough here to spread the word and bring in new members. <br/>
Visits to local schools ( as a list member suggested awhile back), a <br/>
table at Martial arts tournaments, more advertising and other ways of <br/>
reaching out are all possible. I for one would like to see more <br/>
translations, but we have the NBTHK and the NTHK and soon translations <br/>
from Dr. Robson from the JSSUS, what isn't being transmitted? Thats <br/>
gist for another thread perhaps, but it seems the material is being <br/>
made available and each publication/organization has their area. It <br/>
ain't coming out fast enough, I agree, afterall I went to Japan to try <br/>
to learn the lan-gauge and accelerate the learning process but it is <br/>
coming out.<br/>
	I also want to see older material rehashed, wouldn't it be great if we <br/>
could do an oshigata issue, going back to the original "masters" I <br/>
would love to see biographies of long time collectors, taped interviews <br/>
and a history of our clubs. We have a "convention", it is in San <br/>
Francisco. If there is a beginner topic you want to learn about the <br/>
club is always looking for monthly topics tell us what areas you want <br/>
to explore.<br/>
	Mentoring? certainly can't argue with that, wish I had one myself. <br/>
Since I have a voice, thanks to this medium, I always try to answer <br/>
newerbie questions and always help folks who contact me off line and I <br/>
have received lots of help from other listeros myself. Again my <br/>
experience has been a positive one. This medium you ask? Yes lots to <br/>
say on that but will make that a separate thread.<br/>
	Anyway what's up is,is that interest is down, membership is down and <br/>
the time is ripe for a small group of motivated individuals to <br/>
revolutionize these clubs and this study. Maybe all we need is you, I <br/>
am here already and I am ready to create the future...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1515064175">One way to start recruiting people that are obviously into the hobby is to <br/>
e-mail new user IDs on ebay that are bidding on swords and fittings.  I've had a <br/>

more information.  I'm not sure if any of them ever join but it is worth the <br/>

The real problem of this hobby is the expense.  You have to have a good <br/>
income and a good deal of time to learn.  Most young people don't have the money or <br/>
care to spend the time to learn (and I'm not some old man bashing young <br/>

<h3>Re: the state of things What&#39;s Next?</h3>
by <i>soshuju</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1947141406">All-<br/>
	Forgive me if you have heard this rant before, but I think this the <br/>
most important challenge that faces us;<br/>
	 I can't agree with anyone who dismisses computer and  internet <br/>
technology as quick fixes or spoon food for Gen X-ers.  John Yumoto <br/>
himself said the computer was the future of nihonto study and no matter <br/>
how much info we make available here, the hard work will still have to <br/>
be done in hand one blade at a time.<br/>
	There is honestly no reason we cannot have all our references <br/>
downloaded and indexed in an online library. What I wouldn't give to <br/>
have just three books on my PDA! Electronic paper? I'll take a sheaf! <br/>
Seeing what others have done with Tosho and what Darcy has done with <br/>
his database I wonder if I shouldn't have studied "computer" instead of <br/>
Japanese.<br/>
	Whats missing? What would do the most good? Nagayama without a doubt. <br/>
I use the Japanese but even when I use the Eigo I have days when I <br/>
can't find a particular smith even though I KNOW he is in there. <br/>
Computer would solve that. The Meikan? absolutely if it is just a <br/>
hobby, and you are not obsessed like me, then you want a quick <br/>
reference to names and dates. This is the book and with minimal <br/>
Japanese it's secrets can be unlocked. I would venture a great deal of <br/>
useful info is already in print, from the JSSUS and other US clubs. I <br/>
expect it would be easier to get them on board with a project to <br/>
update, collate and disseminate all the info contained in those old <br/>
newsletters.<br/>
	Authentication? Here's a big complaint. Newbiles have to visit dealers <br/>
and silverbacks or even Japan to get an appraisal. Even were everything <br/>
we now have translated on line, the eye of an expert could never be <br/>
replaced. The clubs that do shinsa now, could save time and effort <br/>
offering internet appraisals. Charging a nominal fee for reviewing <br/>
scans and rubbings, this could be credited against a full shinsa <br/>
submission. You'll have to deal with more junk on the whole, but a lot <br/>
less in person and the whole process would feel more accessible to the <br/>
hobbyist.<br/>
	The tricks, scams, flaws and pitfalls could all be compiled on a <br/>
single website. There could be a known fake database, to help prevent <br/>
future frauds. There will still be people who don't bother to visit it <br/>
and some people won't listen no matter how many times or ways you <br/>
explain "fatal flaw" or "fake signature". So again the internet will be <br/>
a big help but it won't be able to save everyone.<br/>
	Lectures and study groups. Martial arts dojo bring "experts" over for <br/>
seminars all the time. There is no reason we cannot. We have Dr Robson <br/>
of the NTHK making annual presentations of the kind and quality seen in <br/>
Japan, others have come in the past, why not invite them over? The <br/>
argument against seems to be the money. Not enough members willing to <br/>
pay for an evening with Fukunaga Suiken? Well Rock stars do online <br/>
interviews why not the stars of nihonto? Hire a translator, sit at a <br/>
terminal and rock out. Better yet set up a video conference, don't <br/>
allow questions just broadcast the kantei kai, or let Sensei talk for <br/>
an hour each week on whatever he likes. However as Clive has mentioned <br/>
without your alls support...<br/>
	I have talked about virtual swords one could hold in a sensor-gloved <br/>
hand and examine to your hearts desire and  a slew of virtual Sensei <br/>
giving lectures on each of these. Check out e-kokuho at the Tokyo <br/>
National Museum, virtual swords presented at various magnifications and <br/>
in different light, excellent photography. We aren't so very far from <br/>
this but can't we digitize the old lectures of John Yumoto? Put them up <br/>
as audio files that play with subtitles? Digitize what film we have of <br/>
him and others, add updated graphics, background notes, subtitles, <br/>
oshigata and still photos?<br/>
	Shijo kantei! Why not a for fee monthly kantei? The same swords that <br/>
are in the magazine. This way overseas members don't have to fool with <br/>
postage and have more time to crunch the problem before the deadline. <br/>
Create a new category of e-member, $15 or $20 bucks a year for a <br/>
passcode to access the members only pages allowing them to try their <br/>
hand at kantei . Virtual shinsa could be a priveledge for only those <br/>
with a full or e-membership and passcode. Member profiles could be part <br/>
of the site. Imagine your picture and list of wants or area of <br/>
expertise listed for any and all interested parties to see. Friendships <br/>
and business contacts could be made, you might even place that name <br/>
with a face you remember from the taikai.This is where we are headed, <br/>
we only have to wait to see who does it first.<br/>
	Wanting to see all these advances, I can barely afford to pay all the <br/>
dues, but then cannot afford to let any of these great clubs fade away. <br/>
If  it is not your club it can be, join up now. Waiting for the reform <br/>
and withholding your dues will likely only slow the change. Plunk down <br/>
the money and be active and we can have all the things on our wish <br/>
list. Answer the door Neo!<br/>

There are (or at least were) audio tapes of some of Yumoto's lectures...  I think that the JSS used to have these available for loan through their media library.  I don't know if they are still available there, but that would be a good place to start.  I also do not know who owns the rights to the material.<br/>
<br/>
The Tampa group made a videotape of Tanobei-sensei's lectures at their show earlier this year.  Again, I don't know what kind of licensing arrangement would be required, but that trail should be fresh.<br/>

       Indeed, all you say is quite correct. With the average price of a blank cd under $1 and a DVD under $4 ( i'm talking ozy $ here ), the oly real expence would be shipping. And with online, as long as the file sizes are kept managable then they are basically free. We have software here that produes flash files that make files of good quality at about 1 - 2 meg per minute with audio and this is quite acceptable I think. Of course the joy of CD/DVD is it is either full screen or close to it.<br/>
<br/>
Either way, it's all good and would offer a lot to everyone, even as a reminder to those who went to the lectures or shows.<br/>

I don't follow eBay, but I bet that your figure of 20% is optimistic.  I think that your idea is really good, though.  Anyone who can point new eBay bidders toward the lists and clubs will probably do more good than us 40 year old types sitting around as moderators and presidents.  Everyone go to it!  Bottom up efforts are usually better than the top down ones anyhow.  I'm going to start trying it.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Gah flash! GAH! GAH, I say, what filth :-).<br/>
<br/>
Honestly it is most appropriately done in MPEG4. Give people pointers to the<br/>
appropriate codecs to install.<br/>
<br/>
Release it on a CD. DVD for those who want to watch it on a TV set.<br/>
<br/>
Ideally though it just stays online so nobody has to putz around with<br/>
burning copies of media. <br/>
<br/>
But please, no flash.<br/>

Yes, I understood that you plan to host it for free.  I started pulling JSSUS issues at random to find a mention of the Yumoto tapes.  I don't see it in any recent issues... the first one that I happened to hit was from July/August of '93.  That lists 11 cassettes of wide-ranging material on history, blades, fittings, kantei, tools, book reviews, etc.  It outlines the contents of each tape.  If it is of any help I can scan it for you.  I hope that the tapes still exist.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, I happened to see Thomas C. Helm of San Francisco, CA listed among the new members in the September-October '93 issue.  Time flies.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  I'll do it for free with whatever info I can get my hands on.<br/>
<br/>
  As long as I don't go over my current bandwidth limit, I don't care<br/>
  how many people leech it off my server and I'm T3 class. <br/>
<br/>
  I will follow up with Barry Hennick when I see him, and I will ask the<br/>
  people in the Florida club.<br/>

I'm going to seriously pursue this. I will be seeing Arnold Freznel and<br/>
Barry Hennick on the 13th of December and we're going to discuss putting<br/>
material online.<br/>
<br/>
The NTHK through John Prough has offered info as well.<br/>
<br/>
I just put some more money into hosting today to be devoted strictly to<br/>
free educational nihonto related content. I registered nkb.ca and bought<br/>
a new hosting contract for it.<br/>
<br/>
I'm going to move over the data I have now, and hopefully expand the<br/>
offerings.<br/>
<br/>
I put it up as its own domain for a couple reasons, first to put some<br/>
space between myself and the site, as on my general-purpose site I have<br/>
a sword (with more to come soon) and some tsuba for sale, and I would<br/>
like there to be a clean and clear gap of daylight between the two.<br/>
<br/>
I'm going to write my letter to the Florida Token Kai after I move over<br/>
the NKB database and files to the new server.<br/>
