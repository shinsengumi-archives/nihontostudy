<h3>Dr. Torigoye hako-gaki</h3>
by <i>sworddad</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1762304762">Looking at an old hako-gaki by he late Dr. Torigoye, he used two seals; one seal is a square "name" seal and the other the round "has a bird on it" seal. Does anyone remember when he used these two seals? I seem to remember one being used in Japan, the other when writing hako-gaki outside of Japan, but I'm unsure of that memory.<br/>
<br/>
I have a notation on the "square" sealed box, "Zaiya" and wonder if that's a rating level of his. <br/>

Thanks<br/>

As I recall, the round seal with the bird was used for hako-gaki written<br/>
outside Japan. I also remember someone explaining the little marks on the<br/>
right side of Dr. Torigoye's kao signifying his evaluation of quality or<br/>
value: one mark "1st class," 2 marks "2nd class."<br/>
<br/>
Of course hako-gaki, like origami, are still just an opinion. I had a tsuba<br/>
with a hako-gaki by Dr. Torigoye attributing it to Dai-go-ro, with his "1st<br/>
class" notation on the kao. I sold it to someone who found it in a book<br/>
attributed to Akasaka, and the NBTHK gave it a paper as Akasaka.<br/>
<br/>
So it goes.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1602927003">Hi Ron,<br/>
<br/>
We had quite a decent write up on the NMB about the art names and<br/>
seals he used.<br/>
Instead of typing it all out (and there were quite a few pics) I would<br/>
refer you to the following link:<br/>

Check out especially the second page..post by Paul (Myochin)<br/>
Hope this helps.<br/>
