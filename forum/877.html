<h3>Mito Shoami - not</h3>
by <i>yamaimojg</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-561152766">BTW,<br/>
I asked Hagihara-sensei whether he had ever seen anything with a Mito Shoami signature or any record of an attribution to Mito Shoami.  He said no, but of course that he had seen signed Aizu Shoami work.<br/>
<br/>
We didn't get any of the Shoami-style shiiremono tsuba at this shinsa, but in past shinsa they were simply rejected as being mass produced without any comment as to their origin.<br/>
