<h3>Akasaka ???</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1100219824">Greetings all, my attempt at what seems to be a weekly tsuba kantei I have going with myself. <br/>
<br/>
Is this an Akasaka guard ?.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
The Hitsu-ana don't look correct for any of the main schools, at least I can't remember seeing Akasaka with Kogai Hitsu-ana on both sides. The ones I have seen have either a Kogai Hitsu-ana or Kozuka Hitsu-ana on one side and a Hitsu-ana that is part of the shape of the overall design for the opposing Hitsu-ana or, they have the standard configuration or both Kozuka Hitsu-ana in a more rounded form.<br/>
<br/>
Also, the seppa dai looks a little uniform to me and may be right for one of the later works but not the early stuff. <br/>
<br/>
I was wondering if this may be a Hayashi guard ???.<br/>
<br/>
cheers all<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2110008511">Hey Rich,<br/>
    I really like this idea of a weekly tsuba kantei.  Please keep it up.  As <br/>
for my thoughts.  It could be a later students work from the Akasaka school, <br/>
but dimensions would be helpful (e.g., thickness at seppa dai and rim).  Also <br/>
a better look at the rim too.  Do you know what the design represents?  <br/>
