<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
This year I will be doing kodogu and koshirae with Jim's help. I will<br/>
certainly have a number of pieces that have genuine uttori overlays with me.<br/>
So, we can continue the Tampa discussion in SF. I have expanded my Ko-Mino<br/>
collection, so there will be a chance to compare Ko-Mino, Ko-Kinko and<br/>
Ko-Goto pieces as well. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1876095111">Looking forward to fondling some early fittings with uttori next week. Will bring a few menuki examples along for discussion, including a few that "appear" to have uttori overlay but I suspect, are something else, another technique. We shall see, eh? <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-417361775">Hi Ron,<br/>
Yes, I'll be there and I'm looking forward to the discussion.  I'll bring along a pair of ko-Mino menuki that have slight loss to the uttori that makes the way it was attached particularly clear.  Maybe Saturday afternoon before the NBTHK American branch meeting would be a good time.<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of which, the American branch decided to add fittings study to their meeting agenda.  It'll be a good study opportunity for sword fittings students attending the Tampa, Chicago and/or SF shows.    I uploaded a membership form to the group file page at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://tinyurl.com/5xeyy">http://tinyurl.com/5xeyy</a> for anyone interested.  The topic at Tampa will be Kanayama, Owari and Ko-Shoami tsuba.<br/>
