<h3>Kozuke kuni smith</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2121657162">Hi all - <br/>
<br/>
Here is another place-name I'm trying to understand, without success. This is a dated (Bunka 7 - 1810 if I read the script correctly) wakizashi signed: Kozuke kuni (place-name?) ju (smith?). Yahoo photo links are:<br/>

<br/>
  These photos are labeled "Kozuke kuni 1 and 2" (earlier question's links/photos are labeled "Ron STL")<br/>
<br/>
  I've searched, again unsuccessfully, for a town-name in Kozuke province that might have these characters in the name, but the first character I can not pronounce; the second looks like "mura" but could also be pronounced differently. Anybody have any suggestions???<br/>
<br/>
  Notice I've also left the smith's name unknown. The rubbing simply did not pick it up clearly enough. It could be something like Sadahiro with the final character being the kanji for "katana" which--and it seems somebody mentioned this several months ago--refers to the maker of the sword. Anyway, here is another excercise for you to entertain yourselves with and hopefully, help to answer my questions about this mei.  Thanks!<br/>
<br/>
