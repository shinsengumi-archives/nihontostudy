<div id="ygrps-yiv-1390825677">Hello Jim and all,<br/>
<br/>
I would expect that warfare or a specific battle would have many different<br/>
'combat scenario's' besides what we have read as being typical or proper (by<br/>
the book). However, I agree with the thinking that the bow was the primary<br/>
weapon way back in the Kamakura period. How often did a Samurai on horseback<br/>
actually use his sword?<br/>
<br/>
For running down a fleeing opponent or getting close with another mounted<br/>
warrior, especially one still holding his bow, a light, long, and curved sword<br/>
is very effective. If you are using a 3 foot long sword from horseback, its<br/>
weight is a prime factor. With my left hand on the reins, I would want my sword<br/>
to be light and easy to draw, hold, and use with my right arm and hand. Such a<br/>
sword enables one to deliver many slashing blows without getting tired. A<br/>
leather tsuba certainly didn't add extra weight, or affect the balance of the<br/>
weapon to any great degree. I would never be aiming for my opponents tsuba or<br/>
his helmet bowl if fighting from horseback. I don't think I would get close to<br/>
anybody until I used up all my arrows. Perhaps then I would draw my sword.<br/>
Those fellows on the ground with the long nagamaki's scare me (and especially<br/>
my horse a lot), but if I can get swiftly past the blade, or they turn their<br/>
backs on me, watch out, they are most likely dead.<br/>
<br/>
As Dennis Miller often says: "....and I could be wrong about this."<br/>

Good point.  We have iron sukashi, iron sukashi with hira zogan and gilded yamagane tsuba from as early as the Kofun period.  We also have many decorated copper alloy tachi tsuba from the Heian through Muromachi periods.  No doubt that the metal tsuba have more "show potential" and certain functional advantages, but hide tsuba appear to have been the guards of choice on fighting tachi from at least the late Heian through Nanbokucho periods.  Metal sukashi and inlay were certainly known at the time but apparently not widely chosen for combat.  Richard M. may have hit on the extreme light weight as being the primary advantage while still providing "good enough" protection for the hand under the prevailing fighting conditions described by Pat, Tom and Gordon.  I'd like to hear more ideas...<br/>

Would flash and style have had much to do with the introduction of metal tsuba ?, I am sure that the beauty of a Gold and Silver inlayed piece or a well carved sukashi tsuba would have turned some heads as apposed to a lacquered hide tsuba.<br/>

Yes lacquer itself does indeed have glue properties.<br/>
As anyone who's done lacquer work will readily tell<br/>
you that you have to be VERY careful of spillover<br/>
otherwise you will be chipping whatever you were<br/>
working on off of whatever they were drying on. Hell<br/>
even paint will work as a glue in a pinch, you just<br/>
have to let it dry properly is all. But by far lacquer<br/>
will have a much tougher outer shell than any paint I<br/>
know of. Especially if it's built up in layers as I'm<br/>
sure these tsuba were.<br/>

I'll be interested to hear how yours turns out.  The one I made has continued to dry and is now pretty difficult to flex.  Mine is a three layer, which is the simplest construction I've seen.  Most are 4 or 5 layer and I've seen one six layer guard.  I think that crossing the grain makes sense.  I couldn't detect a  consistent grain in the rawhide I used, so I don't know if the layers are optimally arranged. <br/>
<br/>
The lacquered examples I've seen didn't show signs of lacquering between the layers.  Many of the early ones at Oyamazumi have delaminated, so whatever the glue was, it failed at some point over the last 800 years.  Many of those guards show no trace of lacquer at all, while the saya and tsuka of the same koshirae are still intact.  I don't know if the tsuba were not lacquered originally, or if the lacquer was not as stable on the leather as it is on wood.  Maybe the leather expands and contracts more with changes in temperature and/or humidity causing the lacquer to flake off.<br/>
<br/>
The Nanbokucho era nerikawa tsuba were in better shape.  I don't know if that's because of lesser age or an improvement in manufacturing technique or something else.<br/>
