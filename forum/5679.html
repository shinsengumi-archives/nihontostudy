<h3>Chicago chit-chat anyone?</h3>
by <i>sworddad</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-219318348">Hi all - <br/>
<br/>
Gosh, so little traffic on the various "lists" of late, is anybody still interested in swords and tosogu these days? The Chicago show if upon us this coming weekend. Anybody bringing anything particularly exciting for sale or just show-and-tell??? I do know the NBTHK-American branch will have an exciting Horikawa school display for our fondling pleasure. My contribution will be a large and exciting naginata by Horikawa Kunimichi with horimono. Bob Benson has been busy rounding up a number of great examples of the school's works, so it should be both an educational and visually pleasing display. <br/>
<br/>
I'm not sure just yet what I'll bring for sharing. That depends on my level of energy, but most likely I'll have a couple of Juyo daito along and maybe a recently polished gendai naginata, a rarity. So stop by and say hello and don't be bashful about asking to see these beautiful treasures! They're what it's all about! Nothing very "fresh" for my table, but nice things irregardless, and all "open for offers" if at all possible. I'll have our latest KTK 2009 publication available and maybe a number of excellent (an somewhat pricey) tosogu and sword related books, too. <br/>
<br/>
Any signed/dated Jirotaro swords or tsuba coming??? Remember me. <br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1348092583">Thanks guys. For those unfamiliar with our annual KTK (Kokusai Tosogu Kai) publication, these are high quality printed hard-cover (with slip cover) books showing photographs with descriptions of high quality fittings (the best) selected from members' collections. The KTK is a small private international club of tosogu collectors. Members fund these publications as as a means of supporting our organization (there are no dues) while sharing knowledge of fine tosogu. Each member is expected to buy (10) copies of these limited printings (usually 400 copies) while others will buy twenty or thirty copies and resell them. Myself, I've been charging $90 pp to U.S. addresses which is, considering the cost of the photography and final printing, plus shipping. Some members do not even try to break even; myself, I prefer to not particularly take a loss, but that's just me. Anyway, that's a little background on these KTK publications. The 2010 edition is already being worked on and will be bigger and better than before, from preliminary indications. Feel free to contact me privately at: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:swords@...">swords@...</a> if interested in buying a copy. Those outside of the U.S.A. can buy them cheaper (because of shipping costs) from local members. <br/>
