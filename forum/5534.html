<h3>Emailing: Shintogo</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-85804195">Hi all - <br/>
<br/>
Silly thing to be pondering late night before driving to Tampa, but...I'm curious about a red lacquer attribution on a little hirazukuri ko-wakizashi that's here. It looks like it's an attribution to Shintogo Kuni--- (not mitsu?) and the ura seems to be a Honami inscription. Anybody care to translate this inscription tonight??? Poor sword has been sandpapered but is in interesting kinko fitted mounts. If not Kunimitsu, who then???  Just a last ditch exercise that would be nice to solve. <br/>
