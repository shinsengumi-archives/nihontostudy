<h3>Help with tsuba please - Yoshitame engraver?</h3>
by <i>lshobie</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-840307616">Hi there,<br/>
<br/>
I have a tsuba that I am trying to do some research on, it has an <br/>
elaborate grassscript type writing on it that I have had <br/>
translated.   It turns out that it is a haiku peom written by <br/>
Baishitsu (1769-1852), and it means reads "Various impressions are <br/>
given to me every time the scenery of the season where the plum tree <br/>
blooms is seen". <br/>
<br/>
There is also asignature which I am told is the engraver of the <br/>
haiku poem, "Yoshitame".  Does anyone know who this person was or <br/>
what school he engraved for?<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone have information on this tsuba?<br/>
<br/>
Here is the link:<br/>

Yoshitame looks like a correct reading, but sosho always leaves me wondering if there aren't other kanji that could be "abbreviated" in the same way.  On the left side of the seppa dai there are faint kaisho style mei that might read Myochin.  If that's what it is I suppose that it could be the plate maker.  <br/>
<br/>
There is a Yoshitame listed in Wakayama and Haynes.  It's Haynes #H12160.  Personal name Seiunsha [&#38738;&#38642;&#33294;], worked in Kanazawa in Kaga, ca. 1800, "made tsuba."<br/>
<br/>
No mention of Myochin, but of course there were Myochin people making iron plate tsuba in Kaga at that time.<br/>
