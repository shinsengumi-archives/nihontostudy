someone properly trained in that art, and with the proper supplies. <br/>
Attempting to do it yourself will ruin the sword and any value it may <br/>
have. Without looking at the sword, or at least a few good pictures <br/>
of it, no one can tell you what it is (Japanese or otherwise), nor <br/>
how old. With pictures some might venture a guess, but for a real <br/>
opinion you'll need to take it to someone who knows nihonto so they <br/>
can examine it.<br/>
