<div id="ygrps-yiv-186852451">Hello:<br/>
 <br/>
Ok....I got the thing polished and mounted...now that it is "all together"  <br/>
it doesn't look all THAT curved.  Nagasa is 27 1/4" the sori is just a  <br/>
smidge under 1 1/2" Tsuka length is 11 1/4"  OAL:  39 1/8"..  Shinogi-Zukuri, <br/>
no Hi...Which is unusual for me cause I think they make he blade  look <br/>
"finished"<br/>
 <br/>
The hamon I was going for was  Notare but I botched it...more like  Gunome <br/>
now i got it showing..sigh...Hey if it was easy everybody would be doing  it <br/>
right??<br/>
 <br/>
Mounted in a lion motif with black samegawa under some of that very so hard <br/>
 to find black and gold chevron weave silk ito...Tsuka is curved to match <br/>
the  blade sori as best as I could...<br/>
 <br/>
So..is this something that could of been made some place, some time or did  <br/>
I totally screw the pooch?? Now I got to figure out how to do the siya...I <br/>
am  thinking black same and the rest in gold leaf under black cracked  <br/>
lacquer....<br/>
 <br/>
So let me know..hope the pic goes through<br/>
