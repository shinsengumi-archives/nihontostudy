<h3>Displaying swords</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1433073730">Dear fellow nihontophiles,<br/>
<br/>
I am thinking about redecorating my apartment somewhat and found myself wandering how best to display multible swords? <br/>
<br/>
What do others do? Put a couple out on display ( loose or in a large glass display cabinet?) and keep the rest in the vault? <br/>
<br/>
Do you display the papers with the sword? <br/>
<br/>
Are there others who display lots of swords and tsuba? How do people do this? I don't like the idea of a sword rack on the wall where people can just take the swords off. I am thinking more along the lines of a display behind glass or perspex.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps other members could post pictures of how they have their swords display? Alternatively email them to me at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:matthewhoyle@...">matthewhoyle@...</a> <br/>
<br/>
Regards, Matthew<br/>
