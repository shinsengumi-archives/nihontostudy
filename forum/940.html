I think that the mundane explanation of the use of the kogai is probably the correct one.  The shaft/point is for arranging hair and the hook at the other end (mimikaki) is for cleaning ears.  The same sort of implement exists for women, but often made out of tortoise shell or other materials.  I happened to see an extensive display of them at the Tokyo National Museum a couple of years ago.  You can still buy bags of little wooden mimikaki in Japan -- kind of like Q-tips, but hard and pointy.<br/>
<br/>
The umabari or bashin was apparently used for acupuncture and perhaps minor surgery on horses.  I was skeptical of the acupuncture idea, but apparently it was done.  Tom Helm had more information on this the last time the topic came up here, so it'd be worth checking the list archives to dig it up.<br/>
<br/>
I've heard several alternative stories on the use of the kogai, but none of them were entirely convincing.  If anyone has good sources, evidence or arguments supporting other versions I'd like to hear it.  Multiple uses are possible.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1649746667">Thanks for the direction to previous postings here; they helped <br/>
alot.  seems to be a lot of mystery around these little tools.  What <br/>
swords had which tool more commonly, when did they first appear, and <br/>
of course for some, what were they really used for.<br/>
<br/>
i now have several avenues of research to persue.<br/>
<br/>
Man, i am really starting to love this hobby!!  Every answer leasds <br/>
to 10 questions ... and the stuff (the real stuff) is super beautiful.<br/>
<br/>
will share any new research.<br/>

I think it's a wee bit too big for acupunture.<br/>
OTOH, the novice acupunturist would not miss any  " energy points " <br/>
with a big needle like that...........<br/>
