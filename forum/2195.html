DON"T MESS WITH THE RUST INSIDE THE SUKASHI CUTOUTS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
Now that I've said that...<br/>
<br/>
I've seen all sorts of tsuba abuse ("brown" wax, various attempts at <br/>
repatination, people who have<br/>
decided they can do a better job of patination than the original maker <br/>
and strip top quality<br/>
pieces down and start over, people who just wax them with some magic <br/>
compound, oil them, etc.,.) - don't do it -<br/>
basically, Jinsoo is absolutely correct - if the surface patina is good, <br/>
just store 'em somewhere where they<br/>
won't get condensed on and rub them periodically with your hands/a soft <br/>
cloth.  If its got problems, see below...<br/>
<br/>
the deadly enemy of iron tsuba is red rust - if your piece has this on <br/>
it, its a problem.  somehow you have to<br/>
get this off - some people use horn, but I've found that ivory seems to <br/>
be really good for use to scrape this off<br/>
while not harming the the brown rust (I think Jim Gilbert has an <br/>
excellent article on this in a couple of<br/>
places on line...).  - often you have to work at it quite a bit - I <br/>
sometimes alternate scraping sessions with<br/>
washing the piece in warm water with a mild soap and a soft <br/>
toothbrush...  And again, you only want to<br/>
do this ONLY on the outside surfaces of the tsuba, not down in the sukashi.<br/>
<br/>
After you've done that, the revealed old rust regions are often pretty <br/>
gnarly, or if the piece is just plain "rough",<br/>
you can "pocket polish" the piece - just carry it around<br/>
in your pocket for a few weeks (NOT where you carry your keys/change) - <br/>
this gives the piece a nice rubbed look that<br/>
is hard to get by just marathon rubbing sessions with a cloth...<br/>
<br/>
When you're buying tsuba, always be on the lookout for pieces that have <br/>
been "primped" like this - you'll see<br/>
people that hide a multitude of sins with various waxes, oils, PAINT (I <br/>
got a couple like this - the guy color<br/>
matched the patina and jammed the tsuba (!!) - looked real darned good, <br/>
too - I was quite happy until I tried to clean<br/>
up a rough spot I thought was oil, used some enamel thinner, and - <br/>
surprise!...), etc.,.  I'd like to think they<br/>
just wanted the pieces to look better/didn't know any better and really <br/>
weren't thinking fraudulent thoughts, but....<br/>
<br/>
Good Luck,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1793338714">Hi Richard,<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for your excellent words of wisdom.  I think the <br/>
message I'm getting is:  just leave well enough alone!  So I <br/>
believe I will...  :o).  <br/>
One thing, though:  for rookies like me, how would you suggest <br/>
being able to spot the oiled, waxed, or (gulp) painted tsuba that <br/>
may deceive me?  I certainly hear what you're saying, and want <br/>
to heed your words.  But how, exactly, can I know it when I see it?  <br/>
I don't believe any of the pieces I've acquired thus far have been <br/>
tampered with this way, but I guess I can't really be sure (I have <br/>
not attempted any soap and water cleaning of them.  They <br/>
appear in great condition to my untrained eye, and so I haven't <br/>
felt any need to clean...).  Most of my pieces have Hozon papers: <br/>
would this be any indication at all that the tsuba in question are <br/>
more likely to be "deception-free"?  Or is that entirely irrelevant?  <br/>
Sorry for all the bothersome questions, but I really am eager to <br/>
become informed!  Many thanks, Richard, for your time and <br/>
attention...<br/>

<h3>Re: tsuba, waxing, etc...</h3>
by <i>frkirk</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-241713916">Hi Steven and All<br/>
I am fairly new to the group but throught I would throw my 2 cents <br/>
in.<br/>
On the latter part of your question- if a tsuba has Hozon (or other <br/>
respected) papers I woud leave it be- even be cautious about how <br/>
much you "pocket polish" it.  I have also heard tell of great tsubas <br/>
that were made too glossy my over zealous cloth rubbers.  As you <br/>
say, leave well enough alone and err on the side of caution.<br/>
If the tsuba is un-certified and you are unsure as to the <br/>
authenticity of its patina, I beleive that dunking it in boiling <br/>
water cannot harm it and may remove grime and wax at least.  Please <br/>
use only plain water for this and make sure the piece is dry ASAP <br/>
once it is removed.  What you may get from this process will be a <br/>
UGLY lookin tsuba since any false patina will be stripped and red <br/>
rust, pits, etc will be exposed.  While you might be saying to <br/>
yourself, "It looked better before" you now can start from ground <br/>
zero and nurse it back to health.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps<br/>
Kirk<br/>

<br/>
well, there are ways to restore tsuba.  Cary and most other dealers <br/>
have their restoration people .  So restoration is NOT a cardinal <br/>
sin , that is, assuming you know what you are doing. <br/>
If you really want to try your hands on restoration, buy some po-edo <br/>
( an e-bay seller well known for selling  cheapo )tsuba, they are <br/>
cheap and they lack " artistic merits ".  <br/>
<br/>
By the way, I don't think there's any school in training tsuba <br/>
restorers.  If they charge you a fee.....they are professional. If <br/>
you do it yourself, it's amateur.   Hahhahaaaaa, flame on, I am ready <br/>

First of all, even papered pieces may have stuff that might need to be <br/>
taken care of on<br/>
them (red rust, etc.), and I'd guess even some of these end up getting <br/>
"primped"<br/>
by later owners.  Sorry - Papers are a good start, but...<br/>
<br/>
I had alluded to Jim's article about tsuba care - he recommends boiling <br/>
water, which works<br/>
pretty well.<br/>
<br/>
On paint, I should have been more clear (that's what I get for typing <br/>
late at night) - often older<br/>
tsubas were lacquered - remmnants of old paint on a tsuba should be <br/>
handled with the greatest<br/>
care/respect (on really old tsuba you'll see the paint form this <br/>
funky/cool amalgum with the surface<br/>
patina) - you have to proceed carefully (or just leave well enough <br/>
alone) when you have old<br/>
paint like that - I had a tosho once I nicknamed "rusty crusty" because <br/>
there was a fairly thick<br/>
uncared for patina on it - BUT there was also a fair amount of what <br/>
appeared to be original<br/>
lacquer, so I left it well enough alone - while the tsuba would probably <br/>
have looked a whole<br/>
lot better/sold for more if I had just attacked it a little with the <br/>
ivory/rubbing, it didn't seem<br/>
right since it would have nuked the lacquer as well...  The real answer <br/>
is experience...  You need<br/>
to go and look at and study (and take good pictures of if you're <br/>
motivated) a bunch of good tsuba...<br/>
<br/>
On "primped" tsuba, an amazing number of tsuba in the US appear to have <br/>
gotten the "treatment" -<br/>
I've pretty much stopped buying pieces from people in the US who I don't <br/>
know because of this -<br/>
I've been burned enough so I can usually recognize its been jacked with, <br/>
but I get tired of sending<br/>
pieces back - but you'll even get stuff from Japan occasionally that has <br/>
been "helped"...  (comments<br/>
about how many people don't seem to understand white balance on digital <br/>
cameras deleted).<br/>

-What he said.-<br/>
(I concur).<br/>
<br/>
Read Gilbert article (on his website) on cleaning<br/>
tsuba. If/when you first try to clean a tsuba, go<br/>
slow. I overdid one of my first ones a bit, and have<br/>
spent 2 years promoting healthy repatination & the<br/>
occassional rub. On a good dense Tosho tsuba, this is<br/>
an agonizingly slow process. Many people don't have<br/>
the patience.<br/>
   When doing the horn/ivory cleaning, but to practice<br/>
with a $50 tsuba off ebay that has just a little rust.<br/>
It will get you accustomed to the feel of doint the<br/>
work.<br/>

Just nodding my head in agreement at this point.<br/>
Warning that many initially tsuba look ugly as heck<br/>
after boiling.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-603763311">Hi Kirk,<br/>
<br/>
Yes, it does help. Thanks.  All this information you and the others <br/>
are providing is very useful.  As it happens, none of the tsuba I <br/>
have is in "dirty" condition, so there is really nothing to tempt me <br/>
to try cleaning in any form, except, perhaps, the occasional light <br/>
rubbing with the soft cloth.  I hear what you're saying even here, <br/>
however, so I will err on the side of caution, as you say.  Thanks, <br/>
too, for your insight re: the Hozon papers question.  I appreciate <br/>
it!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1527720479">Thanks, Curran.  It is really helping to get all this feedback.  I'm <br/>
hoping that a clear general recommended approach will <br/>
emerge, and that I can take some confidence from this.  Your <br/>
suggestion about finding a $50 tsuba to work on is good.  <br/>
Incidentally, where does one find the  substances (ivory, bone, <br/>
etc...) mentioned?  Thanks again.<br/>

<br/>
Great information.  Thanks so much for your time and trouble.  I <br/>
would be (even more) indebted to you if you might be able to <br/>
direct me to a site/webpage/publication/collection of photos  <br/>
which might actually illustrated such primped or doctored tsuba.  <br/>
I hear all that you're saying, but it would help so much to be able <br/>
to actually see pieces which you and others would have such <br/>
suspicions about...  I really appreciate your help.<br/>

What you're seeing inside the nakago ana appears to be the result of the hammering to change the size of the nakago ana.  That's fairly common.  Always try to confirm any "layering" in the other sukashi openings and rim.  This iron looks quite homogeneous in the other openings in the photos.  <br/>
<br/>
Shodai Nishigaki Kanshiro can indeed show some loose laminations in his plate that can be visible in the sukashi or even as delaminations on the surface.  I can't think of any other Higo makers that have that.  Your guard is in Nishigaki style, but is pretty late.  "Kodai Higo." <br/>

at the rest of the guard. Being at the office, how long did the <br/>
