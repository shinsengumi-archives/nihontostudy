<div id="ygrps-yiv-1451790143">Posted on that other list by,<br/>
  someone who has had some bad dealings with Hoshino in SF and who is <br/>
taking various legal actions to recover his money.  Whilst it may not <br/>
be appropriate to post his exact email to this list, he is filing a <br/>
complaint (amongst other things) with the District Attorney in San <br/>
Mateo County - Consumer Fraud office Tel (650) 363-4651. <br/>
<br/>
He is asking if anyone who has had similar bad dealings of any kind, to <br/>
contact him or call the Consumer Fraud Office.<br/>
  If anyone on this list wishes me to pass on his email to you directly, <br/>
please email me PRIVATELY.<br/>
