<h3>NTHK 1979 report</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-758961131">Hi all - <br/>
<br/>
Thought I'd direct this out to everybody in hopes of finding somebody who has NTHK Journals from 1979 through 1980 years. (Mine begin with 1984, wouldn't you know.)<br/>
<br/>
Mr. Yoshikawa held an NTHK shinsa in Chicago as part of the Token Study Group/JSSUS joint-effort, Token Kai 1979. Often, the NTHK would publish a report on their U.S.A. shinsa and feature a few interesting items for publication. I am interested in finding out if in ther report on this 1979 shinsa, if by chance they published oshigata of any Yokoyama Bizen Sukenaga swords. <br/>
<br/>
In the Chicago Token Study Group report (listing of results) that was distrubuted in 1981, three shinshin-to Yokoyama Bizen Sukenaga went through shinsa. One, a katana with kiku mon, reached 78 points and the other two, a katana and wakizashi, reached 75 points. I'm interested to see oshigata of the two 75 point swords although if any were illustrated, it would likely be the 78 pointer. <br/>
<br/>
Probably a hopeless quest for information but...   Contact me privately if you wish: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:swords@...">swords@...</a>      Thanks!<br/>
