<div id="ygrps-yiv-177963868">Hi All,<br/>
   If some of the comments made could be fused and edited the <br/>
tekkotsu in tsuba may be explained as to why they appear or not.<br/>
   When tsuba were in their infancy on the new curved single edged <br/>
sword they were made by the smiths who made the swords. It makes no <br/>
sense that separate steels would be used, so the tamahagane and old <br/>
steels being reused were the base metals used in the tsuba <br/>
manufacture. this would cause the same characteristics found in the <br/>
blades to appear in the tsuba. Inclusions, layers, and <br/>
nonhomogeneity in the steel itself. In the art sense this would be <br/>
the primitivist stage where form came before function. The times <br/>
were constant warfare and all parts must be robust.<br/>
   Now come the times of peace and for the most part form supplants <br/>
function. Soft iron is a good plate for carving and inlay and soft <br/>
metals become more and more common. No more tekkotsu for the most <br/>
part except for the few schools that continue the tradition of <br/>
worked steel.<br/>
    Shinshinto times bring the revival of the old ways. What <br/>
appeared on old tsuba was now a favourable thing to copy including <br/>
using steel again and emphasising attributes such as tekkotsu. <br/>
Appreciation of functional aspects were now artistically <br/>
appreciated. What was functional had now become raised to the <br/>
highest form. This happened in the Chanoyu, Kodo and was almost <br/>
decadent. I'll leave that argument for another day. John</div>
