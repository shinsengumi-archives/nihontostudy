<div id="ygrps-yiv-890983434">I would think it more likely that the habaki is an expression of the owner/user's political allegiance, rather than indicating a "solid" Tokugawa connection.  Of course, by this time I imagine the aoi mon was being used as a "decorator" item by all and sundry with no fear of losing one's head!!  As Peter observed, if the habaki is a high quality item it points more to my first suggestion and if poorer quality then to the second.  Here in Australia there is a Koto wakizashi by (I think) IESUKE (nijimei) that has a solid gold niju habaki with a sukashi Oda mon.  The quality is just excellent, but is it a "connection/allegiance" piece or a "decorator"??  Without a large number of documented similar pieces we will never know.<br/>

  Subject: [nihonto] Yamon Naokatsu<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  Hi all - <br/>
<br/>
  Does anyone know of any connection that Yamon Naokatsu (2nd generation) had with the Tokugawa? Reason I ask, I have a short katana by Shoji Yamon Naokatsu (dated Meiji 4 - 1871) which has a silver habaki with the Tokugawa aoi crest on it in sukashi (pierced). I believe this habaki was original to the sword (not a collector's replacement) but so far I've yet to find some connection between the smith and the Tokugawa. <br/>
<br/>
  Thanks,<br/>
<br/>
