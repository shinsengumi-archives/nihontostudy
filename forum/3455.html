<div id="ygrps-yiv-1692241985">Dear all-<br/>
apologies for cross posting,<br/>
<br/>
I have learned that Sasama Yoshihiko Sensei of the Nihon Katchu Bugu<br/>
Rekishi Kenkyu-kai has passed away. I am sorry I cannot report the details<br/>
of his passing but know that his funeral was held on the 7th of November in<br/>
Japan.<br/>
<br/>
He was truly a gentlemen and truly of the old school. A tireless<br/>
researcher, talented artist, prolific writer and a teacher of inexhaustible<br/>
knowledge, patience and generosity. Thanks to him the very world we love to<br/>
inhabit, the true world of the samurai warrior, his swords and armour have<br/>
been kept alive for us and generations to come. He is gone and he will be<br/>
missed, but his writings remain as testament to the great, grand and good<br/>
man that he was.<br/>
<br/>
I shall post more, should I get the details, anyone wishing to send<br/>
condolence (via snail mail) feel free to contact me OFF LIST.<br/>
