<h3>unscientific kawa tsuba experiment</h3>
by <i>yamaimojg</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1552153941">After we were talking about nerikawa vs. iron tsuba the other day, I decided to try my hand at the leather tsuba craft.  I took 3 pieces of 1-2 mm thick "dog grade" pre-chewed rawhide and soaked them in water for several hours until they were completely soft and pliable.  I pressed the three layers tightly together between two boards in a bench vise and left them over night.  I then glued the three still moist pieces together with an aliphatic wood glue.  I suspect that a hide or hoof glue would be closer to what was originally used, but I didn't have any handy.  Then it went back into the vise press over night. <br/>
<br/>
The stack came out well-adhered, but still flexible.  It was fairly easy to cut through with multiple passes of a sharp knife.  After a day of drying in the sun, the laminated piece was much more rigid and didn't warp.   Rainy weather called for subsequent drying in the house.  After a couple of days the 3 layer laminate can still be flexed a few mm by hand.  At this point the laminate is quite hard to cut, but easy to saw or shape with a rasp.  The layers stay well adhered during these operations.<br/>
<br/>
I am not trained as a swordsman and I have no swords handy, so I resorted to a ca. WWII vintage Gurkha Kukri for test cutting.  The cross section is on the thick side for a knife, but "sharper" than the typical nihonto.  I clamped one end of my "tsuba" to a bench, leaving about 4.5 cm of unsupported material sticking out into space.  I had no success in repeated tries at cutting the face of the tsuba.  There is enough flex in the laminated leather to send the blade skidding off from the face of the guard, just occasionally taking a sliver of material from the edge.  I suppose that a perfect slicing cut with a sword would do more damage, but then again in use you weren't likely to fight against an opponent with his sword hand clamped down to a bench.  <br/>
<br/>
Turning the "tsuba" edge up to test cutting straight into the mimi was an entirely different story.  A light chop was enough to cut over 1 cm into the edge.  No doubt there were ways to make a tougher guard than I did, however I have to believe that these would not be sufficient to stop a strong sword cut to the edge from cutting entirely through the guard, including any yamagane fukurin or o-seppa.<br/>
<br/>
So, long story, but what I found is that as long as someone else cures the hide it's quite easy to make a functional kawa tsuba.  Lacquer and a fukurin would dress the guard up and help protect it from moisture, but I don't think would change the basic properties of the tsuba.  It is tough and light weight, would certainly keep one's hand from sliding up on the blade and it would seem to be effective at stopping a opponent's cut that came sliding down the blade.  However, it would be next to useless at stopping a cut to the edge.<br/>
<br/>
Speculation -- was there something about the way that a tachi was used that would make a cut to the edge of the guard relatively unlikely when compared to wielding a katana?  It might help explain why nerikawa tsuba were the guard of choice for fighting tachi, but were replaced by iron for katana.<br/>

Pretty cool stuff. If you think about it, it should be rather difficult to<br/>
hit the rim of a tsuba, and I am sure most swordsmen would not want to<br/>
anyway. Common knowledge says that the tsuba was not a "guard," but<br/>
something to prevent the hand from slipping onto the blade. Due to the<br/>
curvature, I also think that the cutting edge would not hit the edge of the<br/>
tsuba straight on anyway. Just some food for thought.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-357114414">I think Tom has a good point. The early warrior chronicles would support<br/>
this notion of one on one combat. The sohei (warrior monks) with their long<br/>
naginata and nagamaki might have hit a tsuba, but as these warriors were<br/>
essentially unmounted, I think they did not typically engage with mounted<br/>
warriors. I know that a naginata is good for taking down a horse, but you<br/>
have to stand out in the open with a guy who is also armed with a bow to do<br/>
that, I would think. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1836506371">From late Heian, actually.  The examples I've seen in the outside of Japan have all been Edo period, and most if not all from the late Edo period.  They're quite new and shiny looking.  They often have some sort of decoration to the lacquer.  The fukurin (rim cover) are new and crisp looking.  The guards tend to be on the small side, but thicker than a similarly sized metal guard from the same period.<br/>
<br/>
Most of the Heian and Kamakura period examples at Oyamazumi are delaminated.  If they hadn't been left untouched "strung" on the nakago of the swords they're mounted on they would likely have been discarded long ago.  Probably one reason why there are so few old examples around.  Mokko shape seems to predominate.  These tend to be larger diameter with moderate thickness.  The ones that are still intact just look very old in comparison to the Edo period examples.  Hard to be more quantitative about that.  I can't remember seeing a decorated example from the early period.<br/>
<br/>
I don't have a big enough sample to work from to be too confident, but the nerikawa guards from late Kamakura, Nanbokucho and early Muromachi tend to look disproportionately thick compared to the earlier ones.  The Nanbokucho and Muromachi ones are more often round or oval shaped rather than mokko.  Some mokko examples from that time have unusually small "lobes."  <br/>
<br/>
That's all I can think of for now.<br/>
