<h3>tobiyaki</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1133317846">Benjamin Smith Lyman, writing in 1892, says:<br/>
<br/>
"If the loam covering while moving the blade back and forth during the<br/>
heating, becomes thinner in some spots or loose, so that the heat of the<br/>
fire, and subsequently the chilling of the bath work more strongly, there<br/>
arise in the surface of the blade isolated cloudy spots called tobi-yaki or<br/>
yu-hashiri (sic). They cannot be produced on purpose, are rare, and are seen<br/>
with satisfaction."<br/>
<br/>
My impression is that Lyman is mistaken, and that this feature can be<br/>
produced deliberately.  Is that correct?<br/>
<br/>
And are tobiyaki really regarded as especially rare and an unusual sign of<br/>
quality?</div>
