<h3>fuji, mon and tsuba</h3>
by <i>yamaimojg</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1056144535">Hi all,<br/>
I'm looking for thoughts on the reading of the sukashi design on a Ko-Tosho tsuba with a wisteria motif.  Please take a look at the photos on the group site at:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://tinyurl.com/cfw7">http://tinyurl.com/cfw7</a><br/>
<br/>
Real Japanese wisteria grow with the flower clusters hanging downward... see photo of an actual wisteria currently blooming in my yard.  Some fittings depict this plant in a naturalistic way as in the example of the Momoyama period Ko-Kinko o-kozuka.  This motif has also been stylized in mon with double strands of flowers either hanging down or pointing upward (which as far as I know they don't do in nature).  I have only run across single strand fuji mon with the flowers "hanging" up as illustrated in the mon photo.<br/>
<br/>
Questions:<br/>
Does anyone have an example of a single strand wisteria mon with the flower cluster hanging down in the naturalistic way?<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone know if there is some particular significance to the "upside down" versions of the mon?<br/>
<br/>
Which orientation of the tsuba makes sense to you?  Is it depicting the actual plant (katana orientation) or the single strand mon (which would require a tachi orientation)?<br/>
<br/>
Any ideas appreciated,<br/>

I have an Edo period tachi koshirae with the Fuji mon ( lower right ),the <br/>
mons and the menuki are all pointing " upward ".<br/>
I will check on big mon book and see if I can figure it out.<br/>

I used to have a beat up wak with Sendai iron f/k, with matching <br/>
fitting on the saya.<br/>
The tsuba that came with it has the wisteria motif with the leaves on <br/>
top( when mounted  properly ) inlaid with " gold foil ".<br/>
I am not sure, but I think Arnold bought the tsuba.<br/>
I still have the menuki which is a pheasants in a pot ( style of Goto <br/>
school )<br/>

	It is a tachi tsuba! From your mon page you can see there are <br/>
left (turned, curled) and right (turned,curled) fuji. Remembering <br/>
this is stylized, you need not confine you point of view to "up and <br/>
down". Imagine that you are looking not from the side (up down <br/>
orientation) but from above. You can see the green leaves and the <br/>
flowers blown left or right by the wind. Or the same POV but your cut <br/>
flowers are now floating in a circular bowl...<br/>
	To my eye the tachi orientation looks correct. Imagine this <br/>
on a sword, and how the human eye would "read" the design. The katana <br/>
orientation looks awkward and I think doesn't read right. I think it <br/>
more likely the greater portion of this design being on the ura side <br/>
of the tsuba is more natural. In the katana orientation the greater <br/>
portion of of the design is "outside" and under the sword, not an <br/>
especially auspicious arrangement. It is only my humble opinion but I <br/>
feel it is a tachi tsuba.<br/>

Interesting question.<br/>
<br/>
I looked at the pictures for a long while, and tried to imagine the tsuba being mounted and in an oncoming position as if it was mounted and worn.<br/>
<br/>
To my eye it looks more natural if mounted on a tachi with the ha pointing down.<br/>
<br/>
If mounted on a katana the sukashi is hidden against the clothing and body and just does not seem right.<br/>
<br/>
I think it would work either way however, just looks better mounted as a tachi.<br/>

May be your perception is prejudiced by the 4 mon Jim posted.<br/>
If in deed the wisteria motif represent a mon on that tsuba, there <br/>
are many mon with the wisteria hanging down the natural way.<br/>
From the big mon book Tom bought for me while he's in Japan, I <br/>
counted over 20 mon with wisteria hanging down.<br/>
I sent the illustrations to Jim, may be Jim can post some of those <br/>
onto the list album ( the scans I sent are not of the higest <br/>
quality )?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-132776603">Thanks for everyone's comments... I added two new mon scans from Milt's book to the jim/wisteria photo album:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://tinyurl.com/cfw7">http://tinyurl.com/cfw7</a>  (thanks Milt)<br/>
<br/>
I found only one single strand fuji mon with the leaves at the top, although as Milt mentioned there are a lot of double strand ones with that orientation.  I noticed that all but one mon, regardless of flowers going up or down, have the three leaf cluster pointing "up."  I added a scan of that one, too.  <br/>
<br/>
So with all of these mon, none are an exact match to the guard in katana orientation, although there are these two mon that are close.  There is a very good match already posted in tachi orientation.<br/>
<br/>
I'll write some more later,<br/>

I agree with what you're saying, but remember that if the tsuba is flipped front-back, then the sukashi is hidden when worn as a tachi and revealed when worn as a katana.  I only have a photo of the tsuba, so I flipped it in Photoshop and added it to the album.  Does looking at the other side change the leaning of your reading?<br/>
<br/>
The kozuka I posted is mine and when I hand it to people they invariably orient it with the leaves at the bottom and the flower growing up.  Apparently that looks natural to most people, including me until I realized that it was a wisteria (and that the opening for the blade is on the normal end when the flower is positioned hanging down).  <br/>
<br/>
BTW, the piece is 83.4 mm diameter, 3.3 mm thick at the seppa dai, 2.2  mm thick at the mimi.<br/>

The only thing remaining then is what is front and back.<br/>

The hammer marks are normally on the front but that does not mean much in this case I do not think, as its an older piece and they would use either side to tighten it to a nakago depending on how much metal is left where.<br/>

I guess we may never know.  Nice tsuba.<br/>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2109894429">Hi John,<br/>
Agreed on the hammer marks, etc.  The owner originally saw this as a katana tsuba, based on a naturalistic reading of the wisteria.  Bob Haynes convinced him that it was a tachi tsuba based on its similarity to the published single strand mon.  I was initially convinced that it was a katana tsuba, also based on a naturalistic reading and my bias from my experience with that fuji kozuka.  I thought that finding a matching mon would be easy given that there seems to be every variation of mon under the sun, but so far we haven't turned up an exact match.  Although that it does or does not match a published mon doesn't prove the intention of the maker or wearer.  Could it be a tachi guard... I think yes.  Is it probably a tachi guard... maybe.<br/>
<br/>
Tom's idea of the "inverted" motif being viewed from above or below rather than up or down is very interesting.  The idea that a design being "under the sword" is inauspicious is something I hadn't encountered before.  That would still be true for katana orientation even with a front-back flip.  Maybe Tom can say some more about that. <br/>
<br/>
Some other thoughts... it doesn't look like it could have been mounted with o-seppa.  Of course without having a surviving tachi koshirae mounted with a Ko-Tosho tsuba, we don't know if they were mounted with o-seppa or not.  It has no hitsuana, but there are intact period katana koshirae with no kozuka or kogai.  The owner thinks that the date is mid Muromachi, which is possible given the diameter, thickness and appearance of the plate.  The design strikes me as very Momoyama, although it's possible that someone important enough to be wearing a tachi might have ordered this kind of elaborate guard much earlier.<br/>
<br/>
I've been looking at the dang thing so long I'm not sure which orientation looks better... I'm currently leaning toward tachi, but "flipped" katana is tough to rule out.  <br/>
<br/>
Spreading the confusion...<br/>
