<h3>20% Off - Eight Day Anniversary Sale on all books at Bridge of Dreams</h3>
by <i>musashibobenkei</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1599201042">In recognition of my fourth year in business full time selling books, and in<br/>
gratitude to the support that all of my friends in the collecting<br/>
communities have given, I am announcing an 20% off sale through midnight<br/>
7/7/07 - eight full days. (It's just past midnight on the East coast, but of<br/>
course it's already Friday afternoon in Australia and Japan, Friday morning<br/>
in Europe, so to keep it fair let's say the sale ends midnight 7/7/07<br/>
wherever you are.) Please do feel free to pass this message on to interested<br/>
collectors who may not be on the several email lists (and excuse the<br/>
cross-posting.)<br/>
<br/>
No minimum purchase - or maximum. This is your chance to get a great deal on<br/>
Soshu Den Meisaku Shu, Tanobe's Meihin Katanaezu Shusei, the complete 6<br/>
volume Kanzan Token Koza, complete 10 volume Haynes Auction Catalogs,<br/>
Fukushi's Goto and Machibori books, or the Kokuh么 T么ken Zufu.<br/>
<br/>
All shipping will be done at cost as I always have. Postage rates,<br/>
especially for overseas shipments have changed drastically since May 14th,<br/>
but I will work with you to get your order to you safely and quickly with<br/>
the least expense possible.<br/>
<br/>
Regrettably, if you live in Illinois, I have to charge 8.75% sales tax.<br/>
<br/>
As always, what is listed on my website is not all of what I have on hand,<br/>
though I will make every effort to keep updating. If there's something<br/>
you've been looking for, please do ask as I very likely may have it.<br/>
<br/>
Payment by PayPal, or direct credit card charge to your Visa, MasterCard,<br/>
American Express, or Discover Card, and I will accept wire transfers to<br/>
accommodate overseas customers.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, I am aware that the hosting service I use has an expired security<br/>
certificate, so if you want to use a credit card you can call me, fax me, or<br/>
split the information into two or more email messages. Also, there's a bug<br/>
in the PayPal ordering button - yes, I'm moving to a new hosting service and<br/>
working with a new web person to fix these things. It's probably best to<br/>
email me directly in any case as the shipping for each order will be<br/>
different.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance for your continued support!<br/>
<br/>
Craig<br/>
