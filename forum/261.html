<h3>Japanese Tamahagane Links</h3>

On a knifemaking site, I came across the following post, likely by a <br/>
Japanese national, re current sources for tamahagane.  <br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.dfoggknives.com/discus/messages/7/453.html?1052233766">http://www.dfoggknives.com/discus/messages/7/453.html?1052233766</a><br/>
<br/>
Note the links at the bottom of the post.  Okay, the Princess Monouke <br/>
link is a loser, but the others are better.  I particularly enjoyed <br/>
the sushi link, where the chef discusses the types and the lineage of <br/>
the sushi knife, relating it to nihonto.  Enjoy!<br/>

<br/>
"Yasugi works had developed same directly deoxidation method as tatara without using charcoal made from woods."<br/>

I know nothing beyond what is contained in the post.  My guess is <br/>
that the author is referring to more modern, industrial methods that <br/>
approximate the tartara but produce tamahagane or a reasonable <br/>
facsimile without utilizing expensive charcoal and which methods lend <br/>
themselves to faster, higher volume, less man-hour intensive <br/>
production.  I think you should go into the listed Japanese sites and <br/>
translate for us!  ;o)<br/>

It'd be interesting if there is such a thing.<br/>
<br/>
I think we'd need a faster, higher volume, less man-hour intensive translator than me to find out, though.<br/>
