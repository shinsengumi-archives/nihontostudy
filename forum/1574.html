<h3>Sword?</h3>
by <i>fishingfishtrout2000</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1904831688">Thanks for all the help. I will post pics as soon as possible.  I <br/>
live on the east coast of North Carolina (Cape Lookout, Cape <br/>
Hatteras). Would anyone happen to know a reliable source nearby who <br/>
could look at it in hand.<br/>
  Some one asked me if I could take the handle off.  I have and there <br/>
are no markings anywhere that "I" can see.  I haven't cleaned the <br/>
tang so there may be something  I'm not seeing.  Only light file <br/>
marks that have faded quite considerably if not gone altogether.  <br/>
Thanks again for the help.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1864545169">Absolutely do not "clean the tang"!  The nakago doesn't have to be <br/>
signed to give you information, but it does have to be "as found."<br/>

<h3>Sword?</h3>
by <i>fishingfishtrout2000</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1786604923">I posted a message about a sword I've had for years a few weeks <br/>
ago.  I have finally taken some pictures.  They are in the photo <br/>
gallery of this group under "Closet Find".  I would appreciate any <br/>
information.  And thanks again for your help.</div>
