I appreciate the warning, and hope that you ultimately receive your funds back. Or better yet, the Kiyosada.<br/>
Good luck friend,<br/>

  At present you can find a Kiyosada japanese Sword with NBTHK papers <br/>
  for sale on ebay. I bought this sword the 21th. of february 2004, <br/>
  payed it but never received it. By request I received several other <br/>
  photos of the sword and the NBTHK papers as well as copies from his <br/>
  passport and driverslicense. This information is avaible for the <br/>
  list if you don´t find it inconvenient. Look well at this sword on <br/>
  ebay and take care of wolflady 137 and jnetweb as well as John <br/>
  Pivec, Minneapolis, USA. This sword will without any doubt be put <br/>
  for sale again. If anyone has this sword in their possession, please <br/>
  let me know. I will award informations which will place the sword at <br/>
  my house with 1000 U.S.dollars. If the Nihonto study group find it <br/>
  appropiate I will put photos of the sword as well as John Pivecs <br/>
  passport and driverslicense, on the list. <br/>
  The Danish Criminal Police, The Danish Foreign Ministry and the USA <br/>
  Police are involved in the investigation and I have asked ebay to <br/>
  help with information as well.<br/>
  Thankyou for your help in advance<br/>
  All the best<br/>

<br/>
Sorry to hear about your problems.  This sort of fraud causes every collector nightmares.<br/>
<br/>
Do you own this sword or did you buy it and not have it shipped?<br/>
<br/>
