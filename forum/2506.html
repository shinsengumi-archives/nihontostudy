<div id="ygrps-yiv-1292835587">Hi to all.  I would like to announce a new Japanese sword show that is going <br/>
to be held in May in Chicago this year.  It is going to be called the Midwest <br/>
Token Kai and will be hosted by Marc Porpora.  This show will replace the old <br/>
Chicago show that was held in the fall.  I am attaching a flier so please read <br/>
the specifics from that. <br/>
The show dates are May 20.21, &22.  There will be a lecture and display by <br/>
Bob Benson of<br/>
Important Juyo, along with other activities. So please plan to attend. <br/>
Thanks, George<br/>

No need to send it. Jim G. sent me the info. It's<br/>
already posted :-) Thanks anyway.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
BTW, does anyone know if there is a San Antonio show<br/>
this year? It is also usually held in May.<br/>
