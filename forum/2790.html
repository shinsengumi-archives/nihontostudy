<div id="ygrps-yiv-227258822">Hello Rafael - <br/>
<br/>
There were a couple comments made about Murata-to in past issues of the JSS/US Newsletter -- issues: Vol. 21, No. 1, p.19 and Vol. 26, No.2, p.7 -- both of which refer back to what Inami Hakusui wrote in 1948 in his book, "Nippon-to; The Japanese Sword. "Military Swords of Japan" (Fuller and Gregory) calls these swords "Mura-to" and which Arn Slettebak disagrees with, where it is written about the lack of nioi/nie. <br/>
<br/>
Briefly, the late Harry Mack wrote in Volume 26 that Murata-to were made by a process invented by Murata Tsuneyoshi around the turn of the 20th century. The blade was basically a one-piece machine-made pattern into which a hard steel cutting edge (steel) is welded in. These had a yakiba produced by oil tempering, but show no nie or nioi along it. Harry  referred to Murata-to being "superior hand-finished machine-made" swords. <br/>
<br/>
I've had swords which had come through my hands over the years that to my way of thinking, were Murata-to. In the "early days" these would fool me into thinking they were really good swords because of the nice shape to them and (usually) bo hi, but the lack of any grain or nioi/nie would convince me otherwise. I still have a nice "naval dress sword" that I keep because of it being "an example" and that has one of these kind of blades in it. <br/>
<br/>
If you would like a copy of these two articles, email me at: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:swords@...">swords@...</a> and I will scan them for you. Both are brief articles.<br/>
