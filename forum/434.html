<h3>Advice on Similar Tanto</h3>
by <i>nihontochicken</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1896190924">Hey, may as well jump in here and ask about my tanto also.  Please <br/>
refer to the Photos section at left, in the NC folder.  The tanto is <br/>
signed Bishu Osafune Kiyo(mitsu?) and Eiroku jyu ichi (nen?) (?) <br/>
gatsu hi (1568).  Q #1:  Is it indeed kazu uchimono?  Seems so, given <br/>
the Bishu vs. Bizen mei, the date, plus it also has a lot of loose <br/>
hada and forging ware.  Q #2:  Any idea as to which Kiyomitsu made <br/>
it?  Q #3:  Is it common for kazu uchimono of this area and time to <br/>
have loads of utsuri and nijuba/sanjuba as does this example?  That <br/>
is, while the forging was apparently quick and dirty, it appears that <br/>
this blade got the full professional tempering treatment.  Possibly <br/>
the smiths were so used to doing the tempering correctly that they <br/>
just did it as a matter of course, even for bundled blades?  Thanks <br/>
in advance for any and all input!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1319612898">I would be interested in finding the definitive answer for the mass<br/>
produced swords thing.<br/>
<br/>
From what I've read, the "bundled swords" didn't even have a hamon (in<br/>
some cases? Or in all cases?)<br/>
<br/>
Given that you might destroy your poorly made sword, and a poorly made<br/>
sword is even less likely to survive the process, I would think you'd<br/>
just heat the whole thing, quench, sharpen, and toss in the bundle.<br/>
<br/>
It doesn't take that long to heat harden the whole thing, plus will not<br/>
destroy the sword.<br/>
<br/>
On the signature stuff... Bishu = worse than Bizen I understand to apply<br/>
only to Sue Bizen swords. <br/>
<br/>
My *guess* would be that the amount of effort going into cutting the mei<br/>
indicates the care taken... Bishu Osafune Sukesada/Kiyomitsu is easier<br/>
to carve than Bizen Kuni Osafune Ju Sukesada/Kiyomitsu.<br/>
<br/>
As well as no date...<br/>
<br/>
But for these swords that seem to have reasonably good construction, are<br/>
signed Bishu Osafune XX, and have a hamon showing activity... is it fair<br/>
to call those mass produced swords?<br/>
<br/>
After all, the workmanship is showing things not associated with mass<br/>
production. It's only the signature that is saying something. So is it a<br/>
"bad" rule of thumb to judge these exclusively based on signature?<br/>
<br/>
Or are there just different levels to the mass-production. Maybe less<br/>
skilled people/apprentices are given the work of making the Bishu<br/>
Osafune stuff while the talented guys are taking their time with the<br/>
better items?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1864155168">As I understand it Kazu-uchi mono were tempered and complete <br/>
swords. The rules about signatures are general, mediocre works are <br/>
rarely seen with the "full" signatures, however sometimes a well made <br/>
sword may be seen with the "plain" mei.<br/>
