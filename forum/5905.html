 <br/>
I just picked this up at an estate sale..all it is really is the blade and  <br/>
a ratty leather covered siya.. no habaki, just a blade and the siya with <br/>
one  suspension ring.  Supposedly a WWII bring back by a US Marine..the folks  <br/>
said that the rest of the fittings were "around  somewhere"...too bad cause <br/>
 they are probably  worth more than this blade is but...<br/>
 <br/>
Hope the attachment comes through..<br/>
 <br/>
No "damage" to the blade, mei is somewhat clear, rubbed flour into it for  <br/>
contrast. No imperial mum or star chops..anyone have an idea who this is? <br/>
Didn't  pay much for it...not much at all...<br/>

well back to the forges for me.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1242644282">Well, I once went to see a collection of Japanese swords at the request of a man who got my name and phone number from the Japanese Consulate.  He was a very pleasant man who had been collecting 3 years and had 25 swords.  They were all Chinese repros.  Every last Mother of all Fakes one of them.  Not a real Japanese blade there.  Having said that, there were a very few that were worthy of the generic name "sword" as they actually looked good.  They had hamon and hada and a passable sugata.  But they were not Nihonto.<br/>
<br/>
Jim, I'll still bet on the basis of your one photo that your cheap estate pickup is a recent Chinese crapper.  It is a hard call without the blade in hand, but here's looking forward to being found wrong...<br/>

	We need better photos of the entire blade, the entire nakago and then  <br/>
maybe better close-ups of the mei. Based on what I can see; &#30707;&#20809;&#20449;&#20809; <br/>
作　 it looks like a mei but the spacing and such is awful funky, the  <br/>
conclusion that this is a fake is a natural one given what we can see...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1265094585">Hello:<br/>
 <br/>
The more I look at it the more it looks like a non-Japanese origin sword  <br/>
that was passed off as what it isn't..the lack of a Yokote, along with a <br/>
couple  of other things bug me..I paid a whopping $20.00 for this and well, it's <br/>
worth  that to me as a "What NOT to buy" example for my Iai and Batto <br/>
students,  still it has a decent Hamon on it... I had a good idea it wasn't an  <br/>
original..I basically took it cause it does have a nice Hamon.<br/>
 <br/>
Now the ones that I am finishing up making for book IV will in no way ever  <br/>
be confused with ANYTHING original simply by the way I am signing them and <br/>
the  method of polish...You can get a really NICE polish ("working" type) <br/>
just by  using wet/dry paper up to 2500 grit wet and then hit it with 5000 <br/>
pumice in an  oil suspension. NOT for real swords but for "modern Japan-ish" <br/>
stuff that I am  making for cutting up mats and the like...shows nice <br/>
structures within the blade  as well as the Hada on the laminated ones..<br/>
 <br/>
I will just stash this one away for the above purposes....<br/>
 <br/>
Thanks all<br/>
