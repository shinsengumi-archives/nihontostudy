<h3>Seki Kanemasu</h3>
by <i>sworddad</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2005516699">Hi all - <br/>
<br/>
This is directed to anybody out there who might own a sword by Seki Kanemasu. Looking at Nihonto's site today I noticed Fred has a Kanemasu tanto for sale. I own two such tanto by Kanemasu, one having been featured as "Tanto of the Month" in Benson's Bushido publication years ago. <br/>
<br/>
I find it quite curious that all of the Kanemasu tanto I've seen--my own and others illustrated--seem to have two mekugi-ana. One is into the Kane character and the other centered on the nakago above the mei. It makes me wonder if this was a happenchance of remounting or if perhaps it was some sort of "trademark" of this smith. I'd like to find out if any of you own a Kanemasu and if so, how does its nakago/menuki-ana look? Hopefully, one or two will be in your hands. <br/>

 <br/>
<br/>
Such holes are not limited to Kanemasu, but are wide spread among Seki<br/>
blades. I think it is because the original hole was thought too low for Edo<br/>
period mounts. I think you would need to do a comparison of Tensho period<br/>
short sword mounts and later Edo period mounts to confirm that. I might add<br/>
that it is a common complaint among collectors of Seki works in Japan, and<br/>
also adds to the problem of identifying the distinctions among the<br/>
generations if you can't fully read the kane character. There does not seem<br/>
to be the same problem with katana. This would be a good subject for a paper<br/>

Hi all - <br/>
<br/>
This is directed to anybody out there who might own a sword by Seki<br/>
Kanemasu. Looking at Nihonto's site today I noticed Fred has a Kanemasu<br/>
tanto for sale. I own two such tanto by Kanemasu, one having been featured<br/>
as "Tanto of the Month" in Benson's Bushido publication years ago. <br/>
<br/>
I find it quite curious that all of the Kanemasu tanto I've seen--my own and<br/>
others illustrated--seem to have two mekugi-ana. One is into the Kane<br/>
character and the other centered on the nakago above the mei. It makes me<br/>
wonder if this was a happenchance of remounting or if perhaps it was some<br/>
sort of "trademark" of this smith. I'd like to find out if any of you own a<br/>
Kanemasu and if so, how does its nakago/menuki-ana look? Hopefully, one or<br/>
two will be in your hands. <br/>
