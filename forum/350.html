<h3>mekugi ana question</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-955960333">Hi guys,<br/>
 <br/>
I read somewhere that there is a difference in how mekugi ana holes were<br/>
made in old and modern times, I belive drilling vs punching. And that<br/>
one method was used during the war. <br/>
 <br/>
Could someone please explain the difference between these two methods<br/>
(if I got them correct....!) and when they were used.<br/>
 <br/>
Picture examples would be much appreciated as well. <br/>
 <br/>
Regards,<br/>
 <br/>
Matthew. <br/>

Drilling is self-explanatory.  A hole is drilled with a tool steel <br/>
bit.  In punching, the smith heats up the section of the nakago to <br/>
red heat, and using a round steel punch, hammers a deep dimple on one <br/>
side.  He then turns the blade over and centers the punch over the <br/>
dimple on the other side, and whacks it with a hammer.  Done <br/>
correctly, a small, round coin is ejected, and the hole is complete.  <br/>
Fresh punched holes will show rounded shoulders, and may show in the <br/>
interior the section where the little coin broke off.  Drilled holes <br/>
will have sharp, square shoulders, and uniform walls, likely showing <br/>
spiral marks on the sides.  I believe most of the WWII traditional <br/>
nihonto had punched ana, but don't know what percentage of non-<br/>
traditional gunto had drilled ana.<br/>
