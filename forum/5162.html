<br/>
100 pre-med available to change a light bulb , how many needed to  do the job <br/>

Only one and the rest were left wondering why they were not selected.<br/>
Take THAT to your internet marketing focus group  !!<br/>

if you set all NEW member posting parameter to " moderated ", then you can  <br/>
get  the first crack ........or if old members do not behave, you can set  them <br/>
to be moderated or not allow to post message.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1061310408">Milt loves power!  sucks to hear about your account<br/>
Rich.  I got an email I don't think it was from you,<br/>
but I was getting offered a second chance before the<br/>
auction was even over.  That was a big clue!  Always<br/>
go check your emails from ebay through the My ebay<br/>
-message center area,  if it isn't there it didn't go<br/>
through their system.  I thought I got a good deal<br/>
when I won the auction I wonder if they scared off<br/>
bidders?<br/>
<br/>
good luck everyone.  Don't forget to send me any<br/>
mantis items, It was my b-day yesterday and looks like<br/>
I have managed to buy a tsuba, fuchi/kashira, kozuka,<br/>
and I will be bidding on a single mantis menuki<br/>
today/tomorrow better look.  So I almost got a<br/>
complete  set.  Luckily, family comes through with<br/>
monetary gifts so the presents I got myself total<br/>
price tag has been reduced!  I have no control! <br/>
actually it is more like 2 tsuba and maybe 2 F/K.<br/>
whoops! TO the addicted, I salute you.<br/>
