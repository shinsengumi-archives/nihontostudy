<h3>Sukashi tsuba</h3>
by <i>drjohnplissenden</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1541641951">A colleage, and collector, has recently purchased the sukashi tsuba <br/>
illustrated in my Photo Album JPL and has asked for my advice <br/>
regarding its possible attribution and for a translation of the red <br/>
lacquer inscription  The figure on the bottom left appears to be a <br/>
kao, but I am otherwise at a complete loss.  Any help/suggestions re <br/>
either of these requests would be much appreciated.<br/>

While you are in my Photo Album, I am still seeking some information <br/>
on the gold, hira-zogan seal.  There has been a complete absence of <br/>
replies to my earlier request regarding this.<br/>
<br/>
Grateful thanks and regards, JPL.</div>

Without a signature to give me a pointer, it is a<br/>
daunting prospect to go through the volumes of the<br/>
Haynes Index and try to match up your gold seal.<br/>
    Someone more knowledgable may be able to recommend<br/>
a more efficient method.<br/>
<br/>
As to the red lacquer attribution, I cannot see it<br/>
well enough to read. I will try an opinion later today<br/>
after work. Maybe some people will follow suit.<br/>

type of scripts make things difficult and I can't figure out the <br/>
enamel mei on the tsuba. The style seems to be Katchushi, J.</div>

As others have said, today it would probably be attributed to Katchushi.  When I first glanced at the shumei I picked up on the second character as the "a" 阿 in Shoami and then on the next character as the middle kanji 乙 from Saotome.  Of course the rest does not fit either case, although Saotome and Ko-Shoami would be somewhat defensible attributions.  The first kanji looks like ichi/kazu 一 and the last ko 小.  I can't make sense of it, but feel like I must be missing something obvious.  The other character at the left appears to be a kao, although I do not know who it belongs to.<br/>
<br/>
 I also spent time on your gold seal when you posted it, but struck out on that one too.  I don't have a tensho dictionary so I asked my shodo teacher to look it up, but couldn't conclude on any known tsubako.<br/>
<br/>
They're both bugging me, so if I turn anything up I will post it.  Meanwhile, hopefully someone else will take a look and settle it.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry,<br/>

Ichi - yes, but the "mei" in H1715, I have to say no.  The nichi part is not written that way in gyosho or sosho, but the three-stroke radical I mentioned before is.  The getsu part is also not normally written that way even in sosho, but it's at least possible as a variant.  Of course the next two ji are still there to be explained.<br/>
<br/>
Haynes' reference would be to an engraved signature rather than a shumei.<br/>
<br/>
In appraisal documents there is often an "ichi" as in "this item," but I haven't seen it in this sort of shumei.  Of course, most if not all of the shumei I've seen on tsuba have been apocryphal, but usually to some obvious "big name."<br/>
<br/>
Sorry I'm not doing better,<br/>
