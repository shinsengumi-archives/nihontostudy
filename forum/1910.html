<h3>Need help judging Katana age</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1211294304">Hi,<br/>
I'm new to this group and I have a question regarding a recently <br/>
purchased Katana. I purchased the sword from a WW2 veteran who was <br/>
stationed in Japan during and post surrender. My question is that I <br/>
don't know how old the sword is, even though I can see that it's <br/>
extremely old but I can't put an exact date on the sword. If anyone <br/>
can help me with this matter I would be deeply grateful. I uploaded <br/>
close up pictures of the sword into the folder "Bladeben Katana" in <br/>
the photo section. The sword is 25.5 inches in total length and the <br/>
blade is 20.5 inches long. Also, if anyone can tell me from the <br/>
shape, hamon pattern etc. who might have made the sword? I ask this <br/>
as the tang is not signed or might have been but lost over time. I <br/>
eagerly await any responses.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
