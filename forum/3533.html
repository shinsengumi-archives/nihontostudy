Most of the birds pass over way too high for decent photographs.  The counters are busy getting correct ID and count, but there were a few photographers visiting that did get the occasional good photo of a low flying bird.  Unfortunately I don't have any of the pictures.<br/>
<br/>
We counted 8,693 raptors for the season, 14 different species.  There were 86 Bald Eagles, 13 Golden Eagles and 63 Peregrine Falcons.  The most numerous species counted were Broad-winged Hawk (4,249) and Sharp-shinned Hawk (1,990).<br/>

We have 6 local tails at the Chimney Rock site, including one distinctive female that has been seen for the last 16 years.  They're common residents in NJ where they can also be seen every day.  We only counted 117 high flying migrants on our ridge, but most of the northern population moves via the ridges to the west, where the season counts will number in the mid thousands.  Your birds are probably year round residents like ours.<br/>

You have any good pics of the red tail hawks?<br/>
I have loads of Japanese hawk paintings, no red tail hawk among them ( <br/>
most likely they don't have rt hawks there )<br/>
