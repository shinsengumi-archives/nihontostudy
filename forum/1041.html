The tsuba in the background of that page is a solid gold Umetada <br/>
tsuba owned by a friend.  It was on display at the London shinsa (but <br/>
without the music).  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-322186543">cool, thanks Jim. How many tsuba would have been solid gold ?. I am not going to remember the smith but there is a lovely gold foiled/sheet ? plated tsuba ( I think ) in Comptons 100 famous swords. Part of a complete set of koshirae I believe. It features paulownia flowers over waves from memory.<br/>
