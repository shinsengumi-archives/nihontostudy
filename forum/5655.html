<h3>Book Sale: 50% Off - Ending</h3>
by <i>musashibobenkei</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-28595938">I'm ending my 50% off book sale in about 24 hours, midnight Monday local<br/>
time in Chicago (UTC -6). Please see my earlier posting for details and<br/>
limitations on consigned books.<br/>
<br/>
No, I didn't win the lottery, no rich uncle died. It just seems that<br/>
interest has tapered off. I do want to thank all of you who have been<br/>
supportive (and got some great deals!)<br/>
<br/>
As stated before, I have no other job than being a bookseller, and I will<br/>
continue to do that, and offer specials on select books, and the occasional<br/>
update when I list something that I think is worth noting for collectors, if<br/>
only for information purposes. I will describe my stock as accurately as<br/>
possible, price fairly, and ship promptly packed for safe transit.<br/>
<br/>
My last collection of tsuba is still for sale on Boris Markhasin's website,<br/>
[url]www.yamabushiantiques.com[/url], on the consignment page. The prices<br/>
shown were recently reduced from those that were listed in 2009.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
<br/>
Craig<br/>
