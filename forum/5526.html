<h3>Gassan Books</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1776348603">Dear Nihonto Gang,<br/>
<br/>
I have 4 copies of:<br/>
<br/>
JAPANESE MASTER SWORDSMITHS:<br/>
THE GASSAN TRADITION<br/>
Morihiro OGAWA (1989)<br/>
<br/>
They are new, but have been on a shelf for a while. Slight shelf<br/>
damage as a result. Nothing major, and certainly nothing affecting<br/>
the content, text, images, pages, etc. Minor scuffing on cover at<br/>
worst. This is the Boston Museum of Fine Arts catalog on their Gassan<br/>
Exhibition in the '80's, where Gassan-san himself attended and forged<br/>
a sword for the event. Very nice plates and info.<br/>
<br/>
I figured I'd give you guys a shot before I put them on eBay or<br/>
something. I'm asking $100 a copy, and I'll ship for free within the<br/>
U.S., actual shipping charges otherwise. Paypal or deposit to my<br/>
Wachovia account (if that bank still exists by the time you read this<br/>
message) will be fine.<br/>
<br/>
Let me know...<br/>
<br/>
Best,<br/>
<br/>
