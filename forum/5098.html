<br/>
"Nobody here but us chickens" as the old saying goes...yes, it's been downright dead on all the lists. Guess it's the summer doldrums (or winter doldrums) or something. Been spending more hours on my antique beer steins (and some time with the more usable ones, too) instead of swords and fittings. Things might get more active soon. I've got my ticket for the SF show in four weeks and also plan on going back to Japan in late October, my second adventure there. Then we have our KTK weekend coming up in September. <br/>

I can see why you though Akasaka-something but if not that, look at Akao group perhaps. I'm not coming up with any positive thoughts here, just throwing out some idea. Doesn't look Kyo-sukashi to me. As for Echizen...Echizen what? Echizen makes me think Kinai and that's not Kinai work from what I can tell. Nice tsuba. The fukurin could be added later so I guess one should think of it "without" that addition.<br/>

I took your thoughts and will re-opened the books to study the 'AKAO' <br/>
group or Ha. And I will bring Umetada and Akasaka influence's into <br/>
the picture (maybe Shoami).<br/>
<br/>
As far as Echizen (not Kinai), Akao tsubako were there.<br/>
