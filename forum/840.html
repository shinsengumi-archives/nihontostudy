<h3>fuchi/kashira set mei</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1508015173">Hi all - <br/>
<br/>
  While describing a fuchi/kashira set today, one I do not look at very often, my first thought was that it was early work, possibly Momoyama era. Then I realized that it was signed which made me wonder (and my question to you all) if you find Momoyama era fittings very often signed? Well, I guess you do but if so, I have seen very few that were signed. This led me to wonder if this set was really that early or what. Looking in Haynes' books I do not see a Muneyoshi (kao) referenced--without kao, yes, but none with kao. Could read Soyoshi, sokichi...maybe something totally different?  Hopefully the links will work (in Yahoo pictures) and if so, I would appreciate any comments that you may have as to when these were made and what era. (apologies for the poor photo...mei is fine, though.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-271229737">Thanks Rich. I might have to repost this query again. Forgot about Jim and Gordon both being in the UK this past week. Looking at the set again yesterday, I have gained a new appreciation of it and can see why it was purchased several years ago. It certainly looks Momoyama era work and fits the bill for early f/k style as described by Gordon during his exhibit talks. If that early I would think the mei would be kind of unique to find.  <br/>
