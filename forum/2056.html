<h3>Questions on 2 tsuba</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-668818581">Dear Listeros:<br/>
<br/>
I was wondering if you could help me out on these 2 tsuba.<br/>
<br/>
First is Yamakichibei:<br/>

Note that the plate looks old, old traces of lacquer and the tsuba <br/>
is of 3 plate construction (two thin outer layers and a thicker core-<br/>
you can see it in the hitsui ana).<br/>
Which generation?<br/>
<br/>
Second I have never seen a tsuba like this:<br/>

That decoration around the hitsuana is a trait of one of the late generation people.   "Owari to Mikawa no Tsubako" specifically outlines the work of four Yamakichi generations and then identifies this type as later work. I have seen this type of guard receive a kanteisho, but they are not held in the same regard as early Yamakichibei tsuba.<br/>
<br/>
What is the other guard made out of?  I have seen Kagamishi tsuba with that "worm eaten" design.  I haven't specifically seen it combined with mon like that, but I have seen the worm eaten rim combined with other motifs.  So, not unusual if it is done in a copper-based alloy with a dark patina.  <br/>
<br/>
The photos make it look like an iron guard, and if it is then that is something I haven't seen before.  In that case I would guess that it's a cast taken from a Kagamishi tsuba.<br/>

The eccentric proportions and shape of the ana and the small seppa dai aren't unusual for Muromachi period guards of this type (if it is a legitimate one).  I don't know about that seller so I can't comment about his stuff.  If this is a cast iron copy it probably is modern.  A lot of the modern Chinese fakes do get the proportions all wrong, so it's a matter of learning about early sword mountings.<br/>
<br/>
Many early "katana-type" mountings had saya and tsuka that were much thinner than what became the convention during and after the Edo period.  Hence the seppa dai (sized to match the saya and tsuka) are small.  The early kozuka and kogai were often very thin, so the ana made to match them are narrow.  They were sometimes mounted at angles slightly off from the later 9:00, 3:00 standard.  Also at times it was the fashion to mount rather small guards on large blades, leaving behind nakago-ana that look disproportionately large.  <br/>
<br/>
Of course guards from these early mountings are pretty rare, so chances are that some misshapen thing on ebay is just a modern fake.  <br/>

Too bad that it isn't.  I suppose it's possible that someone could carve a kagamishi-style guard from iron.  The Edo period Shoami did make some guards that were carved to imitate natural old-style workings of the plate.  But the large, irregular nakago-ana sure looks like what you find on old soft metal tsuba.  It's worth studying it carefully to be sure that it isn't something legit and very unusual, even though I think that's a long shot.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone seen another "iron Kagamishi" like this?  (Not from the inventory of bad feedback ebay sellers.)<br/>

<h3>tsuba update</h3>
by <i>bungotakadasword</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1645108108">gang,<br/>
a while back, I bought a tanto with full koshirae ( minus the koz but <br/>
thanks to one listeros, i found a match ).<br/>
<br/>
The tsuba is that of a dragon ascending mt. Fuji.<br/>
After failing the magnet test, we determined it is of copper alloy ( <br/>
shakudo ? ) to simulate iron.<br/>
<br/>
I was looking at the Compton collection.............lo und behold I <br/>
found an almost identical design tsuba  with the exception of the <br/>
tsuba shape + mei ( mine is mumei ) .<br/>
If you have the Compton Christie's auction catalog, it's item # 179 ( <br/>
volume 1 ) page 74-75.<br/>
The dragon is identical, the cloud+ Mt. Fuji is almost identical.<br/>
Compton's is listed as a Yanagawa school ( signed   Yanagawa Naoharu <br/>
Isen  Noobushu ). The reverse also shows a Mt. Fuji in reflection.<br/>
<br/>
Just thought you all may be interested to know..........<br/>
<br/>
p.s.  Gorby,  figure out the  school of that sukashi tsuba yet ?<br/>

The two most concentrated sources on the subject that I can think of are:<br/>

"Tosogu no Kigen" by Sasano Masayuki, Nichibo Shuppansha, 1979 <br/>
<br/>
and<br/>

"Uchigatana Koshirae," Tokyo National Museum, 1987 <br/>

They're primarily in Japanese, but both have some information in English and plenty of illustrations.  They also seem to be available on the market these days.

Dr. Torigoye's Kansho-ki is a favorite book of mine! Lots of wonderful tsuba, many early. <br/>
<br/>
Later, I hope to post a photo of a wonderful "worm eaten" ko-kinko tsuba I've had for probably 30 years. Never put through a shinsa, but exciting treatment and technique.<br/>
