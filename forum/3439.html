<div id="ygrps-yiv-44415342">Some of my friends have managed to meet a few nice ones off this thing (here is the place they told me: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.meetingherenow.info/tbibl">http://www.meetingherenow.info/tbibl</a> , but what do you guys reckon? Myself, I actually think it is pretty awesome from what I've seen, and Im considering getting          on there later on this evening. If you don't know what it is, basically its like a matchingplace, but has few added things I noticed. Stuff like messenger, vidchat, picsrate, etc. Best part is you can talk to ppl on vidchat even if you don't have it enabled yourself.</div>
