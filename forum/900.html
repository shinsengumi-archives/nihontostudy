<h3>one heck of a tanto...more comments</h3>
by <i>ashigaru1</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-430694211">After having time beween work assignments, i looked at the blade <br/>
again. and have further comments.<br/>
 1st - I understand that extra mekugi ana might mean new tsuka were <br/>
put on, but why not use the old ana?  Surely, a suitable mekugi could <br/>
be made to fit an old ana.  so my question remains, why the three <br/>
mekugi ana?<br/>
<br/>
  2nd - The blade is over priced, at least from the prices I have <br/>
seen on much more interesting looking Koto tanto on the web that had <br/>
papers, were ubu, mumei, and even came in full koshire, that were <br/>
much less expensive.  I am most likely wrong on this. <br/>
<br/>
  3ird - If the seller is who i suspect & living in Montreal (see e-<br/>
bay seller profiel), he his very well thought of, judging from the <br/>
comments on his web site. I will not give that address out since he <br/>
might care to remain unkown on e-bay, but the elder members I am sure <br/>
know who I am talking about.<br/>
<br/>
Lastly, I apologise for talking so much, as a new member and novice <br/>
to Nihon-to.  I find the whole subject exciting and tend to run on & <br/>
on.  I am sure this enthusiasim will fade somewhat over the years, <br/>
and burnish to a soft cynisim.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1856407591">Hi Doug, <br/>
 <br/>
I don't think the blade is overpriced.............. it is a rare work by<br/>
a highly rated smith with Tok. Hozon papers. Granted he is not giving it<br/>
away, but the big "name" dealers would certainly not charge less than<br/>
this in my opinion (infact probably at least a couple of thousand<br/>
more..............), and it has provenance (where the seller purchased<br/>
it). It is not one of those "finds" which usually turn out to be alot<br/>
less grand than stated by the seller. <br/>
 <br/>
Anyway it doesn't make much difference to me as I can't afford it at the<br/>
moment, but if I could I would seriously consider it. I believe Robert<br/>
referred to this blade earlier as having an "etched" design ? No such<br/>
thing, this is a genuine piece of art. Not some piece of Chinese<br/>
rubbish. <br/>
 <br/>
And ofcourse anything koto Soshu den is going to cost you an arm and a<br/>
leg. There seem to be more collectors in that area, generally driving<br/>
prices up. <br/>
 <br/>
Well I believe I have said enough now considering I still know nothing<br/>
in the big scheme of things hahahahahah. Anyone who wants to put their<br/>
foot in my mouth, feel most welcome. <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > yeah, that's who i was thinking of...<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It illustrates nicely the danger of making assumptions. I think the<br/>
second statement you made about the pricing is also not based on good<br/>
research.<br/>
<br/>
I'm the owner of the tanto. <br/>
<br/>
So I obviously disagree about the pricing aspect (which was actually set<br/>
for me by one of the most respected members of the non-Japanese sword<br/>
community), but it's kind of pointless to try to argue that kind of<br/>
thing. I'll settle for explaining how I look at pricing for any<br/>
particular piece.<br/>
<br/>
Pricing is subjective to begin with, and your model for finding a<br/>
fitting replacement for this piece in the marketplace I think is missing<br/>
out on several aspects.<br/>
<br/>
Some aspects of a collectable piece can be compared and contrasted<br/>
simply. The habaki, the sayagaki, the shirasaya, the papers. The costs<br/>
of these are all fairly flat and known and can be added into the bottom<br/>
line and calculated easily.<br/>
<br/>
Beyond that, "koto tanto" is a very broad and vague term, kind of<br/>
equivalent to saying "old painting."<br/>
<br/>
There are "old paintings" available for next to nothing, and some "old<br/>
paintings" are priced in the hundred million dollar range. If you are<br/>
just in the market for an "old painting" with price as your guide, then<br/>
pretty much everything by comparison is overpriced vs. anything from the<br/>
bargain bin.<br/>
<br/>
Where you really want to start with a piece like this I think is with<br/>
the smith, rather than the period, and his ratings and valuations.<br/>
<br/>
Naotsuna is a very famous smith, he is one of the "Masamune Juttetsu"<br/>
though modern scholarship considers he probably had no direct<br/>
relationship. Some still believe, but regardless of either, he is part<br/>
of the old stories. He is considered Jo-jo saku by Fujishiro, and this<br/>
is a very high rating achieved by very few smiths. <br/>
<br/>
He is also rated at 850 man yen in the Toko Taikan, or 8.5 million yen<br/>
for a Juyo Token daito quality piece. Cut that in half for a tanto. Some<br/>
might say the piece has to be signed, but for many of these smiths there<br/>
are no signed works and it is not clear that the Toko Taikan was<br/>
intended to be used like that. Rather, if you use a "high" Juyo Token as<br/>
the basis I think it works better.<br/>
<br/>
So beginning with 4.25M yen, we can split that in half again for a<br/>
Tokubetsu Hozon piece. So now we're down to about 2.12 million yen. <br/>
<br/>
We can probably split that in half because the piece has endured many<br/>
polishes. I am trying to not nickel and dime this on the way down.<br/>
<br/>
This gives us 1.05 million yen. Since tanto are rare in the scope of<br/>
Naotsuna's work, this makes the piece more attractive. Say add<br/>
10%. Horimono add I think 20% to the value of a work, and since horimono<br/>
are virtually non-existent in the body of Naotsuna's work, we can add<br/>
perhaps another 5%. That works out to about 1.46M yen, or around<br/>
$12,700.00.<br/>
<br/>
This number probably includes something like the dollars spent on<br/>
papering, but may not include the factors such as the quality of the<br/>
habaki (gold foil, silver foil, solid, etc) and the sayagaki. In a lower<br/>
priced piece like this, it is fair to weigh out these aspects.<br/>
<br/>
I tried to use commonly accepted values in the calculation, but each<br/>
person may have their own subjective valuation for each aspect that may<br/>
change the total. And that is how things should be, some aspects do not<br/>
matter to some people, and they do to others. Ideally, you want to come<br/>
to some kind of collective representation in your pricing model that<br/>
embraces as much as possible.<br/>
<br/>
I mentioned up top that I sought out advice from one of the most<br/>
knowledgable and respected members of the community before I set my<br/>
pricing, and I priced it in line with his instructions.<br/>
<br/>
With the "valued" pricing in mind, one has to remember that the ideal<br/>
price for any unique item like this should be considered "too high" by<br/>
at least 95% of the people considering it. That is, most should look at<br/>
the piece and weigh out in favor of keeping their cash in their wallet.<br/>
<br/>
If you have priced something so that 95% of the people considering it<br/>
will exchange cash for the piece you are selling, this means you have<br/>
come in far below fair market pricing and have caused yourself<br/>
injury. If you have priced it such that 100% of the people find it too<br/>
expensive, well then it will sit there forever and you will end up<br/>
repricing it in the future :-).<br/>
<br/>
Because most people may not buy it at a given price, doesn't mean<br/>
something is overpriced.<br/>
<br/>
I'm really uncomfortable with having to come out and make a comment, but<br/>
as you had already erred on the seller, I felt that it was important for<br/>
me to at least defend my decisions as there is some rationality behind<br/>
them. And, as I mentioned, it was mostly based on the advice of someone<br/>
with 30+ years of experience doing this.<br/>
<br/>
Lastly, I am not a dealer, I am just a collector and am going to have to<br/>
rotate pieces out of my collection from time to time. <br/>
<br/>
To conclude, I personally think that this is an example of why pricing<br/>
discussions should be kept off the nihonto study list (at least). In the<br/>
end they're a matter for subjectivity, and careless comments about who<br/>
owns what, and what is priced where can cause people a lot of injury.<br/>
<br/>
Those are more appropriately comments to reserve to private<br/>
conversations, where if you are incorrect on anything, the scope of<br/>
damage you can cause is much smaller than when it's yelled from the<br/>
rooftops. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
