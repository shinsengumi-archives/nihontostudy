<h3>Endangered Japanese Stingrays?</h3>

<br/>
I recently bought a sword from a very reputable dealer (zero <br/>
complaints as regards the dealer) and then had somewhat of a bad <br/>
situation when it came to the shipping company. The sword was coming <br/>
from Canada, and the dealer used UPS Overnight Express and gave me <br/>
tracking info.<br/>
<br/>
The sword was delayed for a couple of days at the Louisville UPS <br/>
Receiving Center, and according to their website, a "non-customs <br/>
agency" was delaying it. After another day, I was contacted by a UPS <br/>
representative. I'd been worried that suddenly swords were illegal <br/>
here in the US or something, but no.<br/>
<br/>
Bizarre as it may sound, the problem was the same (wrapping). U.S. <br/>
Fish & Wildlife had decided they wanted to know exactly what species <br/>
of stingray had been used in making the wrapping!!! I explained to <br/>
the young lady that these wrappings had been done in Japan, sometimes <br/>
centuries back, and save DNA testing or a reliable time machine, no <br/>
one was going to get the exact species.<br/>
<br/>
This is the first time I've ever heard of this happening, and the <br/>
dealer was equally surprised and perplexed.<br/>
<br/>
In the end the UPS girl said she'd put in the commonest species in <br/>
the form, and hope for the best. A couple of days later it was <br/>
finally released, and the sword is now in my hands.<br/>
<br/>
Again, I can't stress enough how good the dealer was throughout, I'll <br/>
let him identify himself if he wants to, but I wanted to send this <br/>
note out as a warning to anyone bringing swords into the U.S. through <br/>
UPS, especially if the shipment clears customs through Louisville. <br/>
UPS Louisville was recently declared a Wildlife Preservation Clearing <br/>
station, according to the UPS lady. She added that Fish & Wildlife is <br/>
going to take a higher interest in this, and since I doubt any civil <br/>
servant (always excepting any who might be on this list) have a clue <br/>
as to what a nihonto is, more problems are likely.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone else seen anything like this?<br/>
