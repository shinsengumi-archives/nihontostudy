<h3>wabi-sabi..................... NOT</h3>
by <i>bungotakadasword</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1529426379">ye all,<br/>
the question of wabi-sabi has been discussed recently on various <br/>
message bds.<br/>
May be an example of what's NOT wabi-sabi can illustrate the concept <br/>
better ?<br/>

there's nothing " melancholy/rustic " about this tsuba.<br/>
This one is large and heavy, completely covered with gold foil ( but <br/>
seams canot be detected )and the rim could be bound by solid gold ( a <br/>
small but more than 1mm deep cut on the mimi doesn't not show brown <br/>
color as  the seppa-dai area ). This is a totally  " in your face <br/>
gaudy " tsuba which , in my opinion, is not what wabi-sabi stands for.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
question..........<br/>
1. are those marks on the seppa dai " secret marks " to identify the <br/>
maker/school ?<br/>
2. Professor Fox Fellman raise the point of a " daimyo tsuba ", is <br/>
there such a category as Daimyo tsuba ? Personally I think this is <br/>
more like a presentation tsuba to some " higher level " samurai ( or <br/>
on a bad day, some freakingly rich merchants' play thing ).<br/>
<br/>
 Thoughts, anyone ?<br/>
