<h3>tsuba in &quot;To-Ron&quot;</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1400535855">Just got the Jan 05 NCJSC "To-Ron" and have a question<br/>
about the tsuba at the bottom of page 3 - the Ho bird over<br/>
paulownia.<br/>
<br/>
What school is this? The elongated hitsu-ana and other work<br/>
makes me think Saotome. What appears to be the acid etched<br/>
design makes me think Hoan but Saotome also did that style<br/>
work.<br/>
<br/>
I wish the publisher would be sure to include translations<br/>
and/or attributions for all the photos in To-Ron. It would<br/>
really be very helpful.<br/>

I think that style of etching would get it attributed to late Hoan.  The plate is consistent with late Hoan work that I have seen.  I'm not sure what to make of the cut cross hatching above the sukashi design.  It looks more like an irregular basketwork pattern than a nunome ground.<br/>
