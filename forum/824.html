<h3>Han Bing Siong passed away</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-456254305">Forward from Rich T's message board:<br/>
<br/>
I have just received an email from a Oranda Token Kai member telling <br/>
me on the passing yesterday of Han Bing<br/>
      Siong. He was well known for his pentrating erudite scholarly <br/>
works that reguarly appeared in the English and<br/>
      Japanese language sword journals like Token Bijutsu, JSS/US and <br/>
Token Society of Great Britain. <br/>
<br/>
      I shall never forget how he answered every query I had however <br/>
insignificant and always had time for the younger<br/>
      element. He once wrote, 'I don't feel its a waste of time to <br/>
answer any thing you ahve to write Yahya for you are next<br/>
      generation that must carry on what he started after the war.'<br/>
<br/>
      RIP good friend<br/>
<br/>
      We'll miss you.<br/>

 I have been away for a few days and seeing this message today has come<br/>
as a shock and with it a real feeling of loss. While we have never met in<br/>
person, I corresponded with Mr. Han for many years and always found his<br/>
letters full of scholarship and interesting insights. While there are now<br/>
more and more well informed and scholarly people outside Japan, I<br/>
believe Mr. Han was without peer and his passing will leave a void that<br/>
will not be filled in the near future. His knowledge and analytical mind<br/>
has been noted widely inside Japan and out, and the sword community has<br/>
lost a true friend. I understand that his latest work, a compendium of<br/>
swords found and recorded in the Netherlands and rendered in English, is<br/>
soon to leave the printer. I am sure it will stand as a lasting monument<br/>
to his scholarship. I extend my prayerful sympathy to all of those who<br/>
knew him personally.<br/>
