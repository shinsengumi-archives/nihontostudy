<h3>Recent acquisition baffles me</h3>
by <i>grandone0</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1768886393">I recently acquired a katana that the seller swears is Japanese.  He <br/>
says it is 130 to 140 yeears old.  I've never seen one like it <br/>
before. It's saya is made of bamboo.  The tsuba is gold or brass with <br/>
what look like narcissus flowers and pods.  The blade is forged but <br/>
doesn't appear to be high-quality steel (hamon is midare).  The <br/>
kojiri of the saya is flared.  The kissaki is O and the mune is <br/>
ihori. The boshi is midare-komi on one side and almost Jizo on the <br/>
other.  Nakago appears to be tanago. The ji has what looks like long <br/>
faint lotus flowers decorating it.<br/>
<br/>
More strangely, there is no kashira, same, ito, menuki, on the tsuka, <br/>
which I believe is made of wood, rather than bamboo.<br/>
<br/>
I ran the characters past a Korean and a Chinese woman and neither <br/>
could tell me anything. No surprise there, however I couldn't <br/>
identify the characters in either the Japanese or Chinese character <br/>
references on the Web.<br/>
<br/>
If any of you fine scholars can tell me what Ive gotten myself into, <br/>
or where it might actually be from and when, I would appreciate it.<br/>
Please respond to the group and to my email address: <br/>

Thanks so much for reading all this.<br/>

Once upon a time I saw a kowakizashi saya that looked like it was "made of<br/>
bamboo".  It was, in fact, one of the most skillfully executed lacquer works I<br/>
have ever seen.  No doubt about it - real urushi.  It had leaves and minute ants<br/>
also in lacquer - oh, and signed as well.  It left me gobsmacked.  This was<br/>
really, really top class work.  Way beyond my pocket...<br/>

<h3>KINKI NIHONTO GAKKAI</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1647004309">All, I have had a member as me about a kanteisho from a group known as <br/>
the KINKI NIHONTO GAKKAI. The paper is signed by a Mr KORYU TERAMINE ( <br/>
Teramune ? ) Does anyone have any information on this group ?, is it a <br/>
Shop perhaps ?.<br/>
