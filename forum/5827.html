I have had the Kaga Kinko Taikan for many years and recently purchased a quiet Maeda mon mitokoromono of Kaga work. I just passed on a nice Kaga Goto kozuka that I did like but felt was priced too high. It seems July would be a good month to devote to the study of Kaga Kinko.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone has any papered Kaga Kinko or Kaga Goto items, I'd love to see any pictures and share any insights into these works.<br/>
<br/>
I wish a good 4th of July to the USA members.<br/>

You couldn't have picked a better school to study.  I too have had taikan and find it to be just pure drooling material.  Even if you separate the fact that the schooled recognized the mantis in a lot of their works (just showing their high class taste), their mastery over kinko work is clearly demonstrated over and over.  The Maeda family did a good job in sponsoring the local talent to say the least!  Would love to see/hear and feel (you really can feel the quality in their work), but I would settle for any info you can share.  Good luck with it.<br/>
