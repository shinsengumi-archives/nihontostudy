<div id="ygrps-yiv-1698324215">Hi David,<br/>
<br/>
  I am just back from my holiday. I went to the Sothebys sale, but as I <br/>
wanted to bid on one of the lots I had to miss the viewing. The sale was <br/>
well attended, with<br/>
  quite a few Japanese dealers and I was told some from Taiwan as <br/>
well.There were I believe some Americans,  Europeans and the usual <br/>
suspects from the UK.<br/>
  Prices were mostly over estimate so no doubt Neil Davey who was <br/>
conducting the auction was well pleased. I left after some sixty lots <br/>
had passed because<br/>
  I wanted to see the swords at Christies. I looked at about thirty five <br/>
of the best swords but after that I had to stop. My eyes could not take <br/>
in any more. You can only<br/>
  really look at a small number at any one time. I came to the conclusion <br/>
that I would be happy to take home perhaps five of the swords, the rest, <br/>
some big names among<br/>
  them, were not for me. You will know that at the sale prices went <br/>
through the roof, but I am still not convinced that a number of the <br/>
swords were correct. I was also<br/>
  interested to see Caldwell's well known Ko Mino tsuba. It was much <br/>
better in the hand than in the pictures I have seen of it, and I liked <br/>
it very much. I have always<br/>
  doubted though that it was Ko Mino, and as it sold for just over a <br/>
thousand I guess that the Japanese doubted it as well. Ko kinko perhaps? <br/>
My friend is still ill so<br/>
  our discussions were limited but he thought that the kyo attribution of <br/>
our tsuba was more than likely correct. My own thoughts still linger on <br/>
Shoami but in the best<br/>
  Japanese tradition I bow before the pronouncement of the Sensei.<br/>
<br/>
  Kind regards,  Charles.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Two of those I think the prices confirmed that most people thought were<br/>
not correct... there was a Kinju that seemed wrong to me, and that went<br/>
cheap, then there was a Yukimitsu tanto that also seemed wrong to me and<br/>
that also went for cheap. The nakago just didn't look right on this<br/>
tanto, and the workmanship in the blade was a bit pedestrian and not<br/>
what one would expect for this smith... in my opinion. <br/>
<br/>
A couple others were like this to me as well... the Yukimitsu daito I<br/>
had qualms about, and the Chogi wakizashi. <br/>
<br/>
I'm curious what your thoughts were about the other blades and which<br/>
were the five you'd like to have taken home?<br/>
