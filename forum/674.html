They're usually some sort of paint.  They tend to be brittle enough to flake off safely with a sharp tool that's not hard enough to scratch the patina.

<h3>Re: [nihontostudy] Re: tsuba school</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1124401459">I am new to the group and am enjoying reading about the nuances of tsuba connoiseurship and<br/>
collecting.  As an art conservator (though generally art on paper, not metals) I'm able to give a<br/>
little bit of professional info on this one. <br/>
In the museum world, the general method for labeling objects is to first put down a coat, acting<br/>
as a barrier layer, of some sort of clear polymer. Nowadays it is usually a non-yellowing product<br/>
called paraloid B-72 which is soluble in toluene and/or xylene.  Sometimes, clear nail polish is<br/>
used which is soluble in acetone.  The ID# is then painted on this, and a second coat of the<br/>
polymer is used to make everything stay put.<br/>
I suppose some private collectors wouldn't hesitate to just use something like white-out or<br/>
liquid-paper for numbering.  This will chip off easily.  In instances where things are more<br/>
difficult, and you risk scratching the delicate metal surface, try a q-tip swab with a little of<br/>
the above mentioned solvents and it should do the trick.<br/>

It's sahari as Arnold and Rich have said.  It's not Hazama school sahari work though, which is the flush style of inlay that Arnold mentioned.  I've seen several pieces of exactly this type, but no signed ones.  The plates look like later Myochin work.  On the ones I've seen in person the sahari appeared contemporary with the plate.  It's possible that the sahari could be a later addition, but it's hardly something done to appeal to western taste.<br/>
<br/>
I don't think that the overlapping squares add up to a genji mon.<br/>

Do you have an alternative interpretation to Genji mon?  <br/>
<br/>
My impression is that the goal of applying the melted sahari to the surface is to produce the appearance of the bottom of a tidal pool or puddle.  Would you agree with that?<br/>
<br/>
This tsuba is very difficult to photograph.  Its surface is very high relief, and the sahari is reflective.  The seller's photos are better than any I've been able to make.  It looks a bit better in person.  It's "mud puddle" surface manages to convey simultaneously a sense of rustic wabe sabe simplicity and a sense that this is a really expensive luxury object which took an awful lot of trouble and skill to produce.  Rusticity as sold at Tiffany's, if you see what I mean.  <br/>

  It's sahari as Arnold and Rich have said.  It's not Hazama school sahari work though, which is the flush style of inlay that Arnold mentioned.  I've seen several pieces of exactly this type, but no signed ones.  The plates look like later Myochin work.  On the ones I've seen in person the sahari appeared contemporary with the plate.  It's possible that the sahari could be a later addition, but it's hardly something done to appeal to western taste.<br/>
<br/>
  I don't think that the overlapping squares add up to a genji mon.<br/>

    I'm probably misusing the term shakudo.  Perhaps it's "melted-on something-or-other zogan."   The tsuba is definitely old.  I do own a nice collection of Tokyo Planning Office beer coasters and paperweights, all made last week.    <br/>

<h3>Kantei</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1594939176">Greeting's all. I guess this question may be directed to Jim more than<br/>
anyone else, but I am sure others will be more than keen to jump in if<br/>

<br/>
Are there ever any or many Tsuba or Tosogu Kantei ? I am sure there are<br/>
at group/club meetings and such but I was thinking more in line with the<br/>
Nihonto Kantei the NTHK offer in their monthly or Kenji Mishina offers<br/>
on-line.<br/>
<br/>
The recent post's in regards to David and Curran's guards, with the<br/>
answers that ensued, got me thinking it would be great to see maybe 1/2<br/>
a dozen tsuba offered up each month for kantei. I guess the usual<br/>
aspects of kantei would remain the same, i.e. style, type of work, size,<br/>
thickness, tekkotsu if there and either an image with the mei ( if<br/>
applicable ) hidden or some sort.<br/>

<br/>
I have studied the work of the Yoshiro and have never encountered a work in this style attributed to any of the Yoshiro workers.  The tsuba in question does not seem to me to have the age to the plate to justify such an attribution.<br/>
<br/>
The metal in the plate, at least in the picture, shows no resemblance to any of the plates worked by the Yoshiro artists.  Also the theme and design is not one that they were know to produce.  <br/>
<br/>
They were a very popular group in their day, their work was in high demand and available only to the wealthy.  I find it difficult to believe that they would produce something so drastically different from what their bread and butter products were.<br/>

supply of items published eg. in the Token Bijutsu, that if <br/>
permission obtained has all the leg work done and relatively good <br/>

that could be archived and available to download for private <br/>

inconvenient to look through back issues. A thought. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-486683630">Hi Jim, here is my attempt<br/>
<br/>
Interesting guard. There is an almost identical one in the Sasano <br/>
Masterpiece book, under Owari. but the work on that guard is a little <br/>
finer. Also, this kantei piece is quite thick for the average Owari work <br/>
but that won't preclude it for me. However, with the very strong <br/>
carving, it's thickness, tekkotsu and and elongated seppa dai, I will <br/>
for either go for Early Edo Kaneyama, or Late Muromachi/Momoyama Owari. <br/>
I am tempted to go for the Kaneyama kantei.<br/>
<br/>
My bid is Early Edo Kaneyama.<br/>

  As far as I know it has not been published, but it has been exhibited at a couple of study meetings.  So, if you've already seen it and remember the attribution, please don't post the answer to the list.  It is mumei and there are two almost equally reasonable attributions, but I think that there is more evidence for one than the other.<br/>

  Respond with your bid on or off list as you prefer.<br/>

Please bear in mind i am a novice at tsuba study, but this is so interesting <br/>
i have to give it a shot......... The metal has a unique "look", i have only <br/>
seen that in a few tsuba. The style and workmanship do give me the thought <br/>
of Hoan or Yagyu, but  as another option the color and texture  reminds me <br/>
of a Yamakichibei tsuba, so my guess is Yamakichibei. I look forward to <br/>
learning from the answer.<br/>

I would like this. I hope others will share in kind.<br/>
  I am in the process of trying to improve my<br/>
photography of tsuba, and would be willing to put up<br/>
some of mine, along with relevant drawings, as a<br/>
'dissection' of them as I currently understand them.<br/>
But it would be best to do so with only NTHK or NBTHK<br/>
papered pieces. Afraid many of those I have at hand<br/>
currently are not papered. Still, willing to<br/>
try-though my questionable photography skills may<br/>
scuttle the effort. <br/>
