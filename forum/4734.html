<div id="ygrps-yiv-1026905636">Nihonto People,<br/>
<br/>
I haven't seen a whole lot of books on Yari and/or Naginata in <br/>
English, so even though it was a bit pricy, I purchased Roald and <br/>
Susan Knutsen's book (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://tinyurl.com/yxlhuj)">http://tinyurl.com/yxlhuj)</a>. I just finished it. <br/>
I am very impressed and sorry I did not purchase it earlier. The <br/>
concise yet informative text plus the wealth of drawings and plates <br/>
was well worth the price.<br/>
<br/>
If there's anyone else out there interested in the subject and that <br/>
has been on the fence about this great book because of the price tag, <br/>
well, stop considering it and buy it. Give it to yourself for <br/>
Christmas. You won't regret it.<br/>
<br/>
And if Roald and Susan subscribe to these lists (or someone who knows <br/>
them does) please receive a big thank you  from me... This book will <br/>
be a permanent part of my reference library.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone have any other books on Yari and/or Naginata they want to <br/>
recommend? I'm thirsty for more knowledge now.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2053135869">Hi Mark, Pole arms have always been synonymous with defense against <br/>
cavalry throughout history and throughout the world. It is amazing <br/>
how similar weapons and strategies develop as a result of similar <br/>
necessities. Anyhow, with the development of the teppo and the <br/>
greater use of ashigaru in melee use of the pole arm declined, <br/>
however it never disappeared as a strategic weapon against cavalry. <br/>
If I recall correctly even during the American civil war there were <br/>
troops of billmen to repulse cavalry attack. The spear in many <br/>
cultures was the primary weapon as was the yari on early <br/>
battlefields. Again surviving until the 19th century including for <br/>
example the various mounted lancers brigades. Polearms are a vital <br/>
part of Japanese history and can't be ignored, these books help. John<br/>

Thanks for the info on Kendo World and the Naginata book. I'll look <br/>
into it. I am a "practitioner", although the weapon I mostly train <br/>
with is the katana. Nonetheless, I started training with naginata, <br/>
too, about, oh, 3 years ago. I'm still a rank beginner, but I'm very <br/>
much interested in it as a weapon. I also started training in Yari <br/>
around the same time. But while I practice and learn katana waza <br/>
weekly, or sometimes more often, I do naginata and yari maybe once a month.<br/>

A number of years back a group of women from the Chicago area put on an absolutely awesome demonstration of naginata usage, the first (and last) I've ever experienced. It would be an interesting demonstration to again present at one of our sword shows particularly for us non-martial arts guys and gals. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1144974581">Just ordered a copy. Thanks for the heads-up Andres. Yes, I have considered that book whenever it came to mind but being a procrastinator...so now it's done! (Old guys need a push sometimes!)<br/>
<br/>
Back in the '80s Roland Knutsen wrote an article on polearms for the JSS/US Newsletter. I'll have to dig that out and have look at it again; if so, I'll pass on the issue number for those interested (who have back issues). I could never forget the article because he submitted in in longhand and being unfamiliar with many of the terms he used, it was a bear to type up (before computers) for that issue. Drove me nuts, but I was thrilled to have the material. Again, I'll try to find out when this was done and will pass that info on.<br/>

Thanks for the info on Kendo World and the Naginata book. I'll look<br/>
into it. I am a "practitioner"-, although the weapon I mostly train<br/>
with is the katana. Nonetheless, I started training with naginata,<br/>
too, about, oh, 3 years ago. I'm still a rank beginner, but I'm very<br/>
much interested in it as a weapon. I also started training in Yari<br/>
around the same time. But while I practice and learn katana waza<br/>
weekly, or sometimes more often, I do naginata and yari maybe once a month.<br/>
<br/>
Best Regards,<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Mark,<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the info on Kendo World and the Naginata book. I'll look<br/>
into it. I am a "practitioner"-, although the weapon I mostly train<br/>
with is the katana. Nonetheless, I started training with naginata,<br/>
too, about, oh, 3 years ago. I'm still a rank beginner, but I'm very<br/>
much interested in it as a weapon. I also started training in Yari<br/>
around the same time. But while I practice and learn katana waza<br/>
weekly, or sometimes more often, I do naginata and yari maybe once a month.<br/>
<br/>
Best Regards,<br/>
<br/>
Andres<br/>
