I'm not sure what it is you are really asking.  Surely the answers to both your questions were apparent when you acquired the swords.<br/>
<br/>
Firstly, a caveat: The picture isn't clear enough or detailed enough to tell much.  Having said that, my impression is that they are modern reproductions.  Cost??  Not much compared to real swords.<br/>
