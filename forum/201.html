<div id="ygrps-yiv-15290323">I thought Mr. Haynes made some excellent points and organizational suggestions.  He is certainly entirely correct about the Japanese sword hobby being dominated by a dealer's mentality.  I personally am involved in a number of areas of avocational collecting, and I never seen another area of interest where so large a percentage of collectors are also dealers.  An implicit paradigm of "find a sword, polish the sword, paper the sword, sell the sword to a Japanese buyer" lurks as a hidden goal assumption throughout the hobby.  <br/>
<br/>
I often marvel myself about the consequent universal American acceptance of Japanese preferences and tastes, for example the preference for owning a little-used ubu Koto sword over a well-worn suriage sword with a nakago full of holes testifying to considerable active use.  The former may have simply sat in a temple for centuries, while the latter perhaps actively participated in some of the great events of Japanese history.  <br/>

  Sorry, hit the "send" key by accident...<br/>

  I found it interesting to read Bob's comments regarding the intended goal of the JSS/US when it was formed back in the late '50s and also how today's world of collecting outside of Japan takes on primarily a "buy and sell" atmospher, that nobody puts on an exhibit purely for study as was done a few times in the past.  <br/>
<br/>
  Not going anywhere with this other than to say I found the article very interesting and though provoking.  Food for thought?  <br/>

  Hi all -<br/>
<br/>
  With the arrival of the latest NCJSC newsletter, To-Ron, the first thing that caught my eye was an article written by Bob Haynes titled "The Conscience of the Collector." At first I was not sure where Bob was going with his article but reading it, I found it quite "thought provoking and wondered if others also found it so.<br/>
<br/>
  Basically, if I understand it correctly, the article points up the need for more serious kodogu study outside of Japan and the importance of thinking "outside the box"--traditional "Japanese thinking"--when it comes to sword study. <br/>
