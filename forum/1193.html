<h3>A little help please?</h3>
by <i>crankybeech</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-274142049">Hello all.<br/>
<br/>
I've been following the emails of this group for a while, and I must say<br/>
that I've truly enjoyed reading many of the messages that go out.  The<br/>
collective knowledge in this group is amazing.<br/>
<br/>
This leads me to my question.  Well, first a little background.  I'm<br/>
currently working on my MA in Art History at LSU.  My thesis work is on<br/>
cross-cultural currents of martial arts in the global community.  As a bit<br/>
of side research, I've been studying sword mounts, especially those of<br/>
Japanese origin.  I'm aware that the steel sword is introduced to Japan<br/>
from China sometime pre-Nara.  I'm also fairly up to speed on the<br/>
transformation of the sword from the Chinese design to one that is purely<br/>
Japanese.<br/>
<br/>
Now, what I'm trying to determine is if there is any evidence of the<br/>
Japanese style mounts ever being made in China (or SE Asia, Phillipines,<br/>
etc) prior to the modern age.  If any of you could point me in the right<br/>
direction, I'd be most grateful.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

No one has picked up the loose end you dangled in front of us, perhaps for<br/>
very good reason. I will do so, but only very carefully.  Before responding<br/>
to a part of the specific question you have put before the list, let me<br/>
make two general points.<br/>
First, I really like the idea of cross-cultural trends in martial arts - by<br/>
which I assume you mean the embellishment of weapons and associated<br/>
material objects as opposed to the behaviors of fighting.  This strikes me<br/>
as terribly interesting. I have always wondered about the distribution of<br/>
written messages on blades, for example. The worldwide occurrence of swords<br/>
with side blades, is another thing that somebody really ought to describe.<br/>
You are operating in a very interesting - and even significant - area.<br/>
Second, I think you will find that the wonder of Japanese swords is in the<br/>
details. You will have to be very careful about how you use and treat<br/>
Japanese data, or the grey beards of nippon-to will be very grumpy.<br/>
<br/>
Now on to your question.<br/>
<br/>
Over the past couple of years, I have gotten quite interested in tsuba that<br/>
seem - to me - to show direct influence between Japanese and foreign<br/>
swords. In generic terms these are assigned to the "Namban" style. Within<br/>
that categories there are masses of clearly Japanese stuff. Then there are<br/>
some guards that seem to have obvious referents to European rapiers or<br/>
smallsword guards. And then there are  guards that have been adapted for<br/>
use with Japanese blades altho they also seem to be of Chinese manufactures<br/>
These come in two type - at least. First there are some cupped tsuba that<br/>
seem to have been made in China and used in Japan. The other type is more<br/>
classically "Namban" but with no sign of accommodation to nippon-to. And<br/>
they show up in placed like Tibet and Nepal.<br/>
To my eye, these tsuba show diverse international influence that is not<br/>
surprising, given the way East Asia worked in the 16th and 17th century.<br/>
John Lissenden wrote a very interesting MA thesis on this school at the<br/>
University of Durham, last year. I am sure that he will try to see it<br/>
published, but that has not happened yet. Beyond that there is a lot of<br/>
other discussion of these issues whenever the Namban category is described.<br/>
<br/>
Best of luck<br/>

They seem to be able to furnish most any masters or doctorial<br/>
level work. I got two from them a couple years ago pertaining<br/>
to Japanese swords. There is of course charges involved for<br/>
copying and shipping.<br/>

I've been mulling this one over, too.  The only example I can think of that's a hard data point is a tsuba in the Boston Museum collection.  It's number 354 in the Ogawa catalog.  It is a piece that has nakago, kozuka and kogai ana that are typical of a guard made for a Japanese sword.  I don't see any evidence that it was made for another type of sword and modified for nihonto use.  Quoting from the catalog, this tsuba is signed:<br/>
<br/>
"Nan-ching yu -- Ch'ang Lo-chiao tsao K'ang-hsi (ting) - wei (sui) Ch'ang Lo-chiao tsao<br/>
<br/>
(Residing in Nanking, made by Ch'ang Lo-chiao.  Made in the [ting]-sheep [year] of K'ang-hsi [1667] by Ch'ang Lo-chiao)"<br/>
<br/>
It is not in one of the typical "Nanban" tsuba styles, but there is some of that taste to it in the overlapping foliage motif.  Can anyone discuss or dispute the reading of the signature?  Any comments on the guard?<br/>
<br/>
The text mentions another example signed with the same name.  I found one unsigned example with the same decorative motif and workmanship.<br/>
<br/>
I don't remember seeing any guards for Chinese swords with signatures.  Has anyone?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2112475789">Jim. that would be interesting, as at the start of the Kangxi period,<br/>
the whole of China was effectively still at war since the Qing were<br/>
taking over from the earlier Ming dynasty rulers. <br/>
 <br/>
When dating Chinese porcelain, we make use of a term called the<br/>
"Transitional Period" that lasts from 1620 - 1683 approx to indicate<br/>
that these pieces were made during a time of great turmoil, when the<br/>
imperial porcealain factories were not functioning (they had been<br/>
ransacked)............ however I digress.<br/>
 <br/>
We also know that hundreds of thousands of Japanese swords were exported<br/>
to the Chinese Court from the Kamakura period onwards into the 15th<br/>
century. However I have no literature stating that this continued into<br/>
the 17th cent, does anyone know anything about that ?<br/>
 <br/>
One can just imagine some metal worker in Nanking making a tsuba for his<br/>
Great Grandfathers treasured Japanese sword to take it to war once<br/>
again........ <br/>
 <br/>
I  might add it is extremely unusual for any Chinese artisan to sign<br/>
their work with the exception of perhaps paintings. <br/>
