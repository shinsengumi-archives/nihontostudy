<h3>Unknown seal ...</h3>
by <i>drjohnplissenden</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-611435625">Can anyone out there please identify the seal shown in my photo <br/>
album JPL?<br/>
<br/>
It is on an otherwise uninscribed tsuba of openwork iron, depicting <br/>
Chinan and the dragon within a slightly raised rim.   The carving is <br/>
of a very high quality, as is the skillful gold inlay.<br/>
<br/>
The presence of the hira-zogan gold seal, together with the image of <br/>
Chinan stirring up a storm is suggestive of Tetsugendo work, but I <br/>
believe that the brightness and sophistication of the image together <br/>
with the polished, brown surface of the metal exclude such a <br/>
provenance.<br/>
<br/>
I personally favour Okawa Teikan (Sadamoto) as the artist, but have <br/>
been unable to find this particular seal among the many that this <br/>
artist used.<br/>
<br/>
I am sorry about the poor quality of my first effort at posting <br/>
photographs, and will try again if they are felt to be inadequate.<br/>
<br/>
Regards, John L.</div>

<br/>
Thank you for your interest.  I think that I have finally mastered <br/>
the intricacies of GIF formats, and hope that the new seal <br/>
photograph is ok.<br/>
