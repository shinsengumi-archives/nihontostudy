<h3>Akao tsuba smith&#39;s and their work.</h3>
by <i>retalt</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-510349813">All, does anyone know if the Akao smith Yoshitsugu ( Shodai and Nidai ) <br/>
was the only smith of this group ( 9 generations I think ) that worked <br/>
in tetsu ?. I see the 1st and the 2nd Yoshitsugu worked in Shakudo <br/>
Sukashi after they moved to Edo, but worked in iron whilst in Echizen. <br/>
Did any of the other 7 Yoshitsugu's work in Iron, or were they all in <br/>
Shakudo and Shibuichi plate.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I see the Nidai signed ???? ( Akao Yoshitsugu if the kanji does <br/>
not come out ), did any other of the group sign this way ?.<br/>
<br/>

<h3>Han Bing Siong book now in stock</h3>
by <i>musashibobenkei</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-699977378">I am pleased to announce that "Japanese Swords in Dutch Collections," the<br/>
2003 publication of the late Mr. Han Bing Siong by the Netherlands Token<br/>
Society, is now in stock.<br/>
<br/>
Though I have over the years read and admired Mr. Han's articles in the<br/>
JSS/US Newsletter, English Token Bijitsu, and elsewhere, spending some time<br/>
with this book has overwhelmed me with the extent of his scholarship and the<br/>
magnitude of our loss with his recent passing. <br/>
<br/>
As the former owner of a katana signed (gimei, of course!) Hankei, I read<br/>
with interest the first entry in the book, a wakizashi by Hankei. I felt<br/>
like I learned more from that two pages than I had in all the reading I had<br/>
done back when I owned that blade and dug up every article, oshigata, and<br/>
reference to Hankei that I could find. <br/>
<br/>
This is the kind of book that makes me proud to be a bookseller.<br/>

85 blades of the 500 cataloged by Han Bing Song since 1979 was published to<br/>
celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Netherlands Token Society. The<br/>
cataloging project included swords in museums as well as private<br/>
collections. Of those presented in this book, a range of swords from Koto<br/>
through Gendaito are shown with oshigata and Mr. Han's scholarly and<br/>
insightful comments.  Seventeen of the blades are also presented in<br/>
photographs, and there are 14 pages of full color photographs of the best of<br/>
the koshirae. An outstanding publication of the highest quality and most<br/>

<br/>
The hitsu ana are of the Jingo style but not quite as elegant as Jingo work if you know what I mean.  The iron and plate do not seem to be Jingo to me from the photos.  I have one very similar that is signed. I will see if I can dig it up and send you a picture.<br/>

I don't have a lot of personal experience with Akao work, but my understanding is that the later generations did some work in iron, although not as much.  Also, while the first two generations started working in copper alloy after leaving Echizen, I don't think that they stopped making iron tsuba.  FWIW, I have an iron sukashi guard signed Kofu ju Akao Yoshitsugu.  This would probably be the third generation or later.  Your kanji for the nidai signature did not come out for me.  Sorting out generations from the signatures without personal names is not straightforward.  <br/>
