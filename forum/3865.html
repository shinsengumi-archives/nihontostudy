<h3>Tsuba opinion</h3>
by <i>sworddad</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2077026366">Hi Jim, all - <br/>
<br/>
I'm curious about this iron tsuba which I've placed in the photo album (Ron STL) named "sworddad." Iron sukashi measuring 79.3 mm, squared edge, motif of grape leaves/grapes with vines, backside shows back of blossoms, etc. Heavy gold applied to flowers. What seems odd (I've not seen this done before) is the use of wire to represent the "feelers" made intertwining with the thicker vines. <br/>
<br/>
All looks pretty Choshu to me but such a bold design, I wonder about Bizen Shoami, possibly. <br/>
<br/>
Opinions???<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1160849161">Hi Rod, I would have thought Choshu at first glance also. I have seen <br/>
these spiralled wires on several occasions recently, they are pretty <br/>
distinct work I think. I am assuming these are separate pieces of wire <br/>
that are twisted and inserted and welded or whatever in place. I will <br/>
look around and see if I can find these, thought I think they were <br/>
online and may well be gone by now.<br/>

I think it's most likely Bushu Ito, although Choshu is also possible.  I have seen wire work like that on Kyo Shoami a few times as well, but the carving and inlay style does not look like their work.  Unsigned Bizen Shoami can be tough to tell from Kyo Shoami, so it's possible, but it looks more Bushu/Choshu to me.  <br/>
<br/>
Some of the original Choshu designs can be bold and the early workmanship is good.  All of the rote repetition in the later work dilutes the image of the group.  I think that one of Nakai Zensuke Tomotsune's famous guards was in a grape vine motif.<br/>
<br/>
For what it's worth, I just flipped through Tsuba-Ko Bushu Ito Ha and found one example in shakudo with that sort of wire tendril work.  <br/>
