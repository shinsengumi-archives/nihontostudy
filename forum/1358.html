I've seen plenty worse, too.  For real, high quality Mino (or Goto) tsuba the color of the shakudo is pure black without a trace of brown.  The carving is very crisp and precise, the nanako perfectly formed and the gold thick with rich color.  Putting a good one next to a lesser one makes the difference much more clear than I can hope to describe.

Seeing this one in person would help of course, but I think it falls short.  The somewhat sloppy carving of the insects and plants looks like shiiremono work.  I agree that it is much better than the worst of the so-called Nagoya-mono.  That said, I have seen a few pieces of this type that I didn't think were too hot, but got Hozon level attribution to later Mino.  I suppose that there is overlap between the better Mino-style production work and lesser "genuine" Mino.  There is a chance that Milt's piece could paper as later Mino (even without free drinks) if it's better than the photo suggests.  I don't think that it is representative of high quality Mino work though.<br/>

visions of poor quality, mass production pieces.<br/>

I suspect (no proof) that these were actually cast bases<br/>
with hand finishing on the nanako and gold work. The nanako<br/>
is usually quite large and uneven; figural work is rounded<br/>
rather than sharply carved, gold/silver onlay commonly<br/>
"runs into" the nanako plate. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-647630483">Ah yes, another "to-do" article that never got off the ground! For years, I've found these Mino tsuba rather interesting and have accumulated a group of them of various qualities. My thinking was to put together an article comparing them to one another but I wouldn't hold my breath waiting for it! There is a small-ish book titled "Mino-bori" (I think thats the title) that shows a lot of the Mino work and dates the works. What I've always felt the book shows is how (almost?) "mass produced" so much of this work was. Interesting little book. Yamanaka translated it for me years ago. (It seems I gave that translation to somebody for editing and eventual publication, but if so, I don't recall who that was!) A lot of the brief text is pretty easy to understand, however. While not all such work can be called "excellent" I still find it interesting to study.<br/>

I suspect (again no proof) that much of what we see in fittings,<br/>
especially tsuba, are not "one ofs". I seen just too many of<br/>
the exact same design in too many tsuba. I suspect most of what<br/>
we see are "school" pieces and pattern book work; even for<br/>

and Kyo-Sukashi, etc. <br/>

I'm not real sure just where the line is between "original"<br/>

Archaeometallurgists spend a lot of time looking at etched cross sections taken from copper alloy artifacts to identify forged vs. cast, vs. hot worked cast, vs. cold worked cast, etc., from the details of the crystal structure.  It should be possible to get proof given an analyst and a piece to section. <br/>

  I suspect (no proof) that these were actually cast bases<br/>
  with hand finishing on the nanako and gold work. The nanako<br/>
  is usually quite large and uneven; figural work is rounded<br/>

Ko-Mino (i.e. pre Edo period Mino) does tend to be very deeply carved.  The walls of the carving are often very straight -- it's not a maru-bori style.  Ko-Mino work can have even deeper relief than your kashira, but not all do.  Thanks for putting your piece up.<br/>

"Kinko Mino Bori" by Kokubo Kenichi 1973, Token Shunjo Shinbunsha, Tokyo is a good reference.  The 1993 Kinko Mino Bori special exhibition catalog from the Gifu museum is even better.<br/>

They are typical Mino fuchi, but not very high quality.  The motif, the high relief carving, the bands at the top and bottom and the construction are all Mino.  They look like Edo period work.  There are some better examples of this type from the Edo period with Mino signatures.  I don't think that there's anything to do with Goto, though.  Valid examples of the Mino style.<br/>

I'm basing my guess that Nagoya-mono tsuba are cast plates<br/>

I think yours is Edo period.  So, just Mino.  Some Ko-Mino can be much more deeply carved than yours.  It's not really a deep marubori though.  The sides of the carving are very straight, without modeling.  The details of the motif will be carved with a relatively moderate amount of relief, but the background is carved way down so that the figures are standing up high.  It's sort of like a shadow box effect.  Not sure if that makes sense.  This can be hard to see in illustrations, since the depth isn't apparent in a straight-on photo.  The first time you see one of this type from the side it can be surprising.<br/>

Always good to see more Mino fittings.<br/>

Copper is a bit more dense than iron, and gold of course is more than twice as dense as copper.  But given the relatively small percentage of gold in even high quality shakudo, I doubt that it'd be practical to do kantei by weight.  <br/>
<br/>
I'm not sure how a copper alloy plate from Mino or decorated in Mino style would have a different weight from one of comparable size decorated somewhere else.  If anything, the deeply cut type of Mino-bori tsuba could tend to feel a little lighter than expected for its size due to the material removed.  <br/>

Yes, that's it -- thanks.  You can tell that there's some relief from the straight-on view, but not how high it really is until you get a view from the side. <br/>
<br/>
Also it's not just high relief, but very straight walled.  Goto Joshin also did pieces with high relief, but his carving style used that height for three dimensional modeling.  His volumes are large overall.  <br/>
