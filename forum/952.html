I had the same sort of intuition, but my understanding is that this was not exactly a precision therapeutic treatment.  It was more a matter of getting an exhausted horse to run a few more miles.  I think we'll need to find an Asian specialist in large animal veterinary with an interest in historical methods to make progress on this one.<br/>

I think it's a wee bit too big for acupunture.<br/>
OTOH, the novice acupunturist would not miss any  " energy points " <br/>
with a big needle like that...........<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1997237274">Hi Ken,  thanks for the site -- the description of the umabari with <br/>
the tool sold really privides a piece of the puzzle.<br/>
<br/>
And Jim Gilbert's observation that kogai and kozuka were mainly found <br/>
on the mountings for more treasured swords, which for the most part <br/>
are the ones that survived, makes sense.  My sayashi friend says it <br/>
would realy add the $$ if someone wanted him to make a saya with <br/>
carve outs for those tools.  <br/>
<br/>
Are there any examples of kogai or kozuka mounted on a tachi??  Any <br/>
idea when these tools first began to appear??  Trying to get a <br/>
complete picture of a 14th century samurai is tough.  Especially for <br/>
the lower samurai ranks, and the lowly ashigaru with their naginata, <br/>
yari, and uchikatanna.  Sure is fun though.<br/>
<br/>
as an aside, i also am glad Jim Kurrasch's site is still up.  Lots of <br/>
good stuff there.<br/>
<br/>
thanks for the help with my minor mystery, guys.<br/>
