I don't think there are different forms... it's a short section of "unsharpened" edge just above the hamachi.  It's not unusual with gendaito, but is rather rare in older blades.  It is ground away as the blade is polished over time.<br/>
<br/>
Very old and very good saiha swords that are otherwise intact can sometimes get kanteisho.  <br/>
<br/>
Hopefully someone more knowledgeable about swords can comment.<br/>

I think the definition you have provided is more likely what Cary and the gang were talking about, though obviously odd in the case of such an old sword.  Thanks for the information.  <br/>

I was the guy who tossed out ububa at the Kenkyukai, nice to meet you <br/>
BTW, however I was highly mistaken in my kantei. Cary explained that <br/>
this "ububa" was the result of Fujishiro Sensei restoring the hamachi <br/>
as part of the overall polish and restoration. When we normally see <br/>
this it is on new blades, often on Shinshinto...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1251565183">Re retempered blades getting papers, there is at least one Juyo saiba blade,<br/>
it is signed 'Chikamura Tatematsuru', its existence proved that the famous<br/>
Sanjo Munechika blade signed 'Munechika Murakami' was made by his pupil<br/>
Chikamura and had the 'mune' added later. 'kami' and 'tatematsuru' being the<br/>
same kanji.<br/>
