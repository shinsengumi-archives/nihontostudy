<h3>Japanese Swords, Weaponry & Dai-Token-Ichi Tour</h3>

<br/>
For anyone who is serious about appreciating and studying Japanese swords, <br/>
fittings and weaponry, going to Japan and visiting some of the finest <br/>
museums, castles, sword stores and the annual Dai-Token-Ichi are an absolute <br/>
MUST. Attached is the itinerary for the upcoming tour from October 16th to <br/>
October 27th.  It is only 5 months from now so now is a good time to do some <br/>
advance planning. All things considered, the cost of the trip is a modest <br/>
investment as you will learn, see and experience so much. If you confine <br/>
yourselves to sword shows and museums in the USA, you will NEVER advance <br/>
your knowledge. I organize and conduct the one and only comprehensive and <br/>
focused Japanese swords, fittings and weaponry tour.<br/>
Thanks for reading,<br/>
<br/>
