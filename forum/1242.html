<h3>Nie-no-kui-sagari</h3>
by <i>sworddad</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1063185368">Hi all - <br/>
<br/>
The latest Token Bijutsu journal (NBTHK) shows a wonderful tanto by Awataguchi Yoshimitsu (late Kamakura), illustrated on the fold-out page. The boshi of this tanto shows (as described), "...the boshi is sugu then turns back in ko-maru with hakikake then nie-no-kui-sagari (descending nie line)...) Personally, I've never noticed this odd characteristic on any illustrated swords before although it seems "somebody" recently asked me about this kind of thing.<br/>
<br/>
For those of you who do not have this journal, picture the boshi as described and at the end of the rather extended kaeri, there is a short "wisp" of nie that comes down off the end of the kaeri at about a 45 degree angle, into the ji. Interesting odd nie formation! Can anyone elaborate on this characteristic, if it is unique to Yoshimitsu or perhaps Awataguchi blades in general, whatever??? Comments?<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
In the recent book of the Masamune exhibition on page twelve there is an <br/>
oshigata of an Awataguchi Kunitsuna tachi which appears to show<br/>
a similar feature.<br/>
