<h3>A nice Waki in Argentina</h3>
by <i>laborumdoctor</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-917747163">Hi Group<br/>
Can you help me with this waki?<br/>
Many people told me that it is 1661, but another one who told me that <br/>
it was much more modern.<br/>
According to the marks on the nakago, we will know about it when? <br/>
<br/>
Another question: <br/>
It's about the second mekugi ana ... <br/>
It will be a shortened Katana? And signed again in the nakago? <br/>
Thank you and excuse my mishandling of the English language <br/>
Regards<br/>
Eduardo<br/>

<br/>
There are three Shinto listings for Sadasuke. One of them used Minamoto in his <br/>
signature, and generally, based on your photos, I suspect this is the work of <br/>
Shimada Sadasuke of circa Kanbun or 1661. It is a very nice looking piece.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-610821649">Dear Eduardo,<br/>
<br/>
This is an exquisitely beautiful wakizashi of quality.  Blade signed with three characters MINAMOTO SADASUKE.  There are SADASUKE listed as working in both Koto and Shinto period in different areas of Japan:<br/>
<br/>
Shimada school Koto: <br/>
Suruga province, 1501 1st generation<br/>
      "          "        1558 2nd generatiom<br/>
Shimada school Shinto:<br/>
Suruga province, 1624 1st generation<br/>
      "          "        1661-1684 2nd generation<br/>
Sadahiro school Koto:<br/>
Soshu province, 1469-89 (may not be Sadahiro school)<br/>
    "            "       1542 1st generation<br/>
    "            "       1573 2nd generation<br/>
<br/>
Then there are the "orphans":<br/>
Sadasuke, Owari 1688 (2 character signature)<br/>
Sadasuke, Iwashiro 1688.<br/>
<br/>
(Above information is from Willis Hawley's Big Brown Book)<br/>
<br/>
So, Eduardo, as Peter Bleed and John Stuart have commented, it is very good looking sword with no comparable oshigata "in the books".  From looking at your pictures to me the sword reeks of quality.  Peter has noted the tsuba.  I particularly note the habaki and seppa as being of exceptional workmanship, being gold foil over (I'm guessing) copper.  The habaki is just beautiful and of the niju type (two pieces).  The best part Eduardo is the condition - this wakizashi is a beautiful collector's piece.  Oh, the tang is very original with the two holes.  I'm sure the second hole near the tip of the tang is original, if unusual in a wakizashi - it's more usually seen in meatier katana.<br/>
<br/>
I've just catalogued 62 Japanese swords for an auction, many of them wakizashi, and NONE were in the condition that "your" sword is.  None!!  This is a sword to be proud of and I'm sure the smith is in a book somewhere.  I'll check in a set that a friend has and report back.<br/>
<br/>
Best regards<br/>

<br/>
PS - I see Gordon has identified your blade.  Congrats again.<br/>

Thanks for the heads up. I had not thought to check Fujishiro's. I also disagree. If <br/>
you separate out just the three characters from the longer inscription in Fujishiro's, <br/>
you will see that these characters are very close. I think this is his man. Shimada <br/>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-753317341">Hi Maximo;<br/>
<br/>
You have posed a difficult problem with no clear answer.  <br/>
This however is quite normal when dealing with Japanese swords, there never seems to be a simple answer.<br/>
<br/>
There were a number of Mihara smiths who were named Masaie and signed Masaie.<br/>
<br/>
The Mihara were divided onto two groups based on their work styles and the period they worked,<br/>
<br/>
In the Ko Mihara of the Kamakura period, circa 1300, the founder of the Mihara school was named Masaie.<br/>
<br/>
The work style of the Ko Mihara was koshi sori, with high and wide shinogi, and iori mune. <br/>
They made mostly tachi and tanto with a few shoto. <br/>
The hada I have seen are a tight ko-itame and the color of the ji is fairly dark<br/>
and there is ji nie and there is utsuri present.  The hamon is mostly a narrow suguha, the nioi is wide and deep. and there is ashi and sometimes yo.  <br/>
The boshi is ko maru or o maru on a small kissaki.  The nakago is ha agiri kurijiri.  <br/>
The mei is usually cut in the center of the nakago, cut with a fine chisel but the kanji are large and deep cut.<br/>
<br/>
The Sue Mihara worked in the Muromachi period from the end of the Nambokucho period. <br/>
They made mostly katana, wakizashi and tanto.  <br/>
The quality of their work was not of the standard of the earlier generations and was inferior. <br/>
They made mostly shinogi zukiri blades and the style and shape of the blades was similar to the Ko Mihara, but not as elegant or well proportioned.  <br/>
They tempered in a suguha as did the earlier smiths but it is wider and also a gunome midare.  <br/>
Quite often there is usually utsuri present and blades with very little or no activity in the ha are the most common.  <br/>
The mei is cut smaller and not as deep as the earlier generations. and are cut closer to the mune, and the mei are longer.<br/>
<br/>
In general the older blades are more elegant and better proportioned and the ji is much darker.<br/>
<br/>
I hope this helps a little.<br/>
<br/>
John<br/>

Hi Maximo;<br/>
<br/>
You have posed a difficult problem with no clear answer. <br/>
This however is quite normal when dealing with Japanese swords, there never<br/>
seems to be a simple answer.<br/>
<br/>
There were a number of Mihara smiths who were named Masaie and signed<br/>
Masaie.<br/>
<br/>
The Mihara were divided onto two groups based on their work styles and the<br/>
period they worked,<br/>
<br/>
In the Ko Mihara of the Kamakura period, circa 1300, the founder of the<br/>
Mihara school was named Masaie.<br/>
<br/>
The work style of the Ko Mihara was koshi sori, with high and wide shinogi,<br/>
and iori mune. <br/>
They made mostly tachi and tanto with a few shoto. <br/>
The hada I have seen are a tight ko-itame and the color of the ji is fairly<br/>
dark<br/>
and there is ji nie and there is utsuri present. The hamon is mostly a<br/>
narrow suguha, the nioi is wide and deep. and there is ashi and sometimes<br/>
yo. <br/>
The boshi is ko maru or o maru on a small kissaki. The nakago is ha agiri<br/>
kurijiri. <br/>
The mei is usually cut in the center of the nakago, cut with a fine chisel<br/>
but the kanji are large and deep cut.<br/>
<br/>
The Sue Mihara worked in the Muromachi period from the end of the Nambokucho<br/>
period. <br/>
They made mostly katana, wakizashi and tanto. <br/>
The quality of their work was not of the standard of the earlier generations<br/>
and was inferior. <br/>
They made mostly shinogi zukiri blades and the style and shape of the blades<br/>
was similar to the Ko Mihara, but not as elegant or well proportioned. <br/>
They tempered in a suguha as did the earlier smiths but it is wider and also<br/>
a gunome midare. <br/>
Quite often there is usually utsuri present and blades with very little or<br/>
no activity in the ha are the most common. <br/>
The mei is cut smaller and not as deep as the earlier generations. and are<br/>
cut closer to the mune, and the mei are longer.<br/>
<br/>
In general the older blades are more elegant and better proportioned and the<br/>
ji is much darker.<br/>
<br/>
I hope this helps a little.<br/>
<br/>

My daughter sent me this link. I thought it might be of some interest. I<br/>
