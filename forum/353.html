<h3>been a little quite</h3>
by <i>retalt</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1427501291">Greetings all, I thought I would run this by the group since its been a<br/>
bit ( read lot ) quite out there. A mate and I were talkin swod tok the<br/>
other night and we were discussing tanto. He mentioned and sent pics of<br/>
a very small blade that measures app 22cm in total length. As it turns<br/>
out, I have one almost identical in size. Mine, as is his is also quite<br/>
thick, both about 7 or 8 mm at the munemachi, very much like a<br/>
yorio-doshi only far too short.<br/>
<br/>
Paul mentioned that he was told his was made as a gift for the wife of a<br/>
samurai as a wedding present. He believes his to be mid/late edo and<br/>
traditionally made. MIne is out of polish and hard to see hada or hamon,<br/>
nie, nioi etc.. but the rest of it looks pretty similar.<br/>
<br/>
here is a link to the two tanto Tantos <www.whiz.com.au/richard/tantos.jpg><br/>
<br/>
I believe blades were common gifts for samurai wife's and I would expect<br/>
them to be smaller than usual but 22 cm is pretty small and more like a<br/>
child's size, though I guess weilded properly, could inflict just as<br/>
much damage as a 30cm tanto.<br/>
<br/>
looking forward to all opinions.<br/>
<br/>
cheers<br/>

	Probably talking outta my hat as usual but I think we should <br/>
remember that these were small people, who needed to carry a variety <br/>

Thanks for the compliment on the sword!<br/>
<br/>
I should have brought it to NY (NTHK shinsa) last year. (I had tsuba <br/>
submitted because I didn't know I was actually going to make it <br/>
until the last minute)<br/>
<br/>
It is interesting the way they used the leather as a spring. The <br/>
lock still works well. Nice simple design.<br/>
<br/>
I think if I was starting in nihonto all over again I would <br/>
specialize in tanto...so many wonderful examples of blades/koshirae.<br/>

Koshirae with that kind of spring clip are usually (maybe always) fitted with a ring rather than a traditional kurikata.  I don't know what the difference in use was, but there probably was a practical reason.  I don't have a firm understanding of toppei koshirae, but at least some of these examples with the external spring clip were apparently made for wear with Western-style clothing.  Some toppei koshirae without a spring clip still have a ring-swivel fitting instead of a kurikata.  Others have a fixed or swivel ring mounted on the "edge" rather than the side of the saya.  I think that the sageo used was more like a string rather than a flat braid.  I suspect that they were worn at a different angle to the body and possibly there was a greater risk of the sword falling out of the saya, hence the clip.  I don't know much about them.  Tom, any ideas?<br/>
<br/>
Etched soft metal isn't a very common technique.  Good lacquer and an interesting wrap, too.  It would fit right in the Edo no Tanto Koshirae picture book.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-543084663">Jim et al-<br/>
	While I dig this style of Koshirae very much, I can't say I <br/>
know all I would like to about them. Toppei I believe refers to the <br/>
shape of the kashira and kojiri IE; tapering. I agree with all that <br/>
Jim has said, I believe these were popular at the tail end of the Edo <br/>
period when Western weapons and tactics were being fervently studied <br/>
by the Japanese.<br/>
	This style of koshirae could be used with hakama or European <br/>
trousers, hence the swivel often seen. The swivelling "kurikata" <br/>
allowed the sword to be thrust thru the Obi or slung "backward" in <br/>
western fashion when dressed in pants.<br/>
	The gunto koshirae is an extension of this idea and one can <br/>
see how many different ways were invented to allow quick conversion <br/>
from saber to uchigatana...<br/>
	More often than not these are of superior workmanship. My <br/>
belief is that the new officers of the newly formed rifle or <br/>
artillery units went for this style and most of them with the money <br/>
to get a special set up like this were likely sons of the Bakufu. <br/>
There is one memorable example of this style which is decidedly <br/>
common, showing rough simple work suitable more for a foot soldier <br/>
than an officer; That would be Saigo Takamoris' shuzaya toppei <br/>
goshirae which carried a gimei Muramasa blade.<br/>
	I think this little tanto exhibits all the features of a <br/>
quality koshirae in this style. There is one more feature not yet <br/>
mentioned and that is that Toppei koshirae typically feature iron <br/>
fittings with silver inlay (sometimes gold).<br/>
	That really is all I know (or have been taught). Thirsting for more,<br/>

<h3>Re: [nihontostudy] Re: been a little quite</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-221771859">and while I'm on a roll, we all enjoyed Ron's excellent tanto koshirae <br/>
when we were discussing the small tanto last week, but I am unsure if I <br/>
saw an answer to my original question.<br/>
<br/>
Were these very little blades common in any particular period. It was <br/>
suggested that they may have been made for women's wedding presents or <br/>
some such thing, and I think it was suggested that blades offered to <br/>
women as presents was a Meiji or there abouts practice.<br/>
<br/>
I would have thought a small blade would be easy to conceal and <br/>
therefore perfect for any clandestin action. I am wondering if these <br/>
very small blades ( 15 cm or there abouts ) were common to any <br/>
particular era. I wouldn't have thought they would be useful as <br/>
yorio-doshi as they would be too short, though they all seem to be quite <br/>
wide so I thought they may have not been Koto. So I guess that leaves <br/>
Shinto and on.<br/>
<br/>
Any thoughts on this.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers all<br/>

<h3>Question about a Book</h3>
by <i>gentleman9</i>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-406092738">Guys & Gals,<br/>
<br/>
Got a question for you all. I just picked up a book<br/>
today "Tanto" by SUZUKI Yoshisada. I am curious as to<br/>
if these books were signed by the author. Do any of<br/>
you have this book and does the inside cover look<br/>
anything like the image below? If not can any of you<br/>
read what is written on the inside cover of this one?<br/>
Thanks for your help. <br/>
