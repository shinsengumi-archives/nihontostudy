<div id="ygrps-yiv-629090804">Hello All,<br/>
<br/>
Appologies in advance for the remedial nature of my question(s), since this is old hat to many of you.  I have recently acquired a sword that seems worthy and interesting enough to warrant a Japanese polish, a saya/habaki and submission for papers.  Despite I have seen the details of this process a few times on this list, I don't remember everything, and I certainly don't know the chronology of events and their respective costs (approximate) and the amount of time involved.<br/>
<br/>
Could someone tell me (again) the steps involved in sending a sword to Japan, having it polished, having a new habaki and shirasaya made and submitting it for papers?  I am particularly sketchy and forgetful with regard to the use of agents, how to navigate the blade through customs, making sure it gets to who it needs to get to, etc.  Also, I haven't a clue as to how much this will all cost, nor how long it takes.  Any help is appreciated.  Thank you.<br/>
<br/>
Best Regards,<br/>

There are a few guys who can act as agents, and I will leave it up to<br/>
the forum to recommend a few as I don't have personal dealings with<br/>
any of them yet.<br/>

 <br/>
  The best thing is to do the entire process through a dealer with whom you have a longstanding relationship.  We have several of these guys on either list.  They should also be able to estimate for you how long the process will take.  Bob Benson, in Hawaii, is also a reliable source on this.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
