<h3>Satsuma Rebellion mountings</h3>
by <i>Peter A Bleed</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-157391160">Dear Friends,<br/>
      Please let me ask a question about a style of koshirae, even if I<br/>
suspects that it  falls well below the standards of most those on this<br/>
list.<br/>
      I am suddenly, and I hopefully briefly, interested in so-called<br/>
"Satsuma rebellion" fittings. I recall seeing these over the years, but<br/>
never had a term for them until Fuller and Gregory published a couple of<br/>
pages about them in their first volume on "Imperial swords." In that book,<br/>
they say - without reference - that the samurai army raised  against the<br/>
newly formed Imperial Army  of the Meiji government  by Saigo Takamori was<br/>
equipped with swords that have a distinctive flat wrap and very ordinary<br/>
kodogu. Notably, they often have simple washer style menuki.<br/>
      There is no question that these fittings are a "type" that does occur<br/>
in the real world. By that I mean that it is a fairly consistent style that<br/>
we do see it from time to time. It looks expedient and very<br/>
"utility-grade." But is anyone really aware of evidence that they really<br/>
were associated with the Satsuma Rebellion? I'm wondering if they might<br/>
simply be very low-end koshirae produced in terminal Edo/Meiji times for<br/>
any market there was for low-end swords. If any one has insights on this, I<br/>
would appreciate them. Thnak you<br/>
      I might as well explain why I ask. I recently acquired some (about<br/>
140 in all ) 1910 vintage photos of North Pacific ethnographic objects that<br/>
were being sold by a dealer. A couple of these pictures show Japanese<br/>
swords and at least one of them certainly looks like a "Rebellion sword." I<br/>
know the Rebellion failed, but I have a hard time believing that Saigo left<br/>
Kyushu for the Aleutians!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>By no means, Pete, an interesting subject. It would be so interesting to see perhaps a dozen or two examples of this kind of mountings pulled together into a well illustrated article and some research by which to draw some conclusions. Too often these "original" era mountings are pulled apart because they are so utilitarian when in reality, they are examples "of the era" that should be preserved. I have one such mounting at this time and do plan on preserving it intact. <br/>

As an aside...did you get my email about the arrowhead menuki that I sent a few days ago???<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-226291428">Peter,<br/>
Given the uniformity of that style of koshirae I'd suspect that they were assembled in a fairly narrow space of time and place rather than being a general style of late, low quality mount.  They give the impression of being made for imminent use rather than routine daily wear.  The Satsuma rebellion label seems plausible, but I don't know of any hard evidence supporting F&G's attribution.  For what it's worth, the book published last year on Satsuma koshirae does not include any illustrations of this type of mount.<br/>
<br/>
On the subject of your photos, I've seen a lot of references to George I. Quimby's 1985 paper "Japanese Wrecks, Iron Tools, and Prehistoric Indians of the Northwest Coast" published in Arctic Anthropology 22(2):7-15.  I haven't read it, but it might be of interest.<br/>
<br/>
Here is a link to an interesting on-line article from the Royal British Columbian Museum web site that disputes Quimby but does cite intentional and unintentional travel by pre-20th C Japanese to the western coast of the Americas:<br/>

I don't think that there is any connection with the Ito school.  Bushu is of course the other name for Musashi province, where Edo/Tokyo is located.  There were many fitting makers living in Bushu.<br/>
<br/>
Given the variation in the Kunihiro signatures and the quality of the work there may have been more than one person making those tsuba.  Haynes proposes 4 or 5 makers working over the course of 100 years in his Index of Japanese Sword Fittings and Associated Artists. <br/>

I'm not sure I got back to you about the Satsuma Rebellion comments. They<br/>
were interesting and insightful as usual. Thanks.<br/>

Thanks for the image of the Satsuma Rebellion sword. Is this you sword? And<br/>
are there any other images. I am not sure I want to get too seriously<br/>
involved in this project, but those darn Japanese swords, they sure do<br/>
present a lot of interesting topics for consideration!<br/>
