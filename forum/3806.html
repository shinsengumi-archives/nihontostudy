<div id="ygrps-yiv-283277194">All,<br/>
Sorry for the OT post, but has anyone here actually been caught by the<br/>
fraudster Pawel Nowak in Poland?<br/>
I know a lot of you have been contacted, but looking for anyone who<br/>
lost money to him.<br/>
Am working on making his life a bit inconvenient.<br/>
Need a few confirmed victims. He offers Japanese Swords at a good<br/>
price with info, pics, id and other details, and never sends anything.<br/>
Been doing this for years. (No..I wasn't caught)<br/>
Please contact me at Sigp210(at)yahoo.com. Just need a name, email and<br/>
confirmation of being scammed.</div>
