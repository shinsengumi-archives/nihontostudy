The Southeast Japanese Sword Show and Auction is fast upon us. In this message we are reaching out to many others who may not have had first hand information about our show. So we would encourage everyone to view our website for complete details at SoutheastJapaneseSwordShowAuction.com.  Our auction is also fully posted both on our website and at liveauctioneers.com. If you can't make the show in person, please, peruse our auction catalog and consider bidding online or by our absentee bid form. We will also take a limited number of orders for physical catalogs. Please call or e-mail for details. Our catalog lists wonderful items in every price range.<br/>
Our show magazine which is free with admission can also be purchased for $10 postage paid.<br/>
<br/>
Best Wishes to Everyone.<br/>
Hope to see you at the show.<br/>
