<h3>Sukeyoshi</h3>
by <i>elliottshogun</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1192676845">I was reading Alan and Richards discussion about Edo Tosho Tsuba being <br/>
made by swordsmiths/armor makers. I learned (at the SF Token Kai)from <br/>
Robert Haynes that a tsuba I had (I could not read the signature)was <br/>
made by Sukeyoshi. It is signed Sukeyoshi Saku. Robert told me he was <br/>
a swordsmith who made tsuba and signed his 'Suke' differently than his <br/>
swords. <br/>

Where can I read more about Sukeyoshi? Do you have any knowledge of <br/>
this smith?<br/>

There were many Sukeyoshi smiths, if you want to know more then we need to know which kanji were used.<br/>

Robert Haynes showed me (by drawing out on paper)the different kanji <br/>
for 'Suke' that this smith used. It's very hard to see on the tsuba. <br/>
I will attempt a better photo. This description may help; the legs <br/>
of the kanji (suke) are spread apart at the top (like a vee). I have <br/>
the little post-it that Robert drew the kanji on. <br/>
<br/>
Let me work on this. I appreciate your help.<br/>

I just remembered something else about Sukeyoshi - His teacher was <br/>
Masatsugu. Sukeyoshi worked in Bingo during Kei-o (1865). This is <br/>
everything I have researched to date.<br/>
<br/>
Hope you can give me more. Thanks, <br/>

	That would be Yokoyama Sukeyoshi, who worked in Bizen and Fukuyama  <br/>
Bingo on the cusp of the Modern era. His dated works are from Keio  <br/>
(1865) and Meiji(1868). Sounds like a very cool tsuba, can't wait to  <br/>
see the pictures. I have to admit, like Richard, I enjoy those late  <br/>
Edo swordsmiths tsuba. I just bought a papered 11th generation  <br/>
Yasutsugu tsuba at last weekends Taikai.<br/>
	Addressing Richards question, the Yasutsugu tsuba I have seen are  <br/>
rather plain, while Masahide seems to have put a lot of work into his  <br/>
tsuba. Pure speculation but I would think he would have presented the  <br/>
tsuba as a separate independant work. Who would want all that work  <br/>
overshadowed by  a blade or vice versa. I base it solely on my ill- <br/>
informed ideas of what a craftsman like Masahide was all about.<br/>
FWIW<br/>

	Sorry, should have included that you'll find more info in Token to  <br/>
Rekishi, Token Bijutsu and Token Kaishi where various articles have  <br/>
appeared. Since these are Japanese references and I am sorry I do not  <br/>
have the pertinent numbers at hand, I would look for 'Art and The  <br/>
Sword'. The publication of the JSSUS, I believe they did one issue on  <br/>
Yokoyama Bizen...<br/>

There is nothing on Sukeyoshi in the English edition of Token Bijutsu, you might have some problems researching him as he was a pretty minor smith.<br/>
