<h3>Sotheby auction</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-775393458">Hi all - <br/>
<br/>
Not having the catalogue for Alan Harvie's tsuba (Sotheby's auction just ended), I'm curious if lot 706 was a single tsuba or was that for multiple tsuba. It appears to be a single, ex-Compton Kamakura-bori tsuba but further down (on the internet listing) it mentions "quantity 2" which puzzles me. Pretty healthy price for a tsuba, if indeed one tsuba. If so, would you say "provenance" played a big roll in achieving this price?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1597383615">The two in parenthesis does mean there are two items: the tsuba and the the tsuba box bearing a hakogaki by Torigoye.  <br/>
<br/>
The 4560 pounds + 20 % buyer's premium of 912 = 5472 x 1.752 conversion rate to dollars = 8760 more or less, but probably a little more.   But it is a famous piece, one we all recognize from the book. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1796213116">Actually the prices on the results sheet include the 20% buyer's<br/>
premium, so this was even more of a 'bargain' at $7,989!<br/>
<br/>
The catalog is a great reference, and I'll have it in stock in a<br/>
couple of weeks, and will have copies for sale at the San Francisco<br/>
Token Kai.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-737157097">Hi.<br/>
 The number notations, curiously enough, include tsuba and their signed<br/>
boxes if any. The irony was that things with a "Compton" name tended to<br/>
do well, where as it is the "Harvie" name that ought to have been the<br/>
clue to value after value. <br/>
