<h3>San Francisco Token Taikai</h3>
by <i>soshuju</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-515766989">Gentle-readers and poor souls,<br/>
	I say poor souls because I know how pitiable one feels when <br/>
he cannot get to the show. This was my first show in like five years <br/>
and I enjoyed every minute. From Thursday night check in to last <br/>
minute haggle on Sunday.<br/>
	From this list I met Curran, Darcy and Rick for the first <br/>
time, and I became reacquainted with others like Ron Hartman etc...I <br/>
knew and remembered most everyone there, so spent a great many <br/>
pleasant hours just getting caught up. In the past I was just the new <br/>
kid or one more face in the crowd. Now that they had all seen my face <br/>
"in the paper" as it were I met many more people who expressed <br/>
interest in my articles. Frankly it was very nice to know that <br/>
someone had been reading them, and very kind of everyone to pay the <br/>
compliments.<br/>
	I try to be scientific in my approach to the showroom but <br/>
depending on who I run into it doesn't always work. On Thursday I <br/>
covered the whole room as best I could returning to my table (really <br/>
a friends table), with two t-shirts, 9 DVDs and a mental list of <br/>
tables and people I would need to revisit.<br/>
	As Dr. Gordon Robson DRE, and Okada Moriyoshi of the NTHK <br/>
were in attendance, I naturally did my best to make the distinguished <br/>
guests from Japan feel at home. Along with Jim Gilbert we had a fine <br/>
seafood dinner and shared talk of swords, kodogu, the London Shinsa <br/>
and the possibility of a SFO Shinsa in the future.<br/>
	Friday opened early with more of the same, I put some books <br/>
out which sold quickly and thus had some coin to spend on the items <br/>
on my want list. Replacing books with books is always a danger with <br/>
me, I spotted a title I had been after and made note of price and <br/>
location. There were some supplies I needed and priced those at <br/>
several tables, while just perusing other things.<br/>
	There wasn't much armour to be seen but quite a few good <br/>
swords. Especially right across the front of the room. Cary Condell, <br/>
Michael Krause, Ralph Bell and Fred Weisberg, Al Bardi, Robert Hughes <br/>
and Mark Robinson all had fine blades in polish and ready to move. <br/>
Michael Krause and Robert Hughes had good blades in nice koshirae, <br/>
Ralph and Fred mostly blades in shirasaya. Cary had a monster blade <br/>
at sanshaku in koshirae and a selection of fine kodogu. As promised <br/>
he showed me his Sa Yukihide Tanto, which rather than elicit "wows!" <br/>
gave me to utter a contented "MMM Good..." It looked and felt solid <br/>
in every respect.<br/>
	Friday I was busy helping set up and monitor the lecture and <br/>
kansho-kai presented by the NTHK and Dr. Robson. The topic was <br/>
Bizen-den from Muromachi to Shishinto, with Sue-koto Bizen blades <br/>
most in evidence. The arc from Late nambokucho to bakumatsu was <br/>
illustrated clearly by the shapes and workmanship in each. As <br/>
mentioned the Kozori tachi was a rare treasure in any company, I <br/>
liked the Kiyomitsu ken as well. I was impressed that proper sword <br/>
etiquette was strictly followed by all, though for the life of me <br/>
cannot imagine what it was that kept people in line.<br/>
	Afterwards back in the showroom the tables had almost filled <br/>
up, excepting those dealers from the East Coast who got caught in the <br/>
Blackout. While there were plenty of polished/papered blades <br/>
available there seemed to be a distinct lack of piles of junk. There <br/>
really weren't any tables stacked with rusty, chipped and broken <br/>
diamonds in the rough, waiting to be spotted by a discerning eye. <br/>
This might be explained by the abscence of Mr. Wahlberg, but it seems <br/>
that most everyone had just a few choice items to sell. Perhaps the <br/>
object was to travel light.<br/>
	Friday ended like each night ended with groups of like minded <br/>
enthusiasts huddled around a warm Sam Adams, discussing the virtues <br/>
of a Kunimichi katana or the foible of seeing all Shinto works with <br/>
mitsumune as Hankei blades.<br/>
	Saturday skipped breakfast and an initial foray into the <br/>
showroom to get in line at the Masamune Jutetsu exhibition. Avoiding <br/>
the long line opposite the Masamune, I jumped into the middle of the <br/>
table and found myself addressing a Naotsuna katana and then a Sa <br/>
Hiroyasu, then Okanemitsu, then Naoe Shizu, then Yamato Shizu <br/>
Kaneuji. At this point in Japan we would likely be done but there <br/>
were thirteen or more blades, all textbook examples of the artist. <br/>
Better education for the eye cannot be found, I'm thinking. That <br/>
Masamune was so popular that it was the one blade I didn't get to <br/>
see, by all accounts it or the first Norishige was the best blade on <br/>
the table. For me the Norishige was the best blade I saw all weekend.<br/>
	Back up on the sales floor, more books and supplies. Made the <br/>
rounds with some iai friends looking for acquisitions. There was no <br/>
auction but we did have a special presentation at dinner. As part of <br/>
the preparation for the show we polled local politicians for letters <br/>
of support. We received letters from many club members, the Consulate <br/>
General of Japan, the Mayor of Burlingame and the Mayor of San <br/>
Francisco. In an only in San Francisco twist, it seems the office of <br/>
Mayor Willie Brown misunderstood just exactly what we were after. <br/>
Instead of a letter of support we received something better! A <br/>
proclamation from the Mayor making Saturday August 16th DR.GORDON <br/>
ROBSON DAY!! Our very own holiday celebrated with a pair of <br/>
suspenders, a pint of beer and a good cigar.<br/>
	Sunday, with tables closing down here and there the last <br/>
minute wheeling and dealing began. I got a deal on some good books I <br/>
had been eyeing all weekend, and bought a tanto just because the <br/>
koshirae caught my fancy. Hataya Sensei was there along with Ando <br/>
San. While Hataya didn't seem to leave with but a small armful, Ando <br/>
san had to buy an extra guncase at the end to carry his purchases.<br/>
	BTW I met the Ebay Monk he paid his daughter to wear kimono <br/>
and man his table. She generated a good deal of interest but it seems <br/>
he sold nothing. He may be reading this list because he brought <br/>
several daisho sets, and asked me "aren't daisho popular with <br/>
Americans?"<br/>
	As always there were lots of things I wish I had the coin to <br/>
purchase and too many people I wish I had more time to sit down and <br/>
chat with. Overall the rumblings were that prices were high and sales <br/>
were slow but it was a successful show. If you are reading this and <br/>
not remembering it, then start making your plans for next year, these <br/>
shows are only getting better year after year.<br/>
