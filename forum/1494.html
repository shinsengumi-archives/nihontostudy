Yujo refers to Goto Yujo, the first generation.  I hadn't noticed the term Yujo yasuri before, although as I mentioned in an earlier post he does seem to be the first one applying fine sujigai yasuri to gold kogai, at least as far as surviving and published examples go.<br/>
<br/>
Checking Kajihara's glossary again, the terms Yujo-yasuri habaki and koshi-Yujo habaki are listed in the habaki section on page 146.  There is no drawing for a Yujo-yasuri habaki, just some text.  There is a drawing of a koshi-Yujo habaki, which looks like the ones you pointed out.  Both sources are saying that the fine filework on the lower half are the Yujo-yasuri.  I think that the work on the upper part is what is usually referred to as cat scratch.  Although Kajihara describes the term nekogaki, he doesn't provide an illustration.   <br/>
<br/>
I have never seen file work by Yujo or other Goto makers that had the raised and burnished burs that appear on these habaki.  Their file marks are fine and smooth.  Probably a somewhat different tool and/or technique.  This work with the raised bumps is quite typical of habaki, but I have seen it on the backs of some machibori kodogu.<br/>
<br/>
Oddly the text in Kajihara about Yujo yasuri habaki does not appear in the English translation volume.  It says something like that this is a kind of ji-yasuri habaki that is called Yujo-yasuri because it is like the style of yasuri particular to Yujo.  The koshi-Yujo habaki is based on this. <br/>

I haven't had time to check this myself but I wonder if that massive book on Goto (with fold-outs), title escapes me at the moment, might show some habaki that are attributed to any of the Goto. I'll have to take a look later this weekend. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, not so much lore, but "just another thought".  One of the great things I<br/>
have admired in Nihonto is that even the apparently decorative always has a<br/>
practical purpose.  The taper on a habaki performs the same function in the saya<br/>
as does the taper on a car's rear axle and hub.  It "locks", requiring some<br/>
force to break the "union" of the two parts.  The "cat scratches/rain" roughen<br/>
the surface which would allow more "bite" - hence locking force - of a habaki in<br/>
the saya mouth.<br/>
<br/>
How many of you have seen a still well-fitting habaki in an antique koshirae<br/>
where the sword can be held upside down and vigouously shaken without the blade<br/>
falling out??  Magnificent work of the artisans.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Now that you mention it, I'm sure that the scratches also allow each<br/>
line of metal then to work with a bit of spring force. As individual<br/>
structural units, they can compress or bend slightly, which would not be<br/>
possible with the whole. <br/>
<br/>
This is also something I really like about the whole field of Japanese<br/>
swords. Everything is functional.<br/>

practised his swordsmanship @ 5,000 draws a day (or more) would wear out a saya<br/>
in 6 months!!  So, who gives a stuff about wear at the scabbard mouth!!  I know<br/>
from talking with a Japanese collector that saya - even nicely lacquered ones -<br/>
were considered expendable items in the days of the samurai.  If you were<br/>
somewhat hard up, it would always be possible to glue a shaving of wood into the<br/>
scabbard mouth to re-tighten the habaki fit.<br/>

The variety of terms used to describe tsuba decorated in foreign style can be confusing (Nanban, Canton, Kagonami, etc.).  Of course Hizen, and Nagasaki in particular, was the major point of contact with foreigners and their goods.  Guards made in Europe or China would have been seen first in Hizen.  A lot of the foreign-influenced styles of "nanban tsuba" were probably initially made in Hizen.  The "dragon and vines" type is so numerous that it was probably mass produced in other parts of Japan.<br/>
<br/>
I'm sure that you can find exceptions in the usage, but most of the time the term Hizen is used for solid plate, iron guards with profuse, showy silver or multi-color nunome.  The motifs are often foreign-influenced, the plates are sometimes cupped like European guards, and they do share some decorative traits with the "dragon and vines" type like dragon motifs and a rectangular seppa dai (although in the case of the Hizen tsuba, it's usually just outlined with nunome).  I don't think I've ever seen the dragon and vines type called Hizen.<br/>
<br/>
There seems to be some consensus that the earliest nanban tsuba from the late 16th to early 17th C were made outside of Japan.  I think that is what Graham is talking about and they are rather rare.  The huge majority of pieces that we see in "dragon in vines" style are later and made in Japan.<br/>
<br/>
Foreign influence found its way into arts beyond tsuba.  There were various nanban-style wares made in Japan, lacquer chests and furnishings (even nanban saya), clothing, painting, etc.  The nanban items made in Japan must far outnumber the imported ones that inspired them.<br/>

<br/>
The Euro NTHK is in it infancy. Our representative is Dr. Graham Curtis, and<br/>
he is getting a lot of support from the Northern UK club as well as ex-TSGB<br/>
members in the South. I don't want to get into the Euro politics - there's<br/>
enough here to keep me happy - but I think the ties between the TSGB and the<br/>
NTHK are limited.<br/>

Thanks for the great explanation Jim. I would just like to reiterate how<br/>
much I enjoy and appreciate being on this list, please keep up the good<br/>
work! It is great to have people share their knowledge like this. <br/>
<br/>
Ps. Does anyone here know what the state of affairs is with the European<br/>
(real) NTHK? Would I be correct in assuming that they have pretty close<br/>
ties to the Token Society of Great Britain? At the moment Darcy and me<br/>
are working on a proposal to keep the society alive, which will probably<br/>
include a new website. I thought we might be able to do something with<br/>
the European NTHK branch on this? <br/>

Onderwerp: Re: [nihontostudy] Nanban Tsuba<br/>

<br/>
Matt,<br/>
The variety of terms used to describe tsuba decorated in foreign style<br/>
can be confusing (Nanban, Canton, Kagonami, etc.).  Of course Hizen, and<br/>
Nagasaki in particular, was the major point of contact with foreigners<br/>
and their goods.  Guards made in Europe or China would have been seen<br/>
first in Hizen.  A lot of the foreign-influenced styles of "nanban<br/>
tsuba" were probably initially made in Hizen.  The "dragon and vines"<br/>
type is so numerous that it was probably mass produced in other parts of<br/>
Japan.<br/>
<br/>
I'm sure that you can find exceptions in the usage, but most of the time<br/>
the term Hizen is used for solid plate, iron guards with profuse, showy<br/>
silver or multi-color nunome.  The motifs are often foreign-influenced,<br/>
the plates are sometimes cupped like European guards, and they do share<br/>
some decorative traits with the "dragon and vines" type like dragon<br/>
motifs and a rectangular seppa dai (although in the case of the Hizen<br/>
tsuba, it's usually just outlined with nunome).  I don't think I've ever<br/>
seen the dragon and vines type called Hizen.<br/>
<br/>
There seems to be some consensus that the earliest nanban tsuba from the<br/>
late 16th to early 17th C were made outside of Japan.  I think that is<br/>
what Graham is talking about and they are rather rare.  The huge<br/>
majority of pieces that we see in "dragon in vines" style are later and<br/>
made in Japan.<br/>
<br/>
Foreign influence found its way into arts beyond tsuba.  There were<br/>
various nanban-style wares made in Japan, lacquer chests and furnishings<br/>
(even nanban saya), clothing, painting, etc.  The nanban items made in<br/>
Japan must far outnumber the imported ones that inspired them.<br/>
<br/>
Jim<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  Gang, going off topic a little, but still on the Graham Gemmel Book,<br/>
at<br/>
  one point he discusses a nanban type tsuba with the very busy 'dragon<br/>
in<br/>
  vines' type of decoration that is associated with 'Canton' style. <br/>
<br/>
  He reckons that these tsuba were actually made in China and India,<br/>
where<br/>
  they were ordered by the Dutch who then sold them in Japan! <br/>
<br/>
  He goes on to say that alot of these tsuba were actually made<br/>
somewhere<br/>
  other than Japan, and they are quite different to Nanban tsuba, which<br/>
  simply means in 'foreign taste' or done in 'foreign metal' etc etc. <br/>
<br/>
  And while we are on the subject, what is the difference between Hizen<br/>
  and Nanban tsuba? They must have alot in common simply because they<br/>
were<br/>
  probably made in more or less the same place I assume?<br/>
<br/>

Showy nunome on iron plate certainly does not exclude the Shoami.  Or Kyo-Kenjo.  Is it done in nanban style motifs?  Post a photo if you can.<br/>

I'm going to spend more time thinking about my next wish, then.<br/>
<br/>
Good call.  The decoration does look like Hizen work, which is unusual for the Iyo Shoami.  Is there by a personal name on the other side?  I wonder if the maker worked in Kyushu previously or was just copying the style.  The Iyo Shoami generally did not go in for that much nunome decoration.  The rim treatment kind of looks like the late Jingo/Kumagai work.  The man was a Kyushu stylist serving the greater Shikoku market I suppose.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, the use of that character for shu in Yoshu (Iyo) is something that the Iyo Shoami tended to do.<br/>
