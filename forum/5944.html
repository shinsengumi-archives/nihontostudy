<div id="ygrps-yiv-1389512899">Update from the NCJSC To-Ken Taikai - www.ncjsc.org -  they have sold out all tables. They have sold out the room block - over 400 room nights! - the hotel has extended our room block, so if you want the show rate now is the time to make your hotel reservation.<br/>
Confirmations for Shinsa registrations have gone out already, so if you are on the fence about coming now is the time to register your swords and make your hotel reservation.<br/>

	Very sorry to report folks that I misunderstood yesterdays report. We did indeed sell out all tables - we did indeed sell out our block of rooms - the hotel did expand our block to accommodate more of us - HOWEVER the Sword Show rate expired 30 days before the show, so there are no more rooms available at the special rate.<br/>
	It will still be a great show and well worth it, even if the bargain rate no longer applies�<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-342692839">Folks it was a great weekend and a very successful shinsa. I am posting to this forum for a piece of lost and found from the weekend. One of our customers in the shinsa room left behind a sword-bag and we fear it may have got packed with someone else's case by mistake. If you were there saturday afternoon and came home with an extra sword-bag do let us know.<br/>
	I will post a photo of a similar bag in the group galleries�<br/>
