<h3>NBTHK</h3>
by <i>maiorian</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-910857054">The information below was found by a friend of mine.<br/>
<br/>
Three directors, including the Chairman, who were due to retire soon, have been resigned by the NBTHK on full pay until their retirement date. Two of these were retired policemen.<br/>
The Chairman has been replaced by Mr Sasa.<br/>
The problem was that the Bunka-Cho had given a directive that the NBTHK panel should not put their own swords, nor those owned by their relatives, up for examination. The NBTHK rebelled against this, but Mr Goto, the two policemen and two others  - that is five out of fourteen directors - agreed with the Bunka-Cho code. <br/>
The dismissed three are appealing that their contract should not be ended since it was somehow arranged between the Police Department and the NBTHK. There are legal mutterings. <br/>
It was shown by the previous Chairman Goto, that between 2001 when the Bunka-Cho directive was announced , and today, there have been 515 instances of that directive having been contravened.<br/>
Tokyo Shimbun.<br/>
<br/>
The above was published on the Chunichi WEB Press in Japanese on 11 September, and taken from the Tokyo Shimbun report of 3 September.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Not sure what you heard, but as far as I know, the NBTHK is up and running and healthy. A lot of the Japanese left to join the newly established Nihonto Bunka Shinko Kyokai (NBSK) but I can't elaborate on that, being a midwesterner looking in from the outside. Politics, I'm sure. <br/>

  Has the NBTHK found its way out of its troubles yet?<br/>
<br/>
  And how did it lose its government approved status?<br/>
