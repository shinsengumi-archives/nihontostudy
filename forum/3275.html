<h3>thought&#39;s on tsuba history</h3>
by <i>retalt</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-163021939">all, thinking about an Akasaka guard in my collection, I was re reading <br/>
some thoughts on the style of work that concerned Akasaka and also Tosa <br/>
Myochin. Guards that are made with traditional sword forging and display <br/>
hada clearly in the Ha, generally Mokume, are thought to have a larger <br/>
hada in the older guards and finer hada in the later Edo examples.<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone ever heard this before or can confirm this ?.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers<br/>
