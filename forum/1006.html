<h3>Re: NEW BOOKS</h3>
by <i>gentleman9</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1667688883">Alan and all,<br/>
<br/>
I looked over your books list and found that you and I<br/>
share a few books in our inventories. Prices are a<br/>
little different but I am getting them here in Japan<br/>
while you have to ship them from here to the UK. I can<br/>
beat your shipping prices to the U.S. as I ship USPS<br/>
but for those who live in and around Europe you<br/>
probably have me beat on shipping not to mention<br/>
delivery time. So I'm going to suggest that anyone<br/>
that lives in Europe that requests books from me I'll<br/>
send them to you first if you can't get it then I'll<br/>
see if I can fill their orders from here in Japan. So<br/>
this goes out to all you folks that buy books: Please<br/>
if you live in Europe save yourself shipping costs and<br/>
time waiting and go through Alan you'll get a much<br/>
better price that way not to mention you won't have to<br/>
wait nearly as long to receive your order. As far as<br/>
what books in my inventory that both Alan and I share<br/>
and prices go here's what I've got:<br/>
<br/>
MASAMUNE Sano Museum Exhibition  Catalogue 2002,<br/>
8.75"x11.5" paper covers, 169pp illustrates 59 blades<br/>
by both b&w plates and superb oshigata. The book<br/>
covers the Soshu trad- ition from Kunitsuna through<br/>
Masamune to shinto makers like Shinkai and Kiyomaro.<br/>
There is a brief English index to the plates.       <br/>
GBP32 = USD $53.70 <br/>
<br/>
My Price: $50 USD + $10 USD shipping to the U.S.<br/>
<br/>
NIHON NO BIJUTSU #431 Swords From the Fujisawa<br/>
Collection, by Hiroi, 7.25"x9" paper  covers, 106pp <br/>
of which  are plates illustrating blades and mountings<br/>
donated to the NBTHK by Fujisawa Otoyasu.        <br/>
GBP19 = USD $31.88<br/>
<br/>
My Price: $35 USD + $4 USD for shipping to the U.S.<br/>
(Might have to lower my price to compete on this one)<br/>
<br/>
SOSOKI NO NIHONTO Early curved Japanese Swords. Sano<br/>
Museum Exhibition Catalogue 2003. 8.75"x11.5" soft<br/>
covers. 139pp illustrating 59 very early blades<br/>
including rare Mogusa smiths, Hoki Yasutsuna, Bungo<br/>
Yukihira and Sadahide, Choen, Kuninaga & Kanenaga.<br/>
Explores and explains the origins of curved blades<br/>
from the Heian to the early Kamakura period. English<br/>
index for the plates.<br/>
GBP32 = USD $53.70<br/>
<br/>
My Price: $50 USD + $10 USD shipping to the U.S.<br/>
(This one's not listed on my site but I have it)<br/>
<br/>
SATSUMA KOSHIRAE by Zusho, 62x8.5", 129pp of which 38<br/>
are plates (16 in colour) illustrating the various<br/>
types of sword mountings po[pular in Satsuma, plus<br/>
16pp of illustrations from the Satsuma auction sale<br/>
catalogue of 1928.<br/>
GBP31 = USD $52.02<br/>
<br/>
My Price: $55 USD + $4 USD shipping to the U.S.<br/>
(Might have to lower my price to compete on this one) <br/>
<br/>
I'm hoping that after the holidays or during my off<br/>
time during the holiday break I'll get a chance to<br/>
update my site. But if anyone has any questions please<br/>
drop me an email and ask.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-20815356">Naaa not really competition I want everyone to get the<br/>
best possible price on what they want. That's why I<br/>
list ISBN#'s for books on my site that way you can<br/>
search for the book elsewhere if you so desire. I also<br/>
direct customers to where they can get things the<br/>
cheapest even if it's not me. I just want to make sure<br/>
that folks aren't paying $170 bucks for a $30 book.<br/>
