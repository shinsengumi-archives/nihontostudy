<h3>Re: [nihontostudy] tsuba designs?</h3>
by <i>yamaimojg</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1951427334">Matt,<br/>
Yes in answer to all questions.  There are references to some of the top kinko working with an eminent contemporary painter to develop their designs.  I don't know if there is hard proof for these claims, but they are frequently made.  It seems plausible, since a good draughtsman and metalworker isn't necessarily an inventive designer.<br/>
<br/>
I'm not aware of any specific mention of customer-designed themes, but it'd be hard to imagine that it didn't happen.  There are stories about some of the famous early chado (tea) masters having ceramic work made to their specifications by others.  Come to think of it, I suppose that the Yagyu tsuba are probably a good example of customer design that was fabricated by a number of different makers both known and unknown.  I haven't seen an original Yagyu design book, but I have a photocopy of a later hand-drawn copy of one.<br/>
<br/>
I have seen some original design books for shiiremono tsuba.  They are full of generic sorts of Nara-esq designs.  Someone had broken one of these up and was selling individual pages at one of the sword shows years ago.  They seem to be about the equivalent of tattoo parlor "flash."<br/>
<br/>
There are at least several fittings books that show illustrations taken from surviving design books from known makers.  One that happens to come to mind is Futagoyama Norisuke Ko, where about half of the book is illustrations of detailed sketches and oshigata by the Norisuke.  Some are original designs but quite a few are classic Yagyu, Yamakichibei, etc., that were presumably used as guides for their forgery work.  <br/>
<br/>
I suspect that most if not all makers would have had documents like these.  Basically sketch books for working out designs and oshigata to record finished works or works by others.  Probably well more than half of the fittings makers that ever worked made their living by simply turning out copies of standard designs that they did not create.  The number of real innovators isn't large, but these are of course the big names.<br/>
<br/>
Many fittings motifs are elaborations of things that have been in the culture for many years and it would be hard to credit a given designer.  Even some of the famous innovators' work was in coming up with a novel twist on an old theme.  Most of them then proceeded to repeat themselves for the remainder of their careers, and their followers mostly did the same.<br/>
<br/>
The first Yasuchika is one maker who really stands out for me in not doing this.  Going through a book of his work, it's remarkable how many times he would develop something really good and then leave it to go on to something different and also great.  His fabrication skill in both iron and copper alloy is incredible and he was either a great designer or knew the right people to work with (or steal from).<br/>
<br/>

  so often on tsuba? Was this done by the actual tsuba-maker, or by a<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1672049613">Matt,<br/>
I think that Graham is talking about putting the final texture on the guard.  The forging and shaping of the plate would be done with a normal hammer.  Some iron guards are indeed finished with an array of tiny pock marks like he describes.  It's more likely that this was done with a small punch that was struck with a hammer rather than directly with a pin-headed hammer.  It'd be a lot easier to place and control the punch, and quicker to make and maintain the tool.  But, I wasn't there to see it done.<br/>
<br/>
Most Ko-Katchushi don't show this, BTW.  If they ever had it the traces have rusted away.  It's easier to find on some later work.<br/>

Matt,<br/>
I think that Graham is talking about putting the final texture on the<br/>
guard.  The forging and shaping of the plate would be done with a normal<br/>
hammer.  Some iron guards are indeed finished with an array of tiny pock<br/>
marks like he describes.  It's more likely that this was done with a<br/>
small punch that was struck with a hammer rather than directly with a<br/>
pin-headed hammer.  It'd be a lot easier to place and control the punch,<br/>
and quicker to make and maintain the tool.  But, I wasn't there to see<br/>
it done.<br/>
<br/>
Most Ko-Katchushi don't show this, BTW.  If they ever had it the traces<br/>
have rusted away.  It's easier to find on some later work.<br/>
Jim<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  Gang I am reading Graham Gemmells book 'Tosogu, treasure of the<br/>
samurai'<br/>
  where he discusses an early - mid Muromachi ko-katchushi tsuba and<br/>
  mentions that a hammer nearly the size of a pin head was used to work<br/>
  (and fold?) the steel, and thus create the textures in the iron that<br/>
  make these things so pleasing to look at. I have some real trouble<br/>
  imagining this being done. I presume he is talking about a hammer a<br/>
bit<br/>
  like an ice-pick with a very small surface that actually strikes the<br/>
  metal? Why not just use a big one like the sword smith?<br/>

I doubt that the finish of early Akasaka guards was produced by the same sort of tooling.  They do have a unique surface texture that is very uniform and fine grained.  They are known for using a sandwiched construction with a hard skin layer, but I do not know how that layer was finished.  <br/>
<br/>
A common metal working technique is to make a texturing punch from annealed steel by driving it into nicely grained stone and then hardening it.  It's possible that Ko-Akasaka guards were finished with this sort of tool, but the surface doesn't look beaten down and the effect is very uniform.  My guess is that it was done another way.<br/>

<h3>RE: [nihontostudy] Ko-Katchushi tsuba.....</h3>
by <i>Peter A Bleed</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1633660130">Matt,<br/>
You have engendered an interesting discussion and elicited Jim's usually<br/>
worthwhile insights. Thanks<br/>
In response to your comments, I took a look again and some of my katchushi<br/>
guards last night (they used to be so common and cheap that I couldn't<br/>
avoid becoming a 'collector'). I have always loved the finish of these<br/>
tsuba which looks old and natural but which is also obviously the creation<br/>
of human intention. I am not familiar with Gemmell's book, but - like Jim -<br/>
I am sceptical about the use of a pointed hammer to created tsuba surfaces.<br/>
I can believe that a kinko might make and use a hammer with a network of<br/>
very fine points. As I think about it, use of irregular hammer and anvil<br/>
surfaces during the forging of the initial plate might be a means of<br/>
setting up the internal irregularities we call bones etc.<br/>
I agree with Jim, too, that whatever means was used to created a surface<br/>
finish, it probably involved a chisel or punch rather than direct pounding<br/>
with a hammer.<br/>
In that regard, let me recall a conversation with Hagawa-san, the Sendai<br/>
kinko I have mentioned to the list before. He makes frequent use of<br/>
"ishime" which is a smooth but 'irregular' surface of small dots that looks<br/>
like a stone (ishi means stone). He told me that ishime is as hard to do as<br/>
nanako. It is done with specially crested punches ('tagane') that are<br/>
struck with a hammer - one dot at a time. Hagawa-san said that once<br/>
started, an entire surface had to be done in one setting to assure a<br/>
uniform texture. If the work was interrupted, the piece will be ruined.<br/>
Thus, before he starts an ishime surface, he tells his wife and family that<br/>
they should not interrupt him til the tapping stopped. Maybe the point here<br/>
is that even if special tools are used, it is still the craftsman's skill<br/>
and intensity that matters.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1652899706">Great insights Peter. Now I have thought it over some more I would have<br/>
to agree with you and Jim. Would love to find out if they did indeed use<br/>
an irregular hammer and anvil in the old days, I wonder if anyone else<br/>
could give us some more thoughts on this? <br/>
 <br/>
I can highly recommend Graham Gemmell's book: Tosogu, treasure of the<br/>
samurai. It is infact a catalog of an exhibition/sale held in London in<br/>
'91 at a big name Gallery.  Very beautiful book with great illustrations<br/>
and very interesting thoughts on the pieces that were on show. Also it<br/>
just occured to me that none of these pieces are papered, at least there<br/>
is no mention of any papers whatsoever anywhere in the catalog. <br/>
 <br/>
Talking about surface finishes, I was wondering about the 'cat scratch'<br/>
finish we often see on the back of kozuka and kogai. What purpose does<br/>
this serve and when did this practice begin? Is it at all related to<br/>
'cat scratch habaki' that have that texture not only for the beauty of<br/>
it, but also because it secures the sword in the saya a tiny bit more?<br/>
Also we often see this motif in combination with a polished shakudo or<br/>
other ground, sometimes in the form of two triangles, sometimes simply<br/>
two rectangles next to each other. Is there any reason for this, a<br/>
kantei point perhaps?<br/>

Matt,<br/>
You have engendered an interesting discussion and elicited Jim's usually<br/>
worthwhile insights. Thanks<br/>
In response to your comments, I took a look again and some of my<br/>
katchushi<br/>
guards last night (they used to be so common and cheap that I couldn't<br/>
avoid becoming a 'collector'). I have always loved the finish of these<br/>
tsuba which looks old and natural but which is also obviously the<br/>
creation<br/>
of human intention. I am not familiar with Gemmell's book, but - like<br/>
Jim -<br/>
I am sceptical about the use of a pointed hammer to created tsuba<br/>
surfaces.<br/>
I can believe that a kinko might make and use a hammer with a network of<br/>
very fine points. As I think about it, use of irregular hammer and anvil<br/>
surfaces during the forging of the initial plate might be a means of<br/>
setting up the internal irregularities we call bones etc.<br/>
I agree with Jim, too, that whatever means was used to created a surface<br/>
finish, it probably involved a chisel or punch rather than direct<br/>
pounding<br/>
with a hammer.<br/>
In that regard, let me recall a conversation with Hagawa-san, the Sendai<br/>
kinko I have mentioned to the list before. He makes frequent use of<br/>
"ishime" which is a smooth but 'irregular' surface of small dots that<br/>
looks<br/>
like a stone (ishi means stone). He told me that ishime is as hard to do<br/>
as<br/>
nanako. It is done with specially crested punches ('tagane') that are<br/>
struck with a hammer - one dot at a time. Hagawa-san said that once<br/>
started, an entire surface had to be done in one setting to assure a<br/>
uniform texture. If the work was interrupted, the piece will be ruined.<br/>
Thus, before he starts an ishime surface, he tells his wife and family<br/>
that<br/>
they should not interrupt him til the tapping stopped. Maybe the point<br/>
here<br/>
is that even if special tools are used, it is still the craftsman's<br/>
skill<br/>
and intensity that matters.<br/>

When you think of it, if an artist is so talented and has such control to create every other aspect of a tsuba, why would he not have that ability when applying a finish like you speak of? Just a marvel, to somebody who has trouble trimming toenails evenly!<br/>

Subject: Re: [nihontostudy] tsuba designs?<br/>

Matt,<br/>
Yes in answer to all questions.  There are references to some of the top<br/>
kinko working with an eminent contemporary painter to develop their designs.<br/>
I don't know if there is hard proof for these claims, but they are<br/>
frequently made.  It seems plausible, since a good draughtsman and<br/>
metalworker isn't necessarily an inventive designer.<br/>
<br/>
I'm not aware of any specific mention of customer-designed themes, but it'd<br/>
be hard to imagine that it didn't happen.  There are stories about some of<br/>
the famous early chado (tea) masters having ceramic work made to their<br/>
specifications by others.  Come to think of it, I suppose that the Yagyu<br/>
tsuba are probably a good example of customer design that was fabricated by<br/>
a number of different makers both known and unknown.  I haven't seen an<br/>
original Yagyu design book, but I have a photocopy of a later hand-drawn<br/>
copy of one.<br/>
<br/>
I have seen some original design books for shiiremono tsuba.  They are full<br/>
of generic sorts of Nara-esq designs.  Someone had broken one of these up<br/>
and was selling individual pages at one of the sword shows years ago.  They<br/>
seem to be about the equivalent of tattoo parlor "flash."<br/>
<br/>
There are at least several fittings books that show illustrations taken from<br/>
surviving design books from known makers.  One that happens to come to mind<br/>
is Futagoyama Norisuke Ko, where about half of the book is illustrations of<br/>
detailed sketches and oshigata by the Norisuke.  Some are original designs<br/>
but quite a few are classic Yagyu, Yamakichibei, etc., that were presumably<br/>
used as guides for their forgery work.  <br/>
<br/>
I suspect that most if not all makers would have had documents like these.<br/>
Basically sketch books for working out designs and oshigata to record<br/>
finished works or works by others.  Probably well more than half of the<br/>
fittings makers that ever worked made their living by simply turning out<br/>
copies of standard designs that they did not create.  The number of real<br/>
innovators isn't large, but these are of course the big names.<br/>
<br/>
Many fittings motifs are elaborations of things that have been in the<br/>
culture for many years and it would be hard to credit a given designer.<br/>
Even some of the famous innovators' work was in coming up with a novel twist<br/>
on an old theme.  Most of them then proceeded to repeat themselves for the<br/>
remainder of their careers, and their followers mostly did the same.<br/>
<br/>
The first Yasuchika is one maker who really stands out for me in not doing<br/>
this.  Going through a book of his work, it's remarkable how many times he<br/>
would develop something really good and then leave it to go on to something<br/>
different and also great.  His fabrication skill in both iron and copper<br/>
alloy is incredible and he was either a great designer or knew the right<br/>
people to work with (or steal from).<br/>
<br/>
Jim  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  Guys I am wondering who actually designed decorative themes that we see<br/>
  so often on tsuba? Was this done by the actual tsuba-maker, or by a<br/>
  contracted artisan or by the client or someone else? <br/>
<br/>
  And were these designs published in books somewhere along the line so<br/>
  that later generations could copy these designs? If this is the case do<br/>
  any of these books survive to this day? Are there any reprints?<br/>
<br/>

<h3>Re: [nihontostudy] Ko-Katchushi tsuba.....</h3>
by <i>yamaimojg</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2028145288">Matt,<br/>
The earliest use of "cat scratch" filework on the back of kozuka and kogai that I am aware of is from the middle Muromachi period on Goto Yujo's work (the first generation).  I haven't seen it on any older Ko-Kinko, etc., but expect that it could have existed.  It's quite common in the Goto school on gold.  I have seen illustrations of a couple of Goto examples with shakudo backs with this treatment, but it is rather unusual and might not have been original.  You'll note that when the Goto used shakudo and gold together in the decorative patterns you mention, the gold will be filed and the shakudo will be polished.  <br/>
<br/>
My guess is that this technique was a way to put a uniform matte finish on the gold so that it wasn't too showy.  I doubt that it was for friction, since if it was why not treat the shakudo pieces the same way?  Maybe it also helps to make small scratches and dings in the gold surface from wear less obvious.  Other ideas?<br/>
<br/>
Lots of machibori (non-Goto) kinko also used this technique on a wide variety of metals, but even there it's most commonly seen on gold.  I don't think that it can be used as a definitive kantei point, but it is certainly something to observe and consider.  The machibori groups also used those decorative patterns of gold and other metals.  Of course some late kinko makers also made some fittings of polished gold, and yes, they are showy indeed.<br/>
Jim<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  Talking about surface finishes, I was wondering about the 'cat scratch'<br/>
  finish we often see on the back of kozuka and kogai. What purpose does<br/>
  this serve and when did this practice begin? Is it at all related to<br/>
  'cat scratch habaki' that have that texture not only for the beauty of<br/>
  it, but also because it secures the sword in the saya a tiny bit more?<br/>
  Also we often see this motif in combination with a polished shakudo or<br/>
  other ground, sometimes in the form of two triangles, sometimes simply<br/>
  two rectangles next to each other. Is there any reason for this, a<br/>
  kantei point perhaps?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1058840642">I don't remember Matt.  My impression is that it was a lot more than one would normally expect 8 big, glossy, expensive Japanese fittings books to be.

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1923200544">Hi Jim,<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
The 690,000 seems right, but the other number could be as well. The main<br/>
thing I remember was that there was a lot of non-fittings related stuff that<br/>
made it a bit too far removed for any but a totally dedicated fittings<br/>
person. I almost expected you to have made the plunge. I rather doubt if<br/>
they sold very many of those. On a sort of related note, the big Masamune<br/>
and his school book, which has a list price of over 100,000 yen is selling<br/>
for 40,000 and I got mine for 38,000. I wish I had known about the big book<br/>
sell off at the museum, but I already bought most of what I wanted for full<br/>
price earlier on.<br/>

There was an 8 volume Natsuo set in last June's sale at Christie's estimated<br/>
at £1000-1500, it didn't sell. It is basically text with the illustrations<br/>
spread throughout the set, there was however a single volume of all the<br/>

: You have engendered an interesting discussion and elicited Jim's usually<br/>

: In response to your comments, I took a look again and some of my<br/>
: katchushi<br/>
: guards last night (they used to be so common and cheap that I couldn't<br/>
: avoid becoming a 'collector'). I have always loved the finish of these<br/>
: tsuba which looks old and natural but which is also obviously the<br/>
: creation<br/>
: of human intention. I am not familiar with Gemmell's book, but - like<br/>
: Jim -<br/>
: I am sceptical about the use of a pointed hammer to created tsuba<br/>
: surfaces.<br/>
: I can believe that a kinko might make and use a hammer with a network of<br/>
: very fine points. As I think about it, use of irregular hammer and anvil<br/>
: surfaces during the forging of the initial plate might be a means of<br/>
: setting up the internal irregularities we call bones etc.<br/>
: I agree with Jim, too, that whatever means was used to created a surface<br/>
: finish, it probably involved a chisel or punch rather than direct<br/>
: pounding<br/>
: with a hammer.<br/>
: In that regard, let me recall a conversation with Hagawa-san, the Sendai<br/>
: kinko I have mentioned to the list before. He makes frequent use of<br/>
: "ishime" which is a smooth but 'irregular' surface of small dots that<br/>
: looks<br/>
: like a stone (ishi means stone). He told me that ishime is as hard to do<br/>
: as<br/>
: nanako. It is done with specially crested punches ('tagane') that are<br/>
: struck with a hammer - one dot at a time. Hagawa-san said that once<br/>
: started, an entire surface had to be done in one setting to assure a<br/>
: uniform texture. If the work was interrupted, the piece will be ruined.<br/>
: Thus, before he starts an ishime surface, he tells his wife and family<br/>
: that<br/>
: they should not interrupt him til the tapping stopped. Maybe the point<br/>
: here<br/>
: is that even if special tools are used, it is still the craftsman's<br/>
: skill<br/>
: and intensity that matters.<br/>

: : You have engendered an interesting discussion and elicited Jim's<br/>
: usually<br/>
: : worthwhile insights. Thanks<br/>
: : In response to your comments, I took a look again and some of my<br/>
: : katchushi<br/>
: : guards last night (they used to be so common and cheap that I couldn't<br/>
: : avoid becoming a 'collector'). I have always loved the finish of these<br/>
: : tsuba which looks old and natural but which is also obviously the<br/>
: : creation<br/>
: : of human intention. I am not familiar with Gemmell's book, but - like<br/>
: : Jim -<br/>
: : I am sceptical about the use of a pointed hammer to created tsuba<br/>
: : surfaces.<br/>
: : I can believe that a kinko might make and use a hammer with a network<br/>
: of<br/>
: : very fine points. As I think about it, use of irregular hammer and<br/>
: anvil<br/>
: : surfaces during the forging of the initial plate might be a means of<br/>
: : setting up the internal irregularities we call bones etc.<br/>
: : I agree with Jim, too, that whatever means was used to created a<br/>
: surface<br/>
: : finish, it probably involved a chisel or punch rather than direct<br/>
: : pounding<br/>
: : with a hammer.<br/>
: : In that regard, let me recall a conversation with Hagawa-san, the<br/>
: Sendai<br/>
: : kinko I have mentioned to the list before. He makes frequent use of<br/>
: : "ishime" which is a smooth but 'irregular' surface of small dots that<br/>
: : looks<br/>
: : like a stone (ishi means stone). He told me that ishime is as hard to<br/>
: do<br/>
: : as<br/>
: : nanako. It is done with specially crested punches ('tagane') that are<br/>
: : struck with a hammer - one dot at a time. Hagawa-san said that once<br/>
: : started, an entire surface had to be done in one setting to assure a<br/>
: : uniform texture. If the work was interrupted, the piece will be<br/>
: ruined.<br/>
: : Thus, before he starts an ishime surface, he tells his wife and family<br/>
: : that<br/>
: : they should not interrupt him til the tapping stopped. Maybe the point<br/>
: : here<br/>
: : is that even if special tools are used, it is still the craftsman's<br/>
: : skill<br/>
: : and intensity that matters.<br/>
