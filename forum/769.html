<h3>Nunome-zogan</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1419451934">List-eners,<br/>
      Has there been a synthetic study of nunome zogan? This is the<br/>
Japanese term for the overlay techniques that places gold or silver leaf on<br/>
steel by rubbing it into/onto very fine cross hatched striations. When well<br/>
done it is very beautiful, but often it is either entirely gone or survives<br/>
only as traces. Do we know when and where it originated in Japan? And where<br/>
else is it practiced?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The same technique is widely used on middle eastern swords <br/>
and knives. Done in both gold and silver. I have a few pieces<br/>
from the middle east and India with the decor done in<br/>
nunome-zogan; generally scrolling vines and small floral<br/>
patterns.<br/>

<br/>
funny you are talking about this nunome zogan..........<br/>
please take a look see at list album  ( milt's )  or <br/>
klick.........<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://tinyurl.com/n77z">http://tinyurl.com/n77z</a><br/>
 the two Kyo-sukashi tsuba.<br/>
One has nunome zogan applied/added on later.I deduced it's a later <br/>
application as part of the iron has been eroded resulting in lower <br/>
level ( sort of like chips ), yet there are nunome zogan intact there.<br/>
<br/>
The two tsuba has identical design of Kiri mon with scroll. The <br/>
design is illustrated in Sasano's sukashi book.<br/>

I'm not aware of such a study.  It would be a great topic for an article in the Bulletin of the Metals Museum.  My impression is that nunome zogan first appears on Japanese sword fittings in the late Muromachi period.  Where it originates is an even harder question, but nunome zogan is strongly associated with Ko-Shoami work and some sources place the origin of the Ko-Shoami in Kyoto.<br/>
<br/>
I have seen some very sophisticated gold and silver inlay on iron from North China ca. 5th-4th C BC, and of course complex Tang metalwork, but I can't recall nunome type inlay from that time.  As Rich mentioned "nunome" is seen elsewhere in the Middle East and Asia.  I have seen nunome-style inlay on old European material as well.  There is an "Anglo-Scandinavian" iron stirrup in the Metropolitan Museum from the 10-11th C with brass inlay that is affixed with a nunome-type technique.<br/>
<br/>
I have a few pages of notes from Bob Haynes where he records various nunome cross hatching styles seen on tsuba and attempts to correlate them to their various makers. <br/>

I just saw an Indian dagger in the Asian Art Museum in San Francisco that had gold inlay on the blade done this way no doubt, actually in the kind of tendril designs we see so often on Japanese metalwork. It had a walrus ivory handle, a very attractive item. Unfortunately my notes on it's date and place are temporarily inaccessible, and my digital camera batteries died just after I got to the museum.<br/>

Jim and Others,<br/>
      Thanks for the replies. I too have noted that the technique we call<br/>
nunome turns up in lots of premodern metal working traditions. In addition<br/>
to those noted, I have seen it on Tibetan and "Chinese" stuff, most notably<br/>
in our area of interest on Chinese "Namban" tsuba, for example. The<br/>
explicit item that triggered my question is an iron six-sided vase I have<br/>
with heavy (but not very attractive) silver overlay that I think is Korean.<br/>
Does anyone know the Korean word for such stuff, by the way?<br/>
      I have also noted that the earliest apparent occurrences of this<br/>
technique on Japanese stuff all seem to have a Muromachi sort of age. Given<br/>
its apparent world-wide distribution of the technique, it must have either<br/>
been introduced or invented in Japan at that time, OR, older stuff has not<br/>
survived. I tend to favor the later idea.<br/>
      It is possible, I betcha, that the fine iron striations that hold the<br/>
gold/silver on, simply won't survive more than about 500 years. If they<br/>
largely oxidize away in that kind of time frame, all older examples would<br/>
be gone so it would look like nunome suddenly appeared.<br/>
      Let me add, in closing, that virtually all of the techniques Japanese<br/>
kinko use do show up in other parts of the world and other artistic<br/>
traditions. The Japanese like to see themselves as innovators in this<br/>
regard, but what they really did, IMHO, is bring basic techniques to high<br/>
levels of virtuosity. This weekend I bought a couple of swords. One is a<br/>
rather ordinary nippon-to, but the other a really nice cuphilt (Spanish?)<br/>
rapier that is embellished with light repousse, good horidashi engraving,<br/>
and a wonderfully even "nanako-ishime" finish that is as nice as any on an<br/>
iron tsuba. Craftsmanship is where we find it, mebbe.<br/>

Agreed.<br/>
<br/>
I don't know anything about the Korean version of nunome but I'll look into it.  It is interesting that we have well preserved "true" inlay on Kofun period fittings and even swords, as well as pieces with sheet gold overlay but no nunome examples.  It is hard to believe that the technique was unknown or unexploited prior to the Muromachi period.<br/>
