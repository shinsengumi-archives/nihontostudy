considered the king (if not the queen) of all flowers.  The pair symbolizes<br/>
the best/strongest.  The pairing of lion and peony is a Chinese concept,<br/>
and the design is still seen today among Chinese works of art/craft.  The<br/>
peony was brought to Japan from Tang China as medicine, and the flower<br/>
became popular among Heian court nobles.  Stylized botan flower became<br/>
popular design motif, including the "mon" crest, by the Kamakura period.  A<br/>
branch of the Genji clan in Settsu Province used a "mon" showing shishi and<br/>
botan around that period (ca. 1300), so the pairing has been in Japan for<br/>
some time.  <br/>

The botan/shishi pair was (still is?) also a popular irezumi (tattoo) motif<br/>

this most interesting thread. I do have a (silly) question though, I<br/>
thought that the Dragon was King of all animals, like in China where it<br/>
symbolizes the Emperor among other things. If this is not the case in<br/>
Japan, could someone please explain the meaning of the Dragon in<br/>
Japanese art ? <br/>
 <br/>
Also in China there are a number of myth. beasts that are "children of<br/>
the dragon", is this the case in Japan also ?<br/>

I've also read somewhere (Joly's?) about some princess (or queen?) was for some reason transformed into a shishi and that the peony was her favorite food, thus the association.  It is a wonderful motif and I have a number of very nice shakudo and shakudo/gold menuki depicting shishi and peony.  <br/>

  considered the king (if not the queen) of all flowers.  The pair symbolizes<br/>
  the best/strongest.  The pairing of lion and peony is a Chinese concept,<br/>
