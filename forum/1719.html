<h3>Wakizashi Help</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1297744947">Hi,<br/>
 <br/>
Can anyone assist me with this Wakizashi? I'm after more information on the<br/>
style and school of the mounts. I was told that due to the style of the<br/>
mounts it would have been a merchants or high class civilian's sword. Can<br/>
anyone confirm or deny this?<br/>
The grove cut into the saya does look to be a kind of fashion statement. The<br/>
blade is out of polish but looks to have a gunome hamon.<br/>

The original metal fittings appear to be a set by one maker or at least a single workshop.  I think that they could be work from Shonai in northern Honshu.  Is the fuchi or tsuba signed?  The kozuka is a later substitution of lower quality.  I can't really see the menuki in the photos.  The kashira appears to be of a different material.  I'm guessing that it may have been lost and that the tsuka has been rewrapped, but I can't see much in the photos.<br/>
<br/>
The bevel on the saya would be up against the body when the sword was worn so it's probably not just for show.  My guess is that it might be more comfortable to wear or would help position it somehow (?).  It's an unusual feature.  Does anyone know what it's called or what it is really for?<br/>
<br/>
As a lone wakizashi it could have been worn by a non-samurai, but I don't see anything about the koshirae that would make that necessarily so.  <br/>

Thank you for your reply.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately the tsuba and fuchi are not signed. The kashira is <br/>
lost and has been replaced with a polished horn one. The menuki are <br/>
matching good quality shakudo with gilding, catfish and plants <br/>
design.<br/>
<br/>
The blade has been cut down by several inches, so unfortunately any <br/>
signature it once had is gone.<br/>
A few people I have showed the sword to have commented on the <br/>
unusual saya bevel.<br/>
<br/>
I was told by a dealer that from the style of the sword it wouldn't <br/>
have been part of a daisho. Interestingly enough it also appears to <br/>
have battle damage on the back of the mune.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

FWIW, there's a wakizashi in this week's sale at Christie's that is mounted with a "beveled" saya similar to yours (and mixed nanban-style fittings that are not like yours).<br/>
<br/>
Also, I ran across a tsuba somewhat like yours in the Haynes auction catalog # 6, lot 208 with a signature in sosho style that looks like the style of writing used by the Shonai Sekibun makers.  Haynes translates it as Jusai.<br/>

Digging up an old post here as I've got some additional info from Steve<br/>
Smith fittings expert from Liverpool Museum & British Northern Token<br/>
Society.<br/>
 <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.c.farrar.btinternet.co.uk/wak/">http://www.c.farrar.btinternet.co.uk/wak/</a><br/>
 <br/>
The mounts are the work of Sekibun Akabumi or his brother of the same name.<br/>
Mid 19th Century. Liverpool Museum has mounts of identical type in its<br/>
inventory.<br/>
 <br/>
The mystery of the beveled saya has also now been answered by Steve. The<br/>
bevel is because the Wak was part of a daisho the katana would also have a<br/>
bevel so the two sit tightly together in the belt. This also confirms the<br/>
blade was carried by a Samurai!<br/>

Steve said that the katana would have a groove on the saya that would hold<br/>
it tight against the bevel on the wakizashi so that the two would almost<br/>
lock together. He said the bevel is fairly common on daisho wak saya's.<br/>

alternative readings of the same two kanji, it is now commonly read<br/>

	I don't mean to be obtuse but wouldn't the groove be on the outside <br/>
(omote) of the Wakizashi saya where the contact with the Katana saya <br/>
would be? Anyone else on the list seen a bevel on a daisho koshirae?<br/>

      I don't mean to be obtuse but wouldn't the groove be on the outside <br/>
(omote) of the Wakizashi saya where the contact with the Katana saya <br/>
would be? Anyone else on the list seen a bevel on a daisho koshirae?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>certainly katana were always on the left but there were "sidearmes" <br/>
mounted for wear on the right...<br/>
Looking at the "bevel" in the picture, it doesn't appear to be anywhere <br/>
near where the sword contacts the body or another sword. I am sorry I <br/>
jumped intoo the middle of this thread it just struck me as odd, <br/>
especially when we are talking about a "pair" of swords but there is no <br/>
katana with a bevel shown. I guess I am not convinced at this point.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>	I am looking at Sasama Yoshihiko's Dictionary of Japanese Arms and <br/>
Armour, many of the illustrations are lifted from source material of <br/>
the period you mention and they all seem to "stick out" pretty much the <br/>
same way on the left hip.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>	If war is our model then "comfort" would not be a factor, they wore <br/>
armour and a thick obi over that, they felt the weight of the swords <br/>
but not the saya. If the "bevel" was for comfort then I would expect it <br/>
to be an Edo period variant. I just have never seen a "daisho" that fit <br/>
together with a bevel, I wonder if anyone has seen an example published <br/>
anywhere?<br/>
