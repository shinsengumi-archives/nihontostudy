 </span></blockquote>hi Steve,<br/>
Personally, I only clean the opening IF the rust distort the outline <br/>
of the design but don't overdo it..........if in doubt  best to leave <br/>
it alone.<br/>
Another issue is " waxing " the tsuba.<br/>
I've heard many conflicting views on that............I suspect a lot <br/>
of people do that to give their tsuba that lustrous moist look, but <br/>
of course few will admit to that.<br/>
I have outbid a well known /knowledgable dealer on a can of old <br/>
japanese tsuba wax on e-bay........question is if the advance people <br/>
poo poo on waxing the tsuba then why he placed a bid ?<br/>
<br/>
Naturally you guys will ask if I wax my  tsuba.........hahahaa,  yes <br/>
and no. I used to  but I found out the wax does wear off so the <br/>
effect of the lustre is not permanent. I discovered a better way now, <br/>
no, it's not wearing it in your rear pocket (  for the SF residents ).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1013574186">Interesting story Ron, though less detail about sleeping with tsuba is <br/>
fine by me :-). I think the important thing to remember is that if you <br/>
are unsure, do what is safest, i.e a silk or cotton cloth will do little <br/>
damage so it should be fine just fussin over the tsuba that way.<br/>
<br/>
I love reading the section in Tsuba, An Aesthetic Study on the mixtures <br/>
made up in the old days that were used to bake the patina in include Rat <br/>
dung, clay, blood ect.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-737142835">BTW,<br/>
If anyone does feel the need to wax an iron tsuba, be careful to keep the wax out of the sukashi openings.  It'll get into any rust there and will not look right.<br/>
<br/>
Overall, wax is better than oiling a guard (which really makes a mess), but it shouldn't be necessary for a well treated tsuba, at least in a moderate climate.<br/>
