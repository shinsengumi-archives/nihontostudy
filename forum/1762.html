Does anyone know who the eBay seller mrvtjun is?<br/>

Some of his items look OK but others look quite questionable.<br/>

$21 postage on a small tsuba??<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I've actually got a combined shipping from them for 2 tsuba. It was 2-<br/>
3 months ago, so I don't know, maybe they aren't doing it anymore.<br/>
<br/>
Again, personally, I've got no major complaints about this seller: <br/>
shipping was fast, well packaged in respect to tsuba, etc. I wouldn't <br/>
hesitate to buy from him again once I see something I'd be interested <br/>
in.<br/>
<br/>
