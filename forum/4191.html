<h3>Mito Tsuba</h3>
by <i>excelsiorilluminati</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-670464461">Here is something that may interest some. Recently I had an online <br/>
discussion about Mito Tsuba. This tsuba's image was sent to me as an <br/>
example of Mito. Apparently there is some discussion going on about <br/>
it's age. Mr Robert Haynes has put back the date by 100 years. That <br/>
isn't what I wonder about. It is the patina and colour. Has anyone <br/>
seen this type of patina before? John<br/>

with the Haynes reference. I am checking now. It did not seem Mito <br/>

much about the patina.  It's probably reddish brown under a <br/>
