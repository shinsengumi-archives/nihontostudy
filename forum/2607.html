Mr. Weissberg evidently thinks it is gimei, my question is how can you tell?<br/>
It looks awfully similar to the ones in the books!<br/>

And if it is indeed gimei, how old is it do we think?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1989117762">Hi:<br/>
 At first glance it does look rather nice, however the mei looks<br/>
tentative, soft and not quite right to me. The first thing one would<br/>
what to do is to consult the book of Akiyama collected Nobuiye (title<br/>
escapes me without reference material here) which illustrates the vast<br/>
bulk of know Nobuiye out there. A few years ago a well known California<br/>
dealer was lucky enough to find one at a show, bought it and it<br/>
eventually went Juyo. Sure enough is found among the Akiyama oshigata.<br/>
You can be quite sure that if such a tsuba left Japan and were correct<br/>
the price would have at least another zero on the end, and probably an<br/>
initial digit change as well.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-802342239">Hi Alan, do you mean the Alexander G. Moslé collection that Sebastian Izzard<br/>
exhibited in September of last year?<br/>
<br/>
And do you think this particular forgery was done by the Shodai or Nidai<br/>
Norisuke or is that not possible to tell? Jim has an interesting example on<br/>
his webpage: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://home.earthlink.net/~jggilbert/ono.htm">http://home.earthlink.net/~jggilbert/ono.htm</a><br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the comment about Kuwabara and the iron tsuba. What was he most<br/>
knowledgeable on? (soft metal) Fuchi/Kashira and other soft metal fittings<br/>
of did he also "do swords"?<br/>
<br/>
Matt<br/>

Ps. When is the next Christies sale from the fittings museum?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-414235217">Hi Arnold, thanks for the response. Did you mean the book that these scans<br/>
came from? <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.jpsword.com/files/kn/nobuiye.html">http://www.jpsword.com/files/kn/nobuiye.html</a><br/>
This webpage is very good for making side by side comparisons with the pix<br/>
on Mr. Weissberg's website. I think I can see the sutble differences in the<br/>
mei now, or perhaps I want to believe I can *grin*. Some more pointers in<br/>
this direction might be good for me all the same. Are there any specifics to<br/>
look for besides the 'softness'?<br/>
<br/>
With regards to the Akiyama tsuba that was found, the mind boggles how it<br/>
wound up on a table at a sword show in the US among a pile of other tsuba!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1286151263">Some more observations after comparing<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.jpsword.com/files/kn/nobuiye.html">http://www.jpsword.com/files/kn/nobuiye.html</a> to<br/>

<br/>
1. The nakago and hitsu ana look 'too regular and wrongly shaped' on the<br/>
Kuwabara tsuba.<br/>
2. The mei seems to be placed a bit too low in relation to the nakago ana<br/>
and the characters are slightly too far apart(?)<br/>
3. Specifically the second character looks like it is completely out of<br/>
place, much too low, nearly next to the bottom of the nakago ana. On the<br/>
genuine examples the second character is much higher up on all of them.<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone have any more comments? I think this makes quite an interesting<br/>
exercise for the newbies like myself. (at least it is for me :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-52566967">Last comment/observation: I get the distinct impression that all the hitsu<br/>
ana on the genuine Nobuiye examples were added later.<br/>
<br/>
The ones on the Kuwabara look like they were made at the same time when the<br/>
piece was.<br/>
<br/>
Correct me here if I am wrong, but weren't hitsu ana not very popular when<br/>
Nobuiye was active? Ergo they were 'hardly' put in and when they were they<br/>
were quite different in shape from the ones in the Edo period. More<br/>
elongated and oval, in the Edo period they are more "standardized" and all<br/>
look a bit the same.<br/>
<br/>
A forger in the 19th cent like for example one of the Norisuke guys might<br/>
not have thought about this and put in modern looking hitsu ana out of<br/>
habit. The hitsu ana added to the genuine Nobuiye would probably have been<br/>
added after manufacture, but still much earlier than the 19th cent (maybe<br/>
beginning edo period) and would therefore look different.<br/>
<br/>
Or am I being ridiculous here?<br/>

No, that signature is not correct. Look how weak it is cut. The workmanship<br/>
is also not up to Nobuie's standards. The key to this sort of thing is not<br/>
found in books, but in the palm of your hand. I think Fred is spot on, as<br/>

<h3>3 tsuba for contemplation</h3>
by <i>retalt</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1761570607">All, I have 3 tsuba I have been asked to share with you by a friend. <br/>
They are all rather interesting and as he had some questions about their <br/>
origin, I said I would pass them on here to get the collective opinions <br/>
of the group.<br/>
<br/>
1: This he thought may be Toshô. I thought myself, Saotome maybe. It <br/>
appears to be in the style of Nobuiye with a design of the moon, the sun <br/>
and the stars.<br/>
<br/>
85mm x 79mm x 3mm.<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.nihontomessageboard.com/personal/yamato_sword/tsuba_01.jpg">http://www.nihontomessageboard.com/personal/yamato_sword/tsuba_01.jpg</a><br/>
<br/>
2: This one has the distinction of being maybe/apparently a Ninja Tsuba. <br/>
Ok, so I myself don't believe in Ninja, not in the sense that we see <br/>
them in the films and think that if indeed, they existed past being <br/>
runners and murderers, and they used a sword, it would probably have <br/>
been pretty normal in it's shape and fittings, anyway, besides what I <br/>
think LOL.<br/>
<br/>
This is a nice little tsuba, it is obviously made for a katana going by <br/>
the size of the nakago ana, and the crescent moon Hitsu ana ume are very <br/>
nice. We think they may have had shakudo on them, though I was wondering <br/>
if it would have been the black patina that covers silver ??. It's a <br/>
nice little piece.<br/>
<br/>

3: This last one is signed and dated. OMI JÛ TSUNA (?) HIDE. I think it <br/>
is Tsuna, I am pretty sure it is in fact. and dated ( hard to read the <br/>
day but I think it is ) ANSEI YONNEN NIGATSU GOHI. 5th of Feb, 1857. It <br/>
was sold as a possible "Executioners Tsuba". It is quite thick, it's <br/>
dimensions are 76mm x 69mm x 7mm and the Nakago ana is very large <br/>
supposedly making it a " one size fits all" sort of thing with I guess, <br/>
fresh Sekigane added each time.<br/>
<br/>
I have no idea if that is what this was or is, as I said, we are opening <br/>
them up for discussion and would be interested in all  your thoughts.<br/>

<h3>Re: [nihontostudy] 3 tsuba for contemplation</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-299147789">Ah well, I have enjoyed looking at these and really have no opinion on them<br/>
except to say their condition is a real pity as they otherwise look like<br/>
"solid" work.  The only opinion I venture is that on tsuba No. 2 the<br/>
hitsuana are not, in fact, hitsuana.  The shape is wrong IMHO.  I suggest<br/>
that the openings are a design that were later filled in with silver.  The<br/>
black is more likely to be remnants of black lacquer??  Ninja tsuba??  I<br/>
think not.  The ninja (if indeed they existed) were comprehensively<br/>
destroyed by 1600.  I do think this is the best of three put forward.  There<br/>
is just "something" about the beautiful quattrefoil (??) shape...<br/>

2... This is a nice little tsuba, it is obviously made for a katana going by<br/>
the size of the nakago ana, and the crescent moon Hitsu ana ume are very<br/>
nice. We think they may have had shakudo on them, though I was wondering<br/>
if it would have been the black patina that covers silver ??. It's a<br/>
nice little piece.<br/>

<h3>RE: [nihontostudy] Gimei Nobuiye?</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1864096310">Matt and all,<br/>
<br/>
The book on the page you refer to is a Kanie-Nobuie exhibition piece that<br/>
has a number of high quality loose plates like those shown.<br/>
<br/>
The book Arnold referred to is Kyusaku Akiyama's "Nakamura Kakudaifu Nobuie<br/>
Tsuba shu [Collection of Rubbings of Nobuie's Sword Guards Belonging to<br/>
Kakudaifu Nakamura]" from 1926 and I think several reprints. Many of the<br/>
Nobuie guards we see, including Cary's that was written up in the English<br/>
edition Token Bijitsu, are in that book. All illustrations are rubbings that<br/>
Akiyama made, which are actually more useful for study than many of the<br/>
photographs we see. Many of the guards in the book were destroyed during the<br/>
war. While the current scholarship as to the generations and authenticity of<br/>
Nobuie signatures has changed since it's publication, it is still a very<br/>
useful and interesting book.<br/>
<br/>
I have a copy for sale on my website, though it is a bit pricey considering<br/>
it is from  Lundgren's library, and contains notes transcribed in 1964 by<br/>
Robert E. Haynes from the notes he made in 1961 while studying in Japan with<br/>
Dr. Torigoye.<br/>

Hi Arnold, thanks for the response. Did you mean the book that these scans<br/>
came from? <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.jpsword.com/files/kn/nobuiye.html">http://www.jpsword.com/files/kn/nobuiye.html</a><br/>
This webpage is very good for making side by side comparisons with the pix<br/>
on Mr. Weissberg's website. I think I can see the sutble differences in the<br/>
mei now, or perhaps I want to believe I can *grin*. Some more pointers in<br/>
this direction might be good for me all the same. Are there any specifics to<br/>
look for besides the 'softness'?<br/>
<br/>
With regards to the Akiyama tsuba that was found, the mind boggles how it<br/>
wound up on a table at a sword show in the US among a pile of other tsuba!<br/>
<br/>
Matt<br/>
<br/>
Ps. I know I shouldn't ask, but who was the lucky finder?<br/>

<h3>Re: [nihontostudy] Gimei Nobuiye?</h3>
by <i>yamaimojg</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1614236578">Matt,<br/>
I haven't seen the guard in person, but here's something I wrote in response to an off line question a couple of weeks ago.<br/>
<br/>
Jim<br/>
  There were a number of makers working<br/>
  in the Edo period that signed Nobuie, often including their place of<br/>
  residence.  There are guards signed Kaga, Owari, Echizen, Akasaka, etc.<br/>
  Nobuie.  Sometimes the work style of a particular later guard with only a<br/>
  two-character signature can be tied back to one of these.  I don't think<br/>
  that I have ever seen a formal kanteisho written attributing a<br/>
  two-character-signed guard to a specific regional Edo period maker, though.<br/>
  I have seen an NBTHK kanteisho written to "Nobuie (Edo period)" to show that<br/>
  it is not a forgery, but is one of the later makers.  I have seen another<br/>
  written to "betsujin Nobuie," meaning a different person, i.e., not the<br/>
  famous maker(s).  I have also seen good quality, early Edo period tsuba<br/>
  signed Nobuie fail shinsa as forgeries.<br/>
<br/>
  Most of those follow-on makers didn't try (or weren't able) to reproduce the flavor of the<br/>
  iron and rim of the original guards, though.  They use classic designs, but<br/>
  the plate is more like typical early-mid Edo period work.  It became the<br/>
  fashion during the late Edo period to produce copies of the earlier style.<br/>
  Some of these late works are signed by shinshinto sword smiths or Myochin<br/>
  makers and can be quite nice.  The two Norisuke were famous for faking<br/>
  Nobuie, Yamakichibei, Yagyu, etc., guards.  The way that the rim is worked<br/>
  here seems like it's from that period and might even be their work.  There<br/>
  is a definite attempt to recreate the original style, but the result is forced and overdone.  <br/>
<br/>
   Photos are no substitute for seeing a piece in<br/>
  person.  I can't see the signature very well in the photo, but the quality<br/>
  of the metal and workmanship are harder to fake than a signature.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  Gimei Nobuiye?<br/>
<br/>
  my question is how can you tell?<br/>
  It looks awfully similar to the ones in the books!<br/>
<br/>
  And if it is indeed gimei, how old is it do we think?<br/>
