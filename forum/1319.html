on request.<br/>
 <br/>

 <br/>

rare now. Over 400 items listed in 423 pages. Lots of juyo quality<br/>
stuff, making this a super reference book. Very good copy with very good<br/>
dustjacket. Some slight fading to the spine (dj) and some very small<br/>

Rare reference book. Very good condition, with only one very small tear<br/>
to the back of the dustjacket and priceclipped. Comes with protective<br/>
brodart cover for the dj. Asking $200<br/>
 <br/>
3. The Hartman Collection of Japanese metalwork by Christie's, Mason and<br/>
Woods Ltd 1976. Published as a hardback with no dustjacket this book is<br/>
in very good condition also. Only slight fading to the spine, otherwise<br/>
perfect. Comes with original errata and list of estimates (loose).<br/>
Unfortunately no list of prices realised. A definate must have for any<br/>
serious tsuba or kodogu collector, the collection of tsuba within is<br/>
simply stunning. Asking $150<br/>
 <br/>
4. Masterpieces of the R. B. Caldwell collection of Japanese Sword<br/>
Fittings by Patrick Syz 1994. Hardback. One very tiny crease to the top<br/>
of the dustjacket (hardly noticeable), otherwise absolutely mint. Comes<br/>

scratches to the boards and minor bumping in the corners. Asking $125<br/>
 <br/>
6. Nippon-To The Japanese Sword by Inami Hakusui 1948. Hardback. An<br/>
absolute Classic, this was the first English reference book written by a<br/>
noted Japanese expert. In super condition, this book is a treasure to<br/>
behold. One small tear to the dustjacket next to the spine only. No<br/>
fading, no creases, nothing. The book looks like it was published<br/>
yesterday ! Interesting little vintage pamphlet from the Japan Sword Co<br/>
selling kitchen knives inside. Comes with protective brodart cover for<br/>
the dj. Asking $250<br/>
 <br/>
7. Early Japanese Sword Guards; Sukashi Tsuba, by Masayuki Sasano 1972.<br/>
Hardback. Classic reference book on sukashi tsuba this usually retails<br/>
in the $225 - 300 range depending on condition. Hoever this example is<br/>
ex libris and has the usual library stamps inside. When it was in the<br/>
library the dustjacket was stuck to the inside of the book(!). This has<br/>
since been remedied and the dustjacket is now loose and comes in a<br/>
protective brodart cover but you can still see where it used to be stuck<br/>
on. Otherwise in good - very good condition. Asking $175 <br/>
 <br/>

Sotheby's 1996. Wonderful hardback auction catalog in mint condition.<br/>

catalog full of tsuba and other sword fittings, very lavishly<br/>

is recommended for any kodogu lover. Comes with protective brodart cover<br/>
for the dj. Asking $125<br/>
 <br/>
11. Tsuba II: Returned Tsuba from Europe, by Inami Tomihiko. Hardback.<br/>
This is the second of a set of two describing various tsuba that were<br/>
returned from Germany and Europe to Japan. Both are very hard to find.<br/>
An interesting book with 200 tsuba illustrated in this volume, most in<br/>
b/w but also quite a few in color. Be warned this book is in Japanese<br/>
though! Extremely good condition all round. Comes with protective<br/>
brodart cover for the dj. Asking $100<br/>
 <br/>
12. Illustrated catalogues of Tokyo National Museum Sword guard(s) by<br/>
Tokyo National Museum, 1979. Hardback. Another scarce / rare book<br/>
illustrating 542 tsubas in the Tokyo National Museum.  Black and white<br/>
pictures unfortunately, but still a must have reference for any serious<br/>
tsuba collector. I saw one copy in tatty condition sell on ebay last<br/>
year for something like $300 (!). This copy is in very good to fine<br/>
condition. Comes with protective brodart cover for the dj. Asking $175<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
Right and now on to the sword that I have for sale. This Nambokucho<br/>
(14th century) sword was purchased last year from Aoi Arts in Japan. It<br/>
comes with fairly recent NBTHK Tokubetsu Hozon papers, a professional<br/>
oshigata done at Aoi Arts and their own menu shaped certificate<br/>
describing the sword and stating that it was then valued at 1,2 million<br/>
yen. The sword is in a shirasaya, no koshirae and is in excellent<br/>
polish. I was toying with the idea of submitting it to Juyo Shinsa, but<br/>
have so far not got round to it. I don't know if it would stand a chance<br/>
of going Juyo, but I think that it should be submitted if only just for<br/>
the experience which would be very educational in my opinion. It is<br/>
attributed to the Nakajima Rai school which seems to be pretty darn<br/>
rare. At least this is the only one I have ever seen. Below is the info<br/>
exactly as on the Aoi Arts certificate.<br/>
 <br/>
'We certify the following Katana is genuine. Detail, Katana: the NBTHK<br/>
Tokubetsu-hozon token. <br/>
Signature: Unsigned, attributed to Nakajima-Rai. The blade is polished,<br/>
in a shirasaya.<br/>
Blade length: 62.7 cm or 24.69 inches.<br/>
Sori: 1.0 cm or 0.39 inch.<br/>
Width at the hamachi: 2.98cm or 1.17 inches.<br/>
Width at the yokote: 2.11 cm or 0.83 inch.<br/>
Thickness at the hamachi: 0.74 cm or 0.29 inch.<br/>
Era: Nambokucho-period. 14th century. <br/>
 <br/>
Shape: A shinogi-zukuri katana. Broadish blade has plenty thickness and<br/>
the point is O-kissaki.<br/>
Jitetsu: Small mokume is combined with small itame-hada. Fine jitetsu<br/>
bears delicate jinie.<br/>
Hamon: Nie-deki. Naka-suguha hamon goes with ashi, yo, kinsuji and<br/>
sunagashi.<br/>
Boshi: Niju-ba turns back roundly on the front. <br/>
 <br/>
A glance at this sword shows that clearly Rai School tradition.<br/>
Acceptable o-hada appears about six inches above the hamachi. Superb<br/>
jitetsu and sensitive works on the ha are the point of appreciation.<br/>
1,200,000 Yen.' <br/>
 <br/>
I still have the original Aoi Arts pictures that can be sent on request.<br/>
Asking $12,500. <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
Thanks for taking the time to read all this and let me know if I can be<br/>
of any further help or if any of you want pix or more detailed<br/>
descriptions. <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:matthew@...">matthew@...</a> <br/>

I would want your #11, I've been looking for it for some time, but your<br/>
prices! Enough to make a predatory bookseller blush! Even the last copy Mike<br/>
Y. (historian333) sold on eBay only went for $70 or so. (I missed seeing the<br/>
auction until it was over.)<br/>
<br/>
As someone who, as of today, officially will be making my living selling<br/>
books, I am comforted by your prices - I have many of the same titles - and<br/>
do hope you get them, it bodes well for my business if you do.<br/>
<br/>
Let me know if there is something we can work out, even a trade for<br/>
something you are looking for ...<br/>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1504344527">Hi Craig, <br/>
 <br/>
The prices reflect the fact that most books are in near mint condition,<br/>
I am extremely picky when it comes to my books, and can't stand damaged<br/>
ones and prefer to pay a premium for perfect examples. In practice this<br/>
is not always possible but I do try......  However I think you will find<br/>
that most of these prices are still lower than what is common on the<br/>
net. Try Satcho, Jinsoo or Mr. Weissberg for example. That being said<br/>
offers are always considered, I am pretty difficult to insult as far as<br/>
that goes. <br/>
 <br/>
I can let the book you want go for $85 including wordwide shipping. That<br/>
works out at the same as the ebay one if you add on the shipping to<br/>
that. And ofcourse since I am in the Netherlands your weak dollar is not<br/>
helping much either :-)<br/>

You're right, now that I look at it, it should probably sell for $50, but I<br/>
opened my mouth, and my single copy is now sold.<br/>
<br/>
I was probably thinking of:<br/>
<br/>
Dunn, Roger [Editor]. Token Taikai. San Francisco: Northern California<br/>
Japanese Sword Club, 1976. First edition. Transcripts of 11 lectures<br/>
presented at the Token Taikai in San Francisco in 1976, plus three other<br/>
papers not presented but included to augment the lecture topics. Includes<br/>
papers on armor, swords, sword fittings and history by noted authors John<br/>
Yumoto, Dr. Benjamin H. Hazard, Thomas Buttweiler, Dean Hartley, K. K.<br/>
Chappelear, Robert Haynes and K. Torigoye.<br/>
[This copy noted in red ink on the Introduction page as Book Number "27."<br/>
Unknown how many copies were printed.] Very Good in Wraps<br/>
<br/>
Which I do have two copies of @ $35, not $25. It's a bitch getting older ...<br/>

you subscribe to the first law of the Faranghi ?<br/>
It says.......... " there is no shame in being expensive " <br/>
the second law says........ " the stupidity of other species is not <br/>
the fault of the Faranghis "<br/>
<br/>
that 11 lectures book in hard cover for 35 beans ?  It's an excellent <br/>
book even at twice your asking price.<br/>
<br/>
By the way, I have a copy of the " meibutsu " 79  catalog with fold <br/>
out  oshigata for sale at 50 + 5.00 shipping.   As you can deduce, i <br/>
do follow the laws of the Faranghis when selling .........  =)<br/>
