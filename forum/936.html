<h3>Haynes catalogs</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-84983042">Hey guys,<br/>
<br/>
I just got a chance to peruse the set of Haynes catalogs I ordered from <br/>
Mr. Helm (thanks again Tom!).<br/>
<br/>
There appears to be a lot of good info in them.  One thing I was curious <br/>
about was the dating in them - at<br/>
first glance it looks like perhaps Mr. Haynes was trying to follow <br/>
Sasano's "telescoped" dating for fittings.<br/>
Is this really what's going on, or are there really that many kamakura <br/>
era tsuba, kogai, menuki, etc, out there...<br/>
(I think Jim had implied earlier that Sasano's students are busily <br/>
standing back from his dating scale now,<br/>
and...)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
<br/>

Bob tends to date some things fairly early compared to common current (or past) Japanese standards.  His approach is probably closest to Sasano's.<br/>
<br/>
Just an anecdote that comes to mind...  an experience Bob has mentioned a couple of times was a visit with Dr. Torigoye to a shrine in an area of Japan with a lot of old mound (Kofun) burials.  In addition to the swords that had been donated, the shrine had a box of Kofun jidai fittings that had turned up over the years.  Included among these was a kogai that was presumably contemporary with this material.  This was at a time when kogai were considered to be a late invention.  Today there are kogai that are accepted as Heian to Kamakura period.  Dating of early fittings still needs a lot of work.<br/>
