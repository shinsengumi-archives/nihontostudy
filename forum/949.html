Yes, kozuka can refer to the blade (kogatana) and "handle" together as a unit, or to the fitting alone.  I don't think that kozuka were intended to be used as weapons.  They were utility knives as you describe.  Many Muromachi period functional katana were mounted without kozuka or kogai.  It's generally the fancier examples that have a kogai or kogai and kozuka together on the saya (or perhaps it's only the fancier ones that survived).  A kozuka-only mount was usually found on a wakizashi, and even on utilitarian ones.  I have personally never seen an original katana koshirae mounted with only a kozuka or an illustration of one like that.  Does anyone have an example to show?<br/>
