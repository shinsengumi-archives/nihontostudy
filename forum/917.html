<br/>
I think you are correct on both calls.  First looks like a Bushu Ito and the second a cut down Katchushi.  The hitsu were usually put in later.  I have seen some of these large Kozuka hitsu in Momoyama and early Edo tsuba.<br/>

  I have a couple of tsuba I was wondering if the list would help me <br/>

  First one:<br/>

  (nice heavy tsuba, 3 1/8")<br/>
  I think Bizen Shoami or some school related to Bushu or Ito (I think <br/>
  late Edo).<br/>
  Any other ideas?<br/>
<br/>
  Second one:<br/>

  (very thin, slightly under 3". purplish iron with remnants of lacquer <br/>

  I think Ko-Katchushi. pre-Edo to Momoyama.<br/>
  Is the kozuka ana original? It is huge...<br/>

The first looks like a typical Kyo Shoami.  Ito guards are usually more naturalistically carved with more detail and sharper edges, and the iron is a bit smoother textured.  I find Bizen Shoami to be hard to pin down sometimes, but most examples seem to be more heavily decorated with inlay.  Another possibility is Kinai.  They did occasionally do carving that looks a lot like Kyo Shoami and they sometimes added inlay metal like that.  Their metal usually has a black finish and the seppa dai tend to be narrower.  They also signed their work more frequently than did the Kyo Shoami.  Given the alternatives, the design, carving, decoration and metal seem most likely Kyo Shoami.<br/>
<br/>
The older guard almost looks Saotome, but it's at least in the Katchushi vein.  Given the raised rim and the position of the sukashi, I don't see any sign of it having been cut down.  Early pieces sometimes have very eccentric hitsuana.  The unusually large openings were probably used with o-kozuka or o-kogai.  There seem to be more iron tsuba with large ana around today than there are the kozuka or kogai they were mounted with at one time.  <br/>
<br/>
I suspect that in this case the hitsuana, or at least that the large one, are original or at least the same age as the openwork design.  Look at how the sukashi pattern is pushed much closer to the rim on the side with the large opening vs. the side with the small one.  If the original design had no hitsuana, why create that asymmetry in the sukashi pattern?  It would be unbalanced even with a "normal" sized kozuka ana, but the sukashi pattern is designed with just enough room for each ana while keeping the impression of a reasonably balanced design.  From what I can see in the photo, I'd guess that it's late Muromachi or possibly a bit older.<br/>

Thanks very much for the comments!<br/>
Jim, I appreciate you taking the time to provide the insight on the <br/>
early guard.<br/>
<br/>
The pine tree guard is very unusual (to me). Unfortunately, the <br/>
photographs don't show it very well. It is primitive, but bold. I <br/>
did a scan that captured its "spirit" much better:<br/>

Why do you call this shiiremono? The quality looks a lot<br/>
better than what I've seen of this shiiremono genre?<br/>
What details of the tsuba say it's shiiremono?<br/>
