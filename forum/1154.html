<h3>Brinkley available on line</h3>

I've been looking through volume one and the quality of the scans is quite good.  Anyone who has been talking about making books available on line should check it out for the navigation experience.  Of course the content is classic, too.  Be aware that every page is scanned, even blank ones, so it takes a bit of clicking to get to the beginning of the text... about 19 pages in.<br/>

Once in a while, you can find Cpt. Brinkley's volumes  in e-bay.<br/>
I got my set there, different editions but the text/illustrations are <br/>
the same .<br/>
It is easier to leaf through the actual books than to click, scroll, <br/>
click, scroll again und again.........<br/>
just my personal experience, of course.<br/>

Of course Brinkley is readily available in paper.  I posted it because the subject matter is somewhat topical, but more because it is about as good a presentation of the "scanned page" approach as I've seen.  For those thinking about making texts available on line, it's worth checking this out.  I agree with you that it is not a very usable way to present the material.  I could suffer through it if it was the only way to access a text, but better methods should be used if at all possible.<br/>

Cheers Jim, this is cool<br/>
