<h3>Sadanobu or Teimei</h3>
by <i>retalt</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1362670835">Here is an interesting tsuba. Signed Kishu Ju Sadanobu/Teimei. I always <br/>
wonder about the reading of this mei. Is one way more correct than the <br/>
other ? or are they both right ? ( I also here Sadanaga from time to <br/>
time ). I see Nihonto Koza says Sadanobu, I have heard that the Japanese <br/>
refer to him as Teimei.<br/>
<br/>
As to the theme, does anyone have an idea what this is ?. Could it be <br/>
either walkwaysor maybe an Ideogram of some kind. ?.<br/>

<h3>RE: [nihontostudy] Sadanobu or Teimei</h3>
by <i>robsongord</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-534465371">Hi Rich,<br/>
<br/>
Not sure what the motif is, but as for the way names are read, typically the<br/>
kunyomi is used or the Japanese pronunciation. However, even sword-smiths<br/>
are given onyomi or Sino-Japanese nicknames. Perhaps the most famous is<br/>
Nagayoshi, who is typically called Chogi. There is also Hiroyoshi, whose<br/>
nickname is Hiroga. Teimei may be a Japanese nickname for Sadanobu. I am<br/>
pretty sure you would read his signature using the kunyomi. On the other<br/>
hand, there are lots of fittings makers whose name is read using the onyomi<br/>
-- Tomei, Somin, all the Goto guys. Even the Omori guys' names are<br/>
pronounced here in Japan using the onyomi. I hope this is sufficiently<br/>
confusing.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-928844552">Kishu no Ju Sadanaga aka Teimei.  I believe the theme may be a foot <br/>
bridge although traditionally they have five planks if memory serves.<br/>
<br/>
see Haynes 07752.0 pp 1559-1560 -- A group of artists who all signed, <br/>
Kishu ju Sadanaga.  There were at least four or five generations.  <br/>
They seem to have come from the early Edo Hoan school.  Some read <br/>
this name as Teimei.  Furukawa catalog pl. 27 #153.<br/>
