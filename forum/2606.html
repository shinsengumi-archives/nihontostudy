Iron tsuba , katana size  with brass/copper inlay outlining the <br/>
flower and leaves. There also appears to have a thin layer of " <br/>
blackish " color metallic material covering the whole tsuba flat <br/>
surface ( into which the slots are cut into the iron to fit the brass <br/>
wire inlay ), this gives a " reflective silvery sheen " to the whole <br/>
tsuba when tilt and view at an angle. You all can see the " covering <br/>
layer " better at the actual auction page .<br/>

Agreed that the sukashi design looks like Kyo-Shoami, but that type would usually be decorated with nunome zogan.  Given the type of "true inlay" on your guard it would probably be attributed to Heianjo.  Your description of a silvery sheen made me think of fire scale, but the close up photos show a heavy layer of wax on the surface.  If it still looks metallic in person, it may be scale.<br/>
<br/>
There is no sahari there, despite the auction description.  I see only brass.<br/>
<br/>
There are some types of guard that are found as iron sukashi only, along with other versions of the same sukashi ground decorated with Shoami-style nunome zogan and yet other examples of the same type of plate decorated with Heianjo-style hira zogan.  I suspect that these were not the products of separate "schools" but rather different levels of trim that could be ordered according to taste and budget.  The decoration might have been done "in house" or subcontracted out to specialists.<br/>
