Thought ko-Hagi plate was not much different than later Choshu work but that the design was made repeated on both sides--front of flower on one side; front of flower on reverse--whereas later Choshu work would be more realistic--front of flower on one side; back of flower on reverse.  Not sure where I read that.  I've always thought the Choshu tsuba I use on my letterhead and meishi was ko-Hagi because of this characteristic.  <br/>

I've read several tellings of this anecdote, but the easiest for me to find is from Haynes and Torigoye's Tsuba an Aesthetic Study:<br/>
<br/>
"The term Ko-Hagi is in reality a misnomer.  Its origin will be found in a statement made by the late Morishiro concerning a rubbing of a tsuba in his collection.  Akiyama noted on the oshigata that the tsuba was probably like old Choshu work (Ko-Hagi saku).  From this notation it was deduced that this style of tsuba was actually made in Choshu and was the old style of work from that province.  Inamura Choga took this term from Morishiro and introduced it to the public as the school of Ko-Hagi tsuba.  The truth is, the tsuba in this style were made in Kyoto and are the product of the Kyo-sukashi school."<br/>
<br/>
Dr. Torigoye was a student of Akiyama.<br/>

    Some of them can have a bit of a rough-textured surface, but most are pretty much like Kyo-sukashi guards.  Masame visible on the rim... can't say I recall seeing that on Ko-Hagi.  <br/>

Not what I think of as a "classic" Ko-Hagi design, but it might be included in that style.  It looks like it is very badly corroded, so it's hard to say much.  I think that the heavy erosion is why you're able to see the grain of the metal in the rim. <br/>
<br/>
Here's a tiny url link to Milt's photo:<br/>

You'll still have to log in to the site to view it, but then it'll take you straight to the large photo.<br/>
<br/>
Any other ideas?<br/>

I would agree, not a classic ko-Hagi IMHO, looks awfully<br/>
rusted/corroded which basically makes it an unknown as far<br/>
as any surface detail/texture is concerned.<br/>
