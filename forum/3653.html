  Very sad news.  The very first book I ever found in English on Japanese swords was written by him.<br/>
<br/>
  The Japanese sword community has lost a leader.<br/>

    Thank you for the report.  Mr Robinson and his publications were a highly valuable source of pre-electronic information on Nihonto.  He is much admired and highly respected, and was indeed a real scholar.  Sincere condolences to his family and colleagues.<br/>

      I am sorry to have to report the death of Basil Robinson on December 29, he was 93. In the early 60s I took blades to the V&A museum to be vetted and he was always unfailingly polite about the most outrageous rubbish that I showed him, also I think most collectors of my age were started on the slippery slope of sword collecting by his 'Arts of the Japanese Sword'.<br/>

<br/>
Happy New Year. Does anyone out there know Alan Rushing? He joined the <br/>
NTHK in SF during the summer, but did not put down the state and zip <br/>
code in his address. He gave the city as Fairfield, which I would think <br/>
is the place north of SF. Please have him contact me off list if <br/>
someone can get in touch with him.<br/>
