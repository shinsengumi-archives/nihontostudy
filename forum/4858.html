<div id="ygrps-yiv-1231060189">Hi all - <br/>
<br/>
Besides packing a nice selection of super swords for super prices for my table -- well, maybe I'm overly optimistic a little -- I also lugged what seemed like a ton of books to the car that will be on my table. (Raising funds to pay off sword related debts.)<br/>
<br/>
Will have my remaining copies of our 2007 KTK Tokyo exhibition catalogue for sale (nothing but compliments by those who have purchased this fine printing). Also have a copy of Nihonto Zuikan Koto-hen, a set of Shinshinto Taikan, Tsuba Taikan (reprint), Hakusui Inami's Nihonto; The Japanese Sword and a copy of Yumei Koto Taikan. Boy, these are heavy books! I don't know how the bookdealers can handle these critters show after show! <br/>
<br/>
Hope to see you there, good Lord willing. <br/>

<br/>
Just a short note before heading down the road to Tampa. Besides a few swords and fittings, I'm bringing most of the books I bought several months ago. I never did follow-up on peddling these via Ebay. If you're looking for any books, stop by and have a look. Books are HEAVY so this is a chance to save shipping/insurance plus...I sure don't look forward to lugging them back home again! Check out my table. I take (good) checks and of course, cash! Seriously, there are some good titles that I'll have there. <br/>
