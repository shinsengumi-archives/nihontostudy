<h3>SAMURAI SWORDS BANNED IN THE REPUBLIC OF IRELAND</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1969570017">A short time ago I reported the Irish police as having seized 7,000 swords. <br/>
I have just found this discussion:<br/>

-------------------------------<br/>
Talks about potential sword ban started  in December 2007 after another high <br/>
profile attack involving a 'samurai sword'. It is known that Department of <br/>
Justice had been in contact with local martial arts organisations (Iaido <br/>
Association of Ireland is particular) is order to avoid unnecessary <br/>
restrictions for martial arts practitioneers and authentic sword collectors. <br/>
In the light of recent global trends to regulate possession and <br/>
transportation of 'samurai' swords (which sometimes comes in quite <br/>
narrow-minded forms) the new Irish legislation appears to be reasonable, <br/>
especially taking into account the (more than modest) size of the local <br/>
sword scene. Mirroring the UK sword ban which was introduced in April 2008 <br/>
as one of the questionable measures to fight 'knife crime', authentic <br/>
hand-made Japanese swords (Nihonto) are exempt (however I couldn't yet find <br/>
any reference to whether sports equipment such as iaito and shinken is to be <br/>
banned or not).<br/>
<br/>
The real concern is the practical side of the legislation and the way it's <br/>
going to be implemented. There's been numerous occasions in UK since <br/>
introduction of the sword ban when law-abiding collectors had trouble <br/>
importing antique swords. It's perfectly understandable due to the fact that <br/>
in order for Customs to make sure that it's legal to import a sword, some <br/>
sort of cerfificate required proving its age and provenance. And the most <br/>
common cert of this kind (if any) is the NBTHK paper hand-written in <br/>
Japanese. No wonder Customs officers, sorting office workers and law <br/>
enforcement authorities would not be able to take it as a supportive <br/>
documentation without difficult (and costly) translation.And this is the <br/>
neigbouring UK which is much more accustomed to importing/exporting Japanese <br/>
collectible weapons than Irish. How many Customs officers and An Post <br/>
employees were instructed about differences between replica and authentic <br/>
Japanese swords or even have seen ones? Will they be collector-friendly or <br/>
take an eBay approach and stop any import of 'illegal samurai-like swords' <br/>
unless (with immense trouble) proven otherwise? If temporarily or <br/>
permanently seized, will real Nihonto be given a proper care?<br/>
<br/>
There is no doubt that circulation of cheap and dangerous replica had to be <br/>
stopped, even with the level or crime involving samurai swords being <br/>
ridiculously low in comparison to the usage of widely available home <br/>
utensils.But will the fair treatment of martial arts practitioners and sword <br/>
collectors be guaranteed? Time will tell.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1318380958">Hello:<br/>
 <br/>
Well..what else do hey have to do as far as banning weapons? They already  <br/>
got the firearms..so swords and knives are next.<br/>
 <br/>
Still I have sent quite a few swords to Ireland as well as Great Britain  <br/>
and I have never had a problem with Customs in either country, but these were <br/>
 not the $99.00 Specials either. Then again they were not made in Japan but <br/>
they  are hand made...geeze...when will the gubberments of there world <br/>
realize that  it's the criminals they need to get off the streets and leave the <br/>
decent folks  alone for a change?<br/>
