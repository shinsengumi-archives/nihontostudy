<h3>Mei Titles</h3>
by <i>retalt</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-31486761">All. when looking through my books, I was reading into titles, such as<br/>
Kami, Daijo^, Suke etc. and in Hawleys ( I never know whether to trust<br/>
this book or not ) it lists in order of importance, Kami, then Daijo^,<br/>
then runs Jo^ and Suke as evens. Then in Robinson's The Arts of the<br/>
Japanese Sword, he places the emphasis of importance starting at Kami,<br/>
then Suku and Daijo^ are next followed up with Jo^.<br/>
<br/>
Is there a rule for this, are they all as important as each other at the<br/>
end of the day, which is correct if either and if not, the what ?.<br/>
<br/>
cheers in advance.<br/>
