<h3>(Higo) Nishigaki Kanshiro Question</h3>

<br/>
I have placed several photos in my listfolder 'Curran'. They are of <br/>
a tsuba that I recently acquired in trade. It is in Sasano's 'Early <br/>
Japanese Sword Guards' as tsuba #208. Sasano has attributed his <br/>
tsuba to the 3rd generation Kanshiro.<br/>
<br/>
I do not know much about distinguishing between the different <br/>
generations of Kanshiro work, and would like to invite open <br/>
discussion of this tsuba. I am curious whether it is an earlier or a <br/>
later work and would like to pin it down to within 2 generations.<br/>
<br/>
The tsuba is large with a slight acorn shape to it, meaning that it <br/>
is slightly asymetric with the widest point being at the hips.<br/>
Width there is about 81mm and height is 85 mm.<br/>
   The shakudo inserts are long, nice shakudo, and asymetrically set <br/>
with the right hand one set a few mm higher.<br/>
<br/>
Thickness is about 3.75 mm at the mimi to about 4mm at the seppa-dai.<br/>
The tsuba is very precise and finished.<br/>
    Thank you in advance,<br/>
<br/>
