<h3>tanto mei help</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1330158552">Hi all - <br/>
<br/>
Trying to send this to all my groups, so let's see if the link to Yahoo photos works. It is my album Ron STL under Yahoo photos. It is also an album: (sworddad) 2004 5/15 in another Yahoo photos album. (I'm still confused as to why I'm under two locations.) <br/>
<br/>
The mei shown is on what appears an early tanto, 25.2 cm, about 1-1.5 mm uchizori, mitsumune. At first I blew-off the mei as gimei to: Rai Kunitoshi or Kuniyuki. However, the tanto does seem to fit the era of Rai work. Looking at it again today I'm starting to wonder if this might be something totally different. The third character could very easily be accepted at "saku" which would then mean that the first character I'm calling "Rai" might be something else similar in form to "Rai." There definitely is a horizontal stroke at the ana. You can see just the end of it to the left of the hole. One similar character I found in O'Neil is #343 (radical 119) which could be read Yone, bei, mai, kome, mitsu...but I can not come up with any smith using this first character in his name. Perhaps I'm groping here, wishful thinking that it is not a gimei Rai-something, but maybe one of you guys with a command of the language will know something I do not know. (Wouldn't take much!) <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, see if this link works or, just go to the Yahoo photos and look for my album. <br/>
