<h3>Kanenobu and deleted kanji</h3>
by <i>jswords03</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1425819106">Dear All<br/>
<br/>
I have a special order Gendaito by Kanenobu.  This is the Gendaito smith <br/>
that became a intangible cultural asset of Gifu prefecture in 1973. It <br/>
turns out that part of the kanji, on the right hand side of the ura side <br/>
of the nakago, have been deleted.<br/>
<br/>
The left hand side I think translates as<br/>
<br/>
"This blade was presented to the person, who's name has been deleted, <br/>
for his sincere assistance in the shipping department at the the <br/>
Hankengoku Educational Institution located by the Kizugawa (Kizu River) <br/>
in Kyoto, in Greater Japan. "<br/>
<br/>
This is with help from Harry Watson (thanks) but any mistakes are all my <br/>
doing. <br/>
<br/>
On the right hand side of the ura all that is left is something like<br/>
<br/>
"This blade was presented to someone of rank that could be called His <br/>
Majesty"<br/>
<br/>
<>Many of the kanji have been erased/deleted.<br/>
<br/>
You can see images of the nakago and the kanji that I have identified at<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<>Now my questions are<br/>
<br/>
1. Does any one know anything about this Hankengoku Educational Institution?<br/>
<br/>
2. Is there enough information still on the nakago to identify who the <br/>
blade was presented to?<br/>
<br/>
3. Is there a way to raise the deleted kanji?<br/>
<br/>
            Like they do one guns with the serial numbers filed off!<br/>
<br/>
  <><br/>
Thanks for any help.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
