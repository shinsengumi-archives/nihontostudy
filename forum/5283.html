<div id="ygrps-yiv-1507712114">Freeman's Auction of Philadelphia, etc is having a major auction<br/>
on March 16-17 of Japanese and Oriental arts. Included is a <br/>
large collection of over 100 pieces of lacquer, swords, and other<br/>
items.<br/>

<br/>
They are an international auction company; taking online bids (ending<br/>
before regular bidding); phone bids, gallery bids. This is not ebay -<br/>
read their procedures, etc on the website. I've dealt with them<br/>
before and they are first rate. <br/>
<br/>
The entire auction catalog will be online approx March 5 or 6 with<br/>
photos of all items. The mail catalog will be available soon. Check them<br/>
out and register early to bid. They buy and sell internationally, with<br/>
a lot of Japanese buyers by phone.<br/>
