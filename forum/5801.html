<h3>Owari sukashi tsuba</h3>
by <i>retalt</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-77797378">(In case the original does not come though)<br/>
<br/>
Hi all, I recently purchased this Momoyama Owari sukashi I have had my <br/>
eye on for a while. Fairly classic design and at 81mm x 80mm x 5.5mm it <br/>
is a nice size. One of the traits here that I find most interesting is <br/>
the mimi, and the obvious fold line that appears in it (it covers about <br/>
30% of the mimi). it is almost like the tsuba was made from a two plate <br/>
construction, though I am not suggesting that at all. I assume the <br/>
original plate was forged, then folded and forged again before shaping.<br/>
<br/>
I cannot nay that I have seen this so clearly before in an Owari guard <br/>
before ( I will also note that I got it to jump out a bit with some <br/>
clever lighting etc) and wondered if it was a normal trait in Owari works.<br/>
<br/>
I really love the iron on this guard, its been well forged and is in <br/>
really good condition.<br/>
<br/>

I don't know about typical, but I shot an owari piece for the KTK's 2010 <br/>

I took a look at the 2010 KTK publication. That was an Owari tsuba and it mentions 3-fold forging.  Maybe upon closer inspection, Rich's tsuba might also reveal the 3-fold forging instead of simply a folded over forging. <br/>

Hi all, I recently purchased this Momoyama Owari sukashi I have had my <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
eye on for a while. Fairly classic design and at 81mm x 80mm x 5.5mm it <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
is a nice size. One of the traits here that I find most interesting is <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
the mimi, and the obvious fold line that appears in it (it covers about <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
30% of the mimi). it is almost like the tsuba was made from a two plate <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
construction, though I am not suggesting that at all. I assume the <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
original plate was forged, then folded and forged again before shaping.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I cannot nay that I have seen this so clearly before in an Owari guard <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
before ( I will also note that I got it to jump out a bit with some <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
clever lighting etc) and wondered if it was a normal trait in Owari works.<br/>

I really love the iron on this guard, its been well forged and is in <br/>

really good condition.<br/>

      thanks for replying Jim, interesting thoughts. I do not see this as a <br/>
<br/>
flaw personally, and as I noted, my photo does seem to accentuate the <br/>
<br/>
effect. This is a pic from the dealer I bought it from, which is <br/>
<br/>
probably closer to the real look in hand I think.<br/>

and opted for a Joushin Futokoromono and I have been kicking myself ever <br/>

I am brining it over to Sydney so you can have a look if you come.<br/>
