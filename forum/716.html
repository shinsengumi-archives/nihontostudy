<h3>For Tsuba Lovers</h3>
by <i>tsubahunter</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1642017136">I asked for a translation of the tsuba in my folder Lou's Stuff.  I thank <br/>
those that took a look.  Well, a friend translated it to read Yama-shiro Kuni <br/>
Fushi-mi ju Kan-ie'.  So what I have to ask is this the real thing?  It was at a <br/>
local antique shop for over a year before I picked it up for a very low price. <br/>
 It was hidden in an over packed display case from a dealer in other types of <br/>
oriental art.  The theme and work seems to match the works shown on Jinsoo's <br/>
site.  <A HREF="<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://nihontobook.homestead.com/files/kn/kaneiye.html"">http://nihontobook.homestead.com/files/kn/kaneiye.html"</a>><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://nihontobook.homestead.com/files/kn/kaneiye.html</A">http://nihontobook.homestead.com/files/kn/kaneiye.html</A</a>><br/>
The rim is soft metal.  I assume this was put on due to damage to the iron.  <br/>
Does this decrease the value of the piece, and will it cause the piece to fail <br/>
shinza?  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hey, it would go nicely with the two that I have!<br/>
<br/>
I put one on the Sadamune, and the other on the Masamune.  :-).<br/>

(OK, kidding aside, the scoop is that you're probably not going to find<br/>
an authentic one signed like this... there was a group in Saga who<br/>
signed like this claiming lineage to Kaneie, but I gather everyone<br/>
thought they were rather full of it for doing so. They signed in the<br/>
same manner, though they were in Hizen. These exist I think in a void<br/>
between gimei and the real deal. Maybe it's like some dude downtown<br/>
claiming Picasso was his great-great grandfather, so choosing to paint<br/>
"picasso" style and signing "picasso." While those are not technically<br/>
forgeries, they're also not the real thing, but they are those dude's<br/>
paintings. I have one of the Saga group pieces (as do probably many<br/>
people), and I also have one that would seem to be an homage piece, not<br/>
signed Kaneie but signed Yamashiro Kuni ... Masa[X] which is not quite<br/>
legible... I am sending it to Cary for research.... disclaimer: I know<br/>
less about tsuba than I do about swords, correction is gladly taken as<br/>
learning information, I am passing on what I have read/listened to<br/>
intently, if there are errors in that it is because I have inserted<br/>
them out of ignorance.)</div>
