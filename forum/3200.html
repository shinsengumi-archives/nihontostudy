  I would imagine it is referring to the aesthetics of the tea ceremony, which under Toyotomi's patronage and Sen no Rikkyu's execution (no pun intended), was at the height of popularity during the Momoyama era....<br/>

Look up ca. Momoyama tea ceramics in Raku, Shino, Oribe, Iga, Seto, Mino, Shigaraki, etc., styles.  There's a lot more to tea taste than that, but it will be a start.<br/>
<br/>
I think that your idea about debris might have come from terms like gomoku zogan used to describe late, low quality, "random" decoration sometimes retrofitted to older plates.  I don't think that there was any intention to actually depict debris or puddles.  Tea leaves -- no.  That style of tea is actually a bright green, fine powder, btw.<br/>
<br/>
I don't see anything Tenbo about the plate, but to your earlier question, there are some Tenbo guards with Yamashiro ju signatures, so presumably there was a relationship with Kyoto at some point.  Who knows where the many poor quality mu-mei ones from later in the Edo period were made.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I wonder if this tsuba fulfills the "wabi sabi" and "tea taste" criterion???<br/>

<br/>
It is a tsuba from a handachi in very lovely, subdued koshirae - dark ishime<br/>
lacquer with black fuchigashira and an iron plate instead of same.  The plate<br/>
has a nunome zogan dragon down each side of the tsuka.  I would welcome opinions<br/>
on the mumei tsuba.  Here and there on the surface one can see tiny blobs of<br/>
gold.  I think they represent dew drops on the "rotted wood" of the iron surface<br/>
of the tsuba.  I apologise for the poor quality of the image.  I took it years<br/>
ago with a "first edition" digital camera.  I should do it again - and both<br/>
sides - however, I just wanted to get things going here.  I think the tsuba is<br/>
Tosa Myochin but - what do I know!!!  I based this opinion on the tagane style<br/>
on the seppa dai that I once read was a characteristic of Tosa Myochin...<br/>
<br/>
Best regards,<br/>
