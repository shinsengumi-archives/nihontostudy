<h3>New collector needs help in Tucson AZ</h3>
by <i>musashibobenkei</i>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1951993850">Please pardon the cross-posting, most of you will probably get (at most)<br/>
three copies of this.<br/>
 <br/>
A client of mine in Tucson AZ has been given a Japanese sword by a friend of<br/>
his. From the description it would seem to be in WWII mounts with a leather<br/>
combat cover, though it may have a partly civilian tsuka. My client is a<br/>
knowledgeable collector, but this is his first nihonto. He has ordered<br/>
several books and seems interested in knowing more, at least about this one<br/>
sword.<br/>
 <br/>
He was able to get the mekugi out but has not had the handle off, so we're<br/>
not sure if it's a bar-stock blade or the family Koto heirloom.<br/>
 <br/>
I'm sure I've met someone from Tucson at one of the shows, but a look<br/>
through my card file drew a blank. Anyone in the area willing to help out,<br/>
please get in touch with me directly with your contact info at<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:craigharris@...">craigharris@...</a> and I'll pass your info on to him.<br/>
