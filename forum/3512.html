<h3>Katana sharpness question</h3>
by <i>aballcsun</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1184922862">Hi all, I have a question re: the sharpness of an ancient sword. I'm <br/>
getting ready to teach a class about ancient Japan and that naturally <br/>
includes Samurai legend, lore, and also, facts.<br/>
I heard of a sword that holds the record for cutting through people. <br/>
It was either 5 or 7 bodies that the sword cut in half. I am having no <br/>
luck finding info about this. All I have found is a few references to <br/>
executions of this manner(rio-kuruma), but not much else.<br/>
If anyone has any info on where I could look, it would be most <br/>
helpful..<br/>
thanks..<br/>
