The amount of money I have invested in this blade is a whole $40.00  US.  The <br/>
amount  of material loss at the Kissaki  having looked  at it with my glasses <br/>
on is less  than  3/64" to my tired old  eyes.<br/>
 <br/>
I am thinking of sending it out, having it polished and remounted, now the  <br/>
question is to whom do I send it to for the polish. Fed Lohman has a gentleman  <br/>
who does polishing but I do not know of anyone who has used him and I do not  <br/>
want this blade ruined as I already saved it for a horrible fate as a yard <br/>
work  tool...<br/>
 <br/>
There is a lot of activity (due to the water/brine quenching)  along  the <br/>
Hamon that I can still see a bit though the very light surface oxidation.. I  <br/>
could be wrong but I feel that it could benefit from restoration, even as a  <br/>
simple "what the heck, let's do it" type of project.<br/>
 <br/>
I just don't want to be trying to make a silk purse out of a sow's ear if  <br/>
you know what I mean... I will try to get some photos taken if I can get decent  <br/>
ones out of my ancient camera.<br/>
 <br/>
Now it is my understanding from the research that I have done that Kanesane  <br/>
did make quite a few blades personally, as well as supervising his production  <br/>
company, how do I tell for sure  if this is a production blade or one he  <br/>
made himslef. I am leaning towards the former due to the Seki stamp on the  <br/>
nakago.<br/>
 <br/>
Any help is greatly appreicated.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1737514004">Typically Kanezane's personally made swords will have a showa stamp and feature a kakihan (stamped personal seal) following the mei on the nakago. The outline of his kakihan resembles the shape of a turtle with the Zane character in the center. The fact that there is a seki stamp leaves little doubt that this is a production sword. <br/>
