<h3>goto kodogu study</h3>
by <i>lucienberry</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1429365110">I was told by Mr. Ron Hartman on Robert Coles forum that this <br/>
group was for discussing Kodogu.  <br/>
  1) Who is considered to be the best goto master? <br/>
2) who in the goto ke had the least talent? <br/>
3) You hardly ever see Yujo's work except in museums. Are there any <br/>
books available that we could see such work?<br/>
4)What's the highest rating a goto master's work has gone to?<br/>
Anyone out there willing to show some early goto stuff in their <br/>
collection? <br/>
Regards, Lucien<br/>
  PS, Are there any dream n' drool Goto books out there with lots of <br/>
pics?</div>

Another good book is SWORD FITTINGS BY THE FAMILY OF GOTO  1440 - 1879 1994.  <br/>

I believe the NBTHK book by Fukushi Sensei is a very large volume that came out a year or so ago. If so--and I have a copy myself but have yet to really "get into it"--it is pricey and (I believe) out-of-print. The only book on Goto I had prior to this large work was the one titled: The 17 Generations of Goto (Japanese text). I have this in both hard cover and soft cover, I believe both being the same inside the covers. It seems very good but as always, so much is missed unless you can read Japanese. <br/>
<br/>
Hopefully those who attended this year's San Francisco show saw the small but significant display of Goto fittings put on by Rick Mantigani and Dan Burns. Absolutely awesome kodogu! Unbelievable crisp and "minty" items of high, high quality makers! This display has been shown the last few years but I really wonder how many people stop to study the treasures displayed. <br/>
<br/>
Some of these Goto fittings--and others--have been included as special inserts (high quality photos and printing) in the Northern California group's newsletter from time to time. <br/>

Actually I took some time to study it. So many<br/>
exceptional pieces in such a small space. <br/>
<br/>
Don't know if it was Rick or Dan I spoke with, but<br/>
they were nice to me as I pondered the hypnotic depth<br/>
of blackness in some of the menuki. I wrote down the<br/>
fellow's name, hoping to correspond further and get<br/>
some computer images if there were any to be had and<br/>
cataloged. Unfortunately the name/address got lost in<br/>
the paper shuffle of travelling back to the east<br/>
coast.<br/>
<br/>
If there are any images of that display available,<br/>

and the designs so much more full than can be done<br/>

 The 17 Generations of Goto (Japanese text). the hard and softback editions<br/>
are two different books, the hard cover is by Shimada and the soft cover is<br/>
the Sano Museum catalogue, both are out of print but I have the Sano at<br/>

Rick and Dan are both "as good as they come" and true "students" of Goto works and of the sword. Rick is the treasurer of the newly formed American branch of the NBTHK. Neither one participate on these discussion/chat groups. I have not checked the NCJSC's web site in awhile but it wouldn't surprise me to see some of these or some other equally fine kodogu pictured there. <br/>
<br/>
Quality made photographs are great but to see this quality of work a few inches from one's eyes, in the "flesh," is something else! This brings to mind a really fine tsuba I once owned signed Natsuo. It was good and Bob Haynes agreed, but also added that it would never "pass" in Japan. A couple years later I was at the Boston MFA and for the first time I saw a "real" Natsuo work and immediately, I recognized that my wonderful tsuba simply did not at all have the quality that radiated from that "real" Natsuo. Same with mainline Goto works. That "quality" speaks for itself!<br/>
