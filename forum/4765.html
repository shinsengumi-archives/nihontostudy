<h3>Re: Soten & Namban</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-902570528">Dear Elliot<br/>
<br/>
I know of no relationship whatsoever between the Namban and the Soten <br/>
groups of tsuba.  The only feature that may be considered common to <br/>
them both is some evidence of a Chinese influence.  However, while <br/>
with Namban tsuba this resulted in a completely novel metalworking <br/>
technique, Soten tsuba use conventional, Japanese techniques to <br/>
illustrate historical sujects which may be of Chinese derivation.  <br/>
But there a lots of differences:-<br/>
<br/>
Soten tsuba came initially from a recognised 'school' of makers, <br/>
although they were later mass produced outside this.  There was never <br/>
a recognised Namban 'school', the namban influence being ubiquitous.<br/>
<br/>
Namban tsuba had their origin in China, were imported into Japan at <br/>
the end of the C16, and reached the peak of their popularity in the <br/>
late C18.  Soten tsuba date from the early C18 and continued to be <br/>
made, as poor quality shiiremono, into the late Edo period.  <br/>
(Although I have no evidence for this, I suspect that many of the <br/>
latter may also have been produced using the 'lost wax' method of <br/>
casting.)<br/>
<br/>
True examples of the Namban group are characterised by extensive <br/>
openwork and undercutting, whereas with Soten tsuba, while they may <br/>
demonstrate some degree of openwork, this is not a constant feature <br/>
and never includes undercutting.<br/>
<br/>
Namban tsuba commonly have profuse gold decoration, either as nunome-<br/>
zogan or fire gilding.  Soten tsuba are characterised by selective <br/>
and delicate inlays of gold, silver, copper and shakudo.<br/>
<br/>
Soten tsuba do not demonstrate the decorartive mimi, seppa-dai and <br/>
ryo-hitsu which characterise Namban tsuba.  Signatures, although <br/>
admittedly usually gimei, feature frequently on Soten tsuba and <br/>
almost never in the Namban group.<br/>
<br/>
The design on Soten tsuba is themed, being is representative of <br/>
specific characters or incidents, while that on Namban tsuba is <br/>
purely decorative. <br/>
<br/>
No, I personally know of no relationship between the two groups.<br/>
<br/>
Regards, John L.<br/>

Nanban tsuba.<br/>
We have no comparison between Soten and Namban, is Nanban tsuba <br/>
related in some way to either Namban or Soten? It seems somewhere I <br/>
read about a Nanban tsuba signed Mogarashi Soten. Are these schools <br/>
related? I can see some likenesses between Nanban and Soten.<br/>
As always, thank you and the group for my continuing education.<br/>

Yes, that is were I saw the combination of names which led to some of <br/>
my confusion. I re-visited Aoi-Art and like what I see but their <br/>
