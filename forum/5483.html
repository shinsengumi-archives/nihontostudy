<div id="ygrps-yiv-780511948">Hi Patrik,<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
It would be helpful to remove the handle and see what the nakago looks like.<br/>
However, from the outside, there are basically two choices from my point of<br/>
view: made in China, which seems very likely, or a poorly done Yokohama-mono<br/>
or cheap export sword from the Meiji period or later. Rich has supplied a<br/>
third option (modern export model) and has been far more politic than I. In<br/>
the future, I would refrain from paying money of such things. You would be<br/>
better off spending your money on some (more) books.<br/>

Agreed the wood graining in the saya looks genuine and typical of that sort of work I have seen.  The brass fittings do not look to be of Japanese workmanship, especially the lack of a proper and neat finish where the metal edges meet the scabbard wood.  This is especially true where the handle butts up to the habaki.  The lack of a facing metal piece to the habaki indicates poor workmanship.  It may all be modern, but the proof of the pudding for the blade will be when you take the handle off and see the tang.  Do this - remove the habaki and take good closeup photos of both sides of the tang and put them up.  The blade is the typical shape of a Meiji tourist piece, but running through the images again I'm of the opinion that the koshirae is modern as it just does not have the refinement of shape that we expect to see in Japanese workmanship.  So the blade may be old, but if it does not have a clear and distinguishable hamon it is nonetheless a "junk" piece.<br/>

take the juiche of a lemmon and wipe it over the cuttingedge until you see<br/>
a hamon normally it is there in these kind of blades.<br/>
after that clean the blade and when you are lucky you wil see the hamon<br/>
still.<br/>

<br/>
you are wrong, read more books, because that is clearly were you get your<br/>
knowledge<br/>
this is tipical a tourist item, normally there is a hamon, and some jihada.<br/>
i am togishi and i have seen a lot of those, people wanted me to polish<br/>
them but i can not spent my time on things like that.<br/>
here in europe there are a lot of them and some of them are very nice to see.<br/>
so my advice look around a little bit better<br/>

You may want to research the name Gordon Robson before you make such<br/>

Also, I have yet to find a traditional togishi that will advise people<br/>
to use lemon juice on a blade (or even confidently call themselves a<br/>
