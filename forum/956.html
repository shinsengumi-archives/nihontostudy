Jim has given you the best lists to pass on, but if you wish to point Mom<br/>
and kid in the direction of a bit of romance, you should give them the<br/>
reference to the 1965+/- men's magazine that had a very lurid article<br/>
supposedly by Albert Yamanaka with swords from Bumpei Usui's collection.<br/>
That piece as a list of lost treasures together with information on when<br/>
and here they were turned in and went missing. It includes kana spelling of<br/>
the names of various GI's who supposed accepted the swords. It is much more<br/>
fun than a simple list -- but probably  less accurate. The kid would also<br/>
probably like look at the dirty pictures in the mag and by today's<br/>
standard, Mom probably wouldn't mind. I have a copy, but I can't remember<br/>
the name.<br/>

Interesting.  In the intro to the missing kokuho section list in the YNL, Yamanaka mentions contributing to a magazine article on the subject by Alan Schwartz.  He doesn't mention the name of the magazine the article was published in... for reasons that are now obvious assuming that this is the same article.  The date would be a rough match.<br/>

  Jim has given you the best lists to pass on, but if you wish to point Mom<br/>
  and kid in the direction of a bit of romance, you should give them the<br/>
  reference to the 1965+/- men's magazine that had a very lurid article<br/>
  supposedly by Albert Yamanaka with swords from Bumpei Usui's collection.<br/>
  That piece as a list of lost treasures together with information on when<br/>
  and here they were turned in and went missing. It includes kana spelling of<br/>
  the names of various GI's who supposed accepted the swords. It is much more<br/>
  fun than a simple list -- but probably  less accurate. The kid would also<br/>
  probably like look at the dirty pictures in the mag and by today's<br/>
  standard, Mom probably wouldn't mind. I have a copy, but I can't remember<br/>
  the name.<br/>

Jim and All,<br/>
I got the magazine out last night and think it is interesting enough in the<br/>
history of sword collecting to recall to other. The article appears in the<br/>
SAGA, 1965, I think the August issue. The 'article' is really very short<br/>
and full of total hooey. Yamanaka is mentioned as the authority but not the<br/>
author. There are about a dozen nicely mounted swords shown<br/>
non-technically. These are noted as from the Ussui collection, but not<br/>
described at all. Then there is the list of 14 lost treasures. Each of<br/>
these gets a couple of paragraphs that list maker, date of recognition, and<br/>
date/place of surrender and in most cases the name of the American soldier<br/>
who received it. The source of this information is not explained.<br/>
My recollection is that the list that Albert presented in the Newsletter<br/>
was longer, but much less detailed in that it did not contain all the other<br/>
background information. I have never seen this list presented anywhere<br/>
else.<br/>

Can Peter Bleed contact me at this email address.<br/>
There seems to be some sort of problem with his email.<br/>
<br/>
Email messages to him have bounced, and an attempt to<br/>
reply to a message of his from the above '.edu'<br/>
address seems to have bounced as well.<br/>
