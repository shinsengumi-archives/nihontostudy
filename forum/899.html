<div id="ygrps-yiv-1457878704">Hi Doug,<br/>
<br/>
The tanto is mine. It is indeed in shirasaya, and also has Tanobe<br/>
sensei's sayagaki on it. <br/>
<br/>
You hit on a lot of items why it is a collectable piece. There are a lot<br/>
of activities in the hamon too, making it a good study sword, and of<br/>
course it is also representative of its times. <br/>
<br/>
The horimono are not etched as was previously suggested by the question<br/>
asker. Horimono like this are carved. Naotsuna are often found with<br/>
bohi, but horimono like this are quite rare on his works, and there are<br/>
very few tanto by this smith (none are signed).<br/>
<br/>
There are three mekugi ana most likely on this tanto because it has gone<br/>
into three different sets of fittings (or more) over its lifetime. That,<br/>
and the frequent polishing, would likely point to this as being a well<br/>
used weapon, rather than something that spent most of its life as an<br/>
object of adoration. Those are my guesses at it.<br/>
<br/>
For the original poster, in terms of the high end Soshu smiths, this<br/>
represents entry-level price, so the question is more one of what is<br/>
holding this one back from higher prices I would think. The hamon is<br/>
still lively on this tanto, but it is at the point where I wouldn't want<br/>
to put one, or two more polishes on it. That is pretty much the only<br/>
thing against it in my book, but then there are others who have<br/>
different tastes in school, smith, period, and type.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-991546339">Hi Darcy,<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for the frank comments.  I think you are right concerning <br/>
discussions of valuation -- subjective, hard to do without the piece <br/>
in hand, and can cause unintended results.  I apologise to you, <br/>
especially, and to any other member who was bothered by my naive <br/>
observations.<br/>
<br/>
Your expanded description will help me alot in appreciating this <br/>
blade, and in my self-designed home study course - Nihonto 101, <br/>
Introduction to the Japanese Sword.  Which somebody should offer at <br/>
my local community college or Japanese culture center.  <br/>
<br/>
Thank you again.  I will try to listen [read] more and speak <br/>
[comment] less.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Don't speak less... <br/>
<br/>
It may cut down on opportunities to learn.<br/>
<br/>
Other people disagree strongly with my approach to valuation as well.<br/>
<br/>
Often times on various subjects I have found that when you put forth an<br/>
opinion as a statement, people are more prepared to offer up information<br/>
in challenge than they would if you put it forth as a question and they<br/>
were answering.<br/>
<br/>
That is, if you were having trouble with your Mac, if you said, "Macs<br/>
suck because they cannot do XYZ" someone would jump up and tell you that<br/>
they could so do XYZ and here's how, than if you did just asking how to<br/>
do XYZ on your Mac :-).<br/>

the great works of the great smiths of old. There are some truly nice<br/>
things out there. Ron Polansky has one on his site that I keep<br/>
considering buying. Gorgeous sword by a Mukansa smith.<br/>

<br/>
Ooooh - that's a question that usually starts a jihad...  Most "real" <br/>
dealers will make comments<br/>
about how buying a new sword is like buying a new car - you lose money <br/>
the moment you<br/>
drive it off the lot and/or will make disparaging comments about how <br/>
they don't consider them<br/>
"real" swords and don't look at them much or...  And a lot of "real" <br/>
sword collectors are also<br/>
of this opinion....<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, I've heard it said that the better modern stuff is as <br/>
good as or better than<br/>
all but the best of the shinto era pieces. (I personally think this is <br/>
closer to correct, but then<br/>
again, I'm crazy enough to actually have a couple modern pieces, so <br/>
YMMV...).<br/>
<br/>
If you wish to buy one, its a real minefield - there are a LOT of extant <br/>
pieces out there, often<br/>
at prices far below what the person who originally <br/>
purchased/commissioned the piece<br/>
probably paid, but then again, an object is really only worth what the <br/>
next guy is willing to pay<br/>
for it, but I digress...  Because of this, I'm not sure I'd consider <br/>
having one commissioned - just<br/>
look for a extant piece in the style you like by the maker you like with <br/>
the activities you like to pop up<br/>
(it sounds nuts, but it does seem to eventually happen...).<br/>
You also have to realize that you probably will end up selling it at a <br/>
loss if you ever decide to.<br/>
<br/>
There's a whole market built up around mukansa and mukansa wannabee <br/>
level stuff versus guys<br/>
who don't enter the competitions/don't win, yada yada - perhaps a trip <br/>
to the shinsakuto site<br/>
listed on rich's site would help you learn more about this...<br/>
<br/>

Good Luck,<br/>
