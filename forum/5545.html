<h3>Recently acquired blade.</h3>
by <i>atarbaktar</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1373078608">Hello:<br/>
 <br/>
I recently acquired a sword blade ONLY at a yard sale. From what I can tell  <br/>
it was made around 1943ish by Asano Kanasane I have attached a picture of what <br/>
I  have found on reference. The Mei is to me an exact match of example "C". <br/>
 <br/>
There is a small chip on the Ho, that is almost not viewable but it is  <br/>
"feelable" as well as several parry marks on the Mune. The very end of the  Kissaki <br/>
(approx  1/16") is broken off.<br/>
<br/>
From the sources I have found this blade was very probably a showato  sword <br/>
made for the Japanese Army. There are no other mounts or anything.<br/>
 <br/>
Now I know this isn't a "real collectable" but for the "investment" I made  I <br/>
feel that it would be worth a decent polish as I can see a great deal of  <br/>
activity along the Hamon even through the very light oxidation on the  blade.<br/>
 <br/>
I will send some photos once I get them taken (my photographic  skills  are <br/>
marginal at best) if there is any interest.  My skills lay more in the  <br/>
metalworking end of things...<br/>
 <br/>
SO if anyone on the list is interested in helping out an old hammerhead I  <br/>
would appreciate it..<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1277860569">Kanesane swords do have a fairly good following for a showato in part thanks to the Fuller and Gregory book and the fact that most were water quenched. A broken tip unfortunately will require a foundation polish making it difficult to get away with anything short of a costly polish and a good polisher. <br/>
