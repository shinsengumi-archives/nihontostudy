<h3>Question on mineral oil</h3>
by <i>matt1231@y7mail.com</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-926936913">I received this week my polished & mounted in a shirasaya, Kogatana from <br/>
Takano san in Tokyo, made with him in a very enjoyable day working with <br/>
his forge & filing (a lot of filing!).<br/>
<br/>
Showing it to family & friends, twice I forgot to say "don't touch the <br/>
steel" both times I cringed as fingers grabbed it. I can tell you it's <br/>
cured me of showing a Japanese blade (albeit a small one) to people whom <br/>
don't understand what there is to appreciate.<br/>
<br/>
My question relates to protective oil. Obviously I felt a little urgency <br/>
to clean & protect! In NZ we don't have ready access to choji oil. <br/>
Looking on the web I found several references to using mineral oil (not <br/>
stocked in NZ pharmacies) or gun oil.<br/>
<br/>
After a visit to the local gun ship, I walked out with Remington "Rem <br/>
Oil Wipes". But I'm not happy with the results, possibly caused by the <br/>
additives in the wipes like teflon & who knows what else.<br/>
<br/>
The polished surface of blade, whilst not exactly dulled, no longer <br/>
shows Takano san's hada as well as it did. Additionally I now have that <br/>
multicoloured oily sheen over the surface, but that may be normal?<br/>
<br/>
Mineral Oil. References I've read refer to it as a laxative and finding <br/>
it in your local pharmacy. Obviously we do things different here in <br/>
little ol' New Zealand! But I'm reluctant to purchase anything from the <br/>
hardware store until I know better what it is I'm getting.<br/>
<br/>
Can someone suggest product names or precise details on what mineral oil <br/>
is in the US, so I can find a NZ match.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the help.<br/>

Sugiyama does not handle things anymore, at least not directly. I've always used Bob Benson as agent but understand Robert Hughs also does this service. I'm sure there are others that people use, too. <br/>
<br/>
As for shinsa results, of course a fully polished sword will allow for a more reliable judgement by the team, but a sword just a little out of full polish would probably work okay. The judges have to be able to see and read the sword's characteristics, so if that is mostly hidden, well, they can't see behind what's hidden. If there is a signature, I guess they would paper it based on that, but I'd say condition needs to be reasonably good. <br/>

Not too difficult to source. Light machine oil is fine. Choji oil isn't pure oil of cloves...it is light machine oil with a few drops of clove oil for scent. Don't use pure clove oil.<br/>
If you are getting too much of a sheen, you are using too much. A few drops on the appropriate tissue, wipe over lightly a few times, and store. You shouldn't be coating the blade.<br/>

And thinking about it, you are right in that I'm using too much with <br/>
these gun wipes. I should have figured that out myself.<br/>

  Subject: [nihontostudy] NBTHK shinsa<br/>
<br/>
  Been awhile since I sent a sword to Japan for advice at the NBTHK as to whether <br/>
<br/>
  a sword will shinsa well, before polishing. I used to go thru Oscar, Mr. <br/>
<br/>
  Sugiyama. Anyway, who handles this these days. BobElder www.orlandotaikai.com<br/>
