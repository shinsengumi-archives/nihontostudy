<h3>a little more direction</h3>
by <i>elliottshogun</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1353667284">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
This is a continuance of my 'questions' and some new ones....<br/>
<br/>
In my photo album, I have added new pictures (#1 and #2) of a <br/>
Kunitomo piece. I am confused as to which path to follow. I am open <br/>
to direction.<br/>
<br/>
Photo's #5 and #6 are the best close-up's of the Myochin mei I can <br/>
get with my lack of good photo equipment. Hopefully these will help <br/>
in deciding which one (Muneharu or Muneyoshi). And maybe Santa Claus <br/>
will be good to me and bring me a new camera with Macro lens.<br/>
<br/>
Last, I have a mei that I can't seem to find in any volume I have. <br/>
The mei is 'Nagoya Tsunenari'. He also signed 'Bishu Mihara Ju <br/>
Nagoya Tsunenari'. I can't find him anywhere.<br/>
<br/>
As always, thank you all for your help. <br/>

I just needed a little 'prod' to remember what you found. I saved <br/>
all of the messages and a copy of the scan from your album. <br/>
<br/>
All is well with the Myochin. Now to the other's.<br/>

Muneharu. Pete's already had a good go at describing this smith I think. <br/>
In regards to the Kunitomo, I have 5 listed, and I am not sure of this <br/>
one myself. I see no signature so I am assuming it was sold to you with <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-166352076">To clarify a bit on the "Kunitomo" tsuba, I owned that one for a number of<br/>
years. I bought it from Skip Holbrook, and that's where the attribution came<br/>
from, I think because of the sahari inlay work reminding one of similar work<br/>
by the Kunitomo gunsmiths. No one who saw this tsuba, Jim Gilbert, Bob<br/>
Haynes, etc. could think of anything better to call it. I'm pretty sure that<br/>
Bob said he did not recognize the kao.<br/>
<br/>
No papers, unless Elliot has taken that step ... it would be interesting to<br/>
see what 'box' the experts would put it in.<br/>

<br/>
That's correct. I have no attribution or paper and have not <br/>
submitted this tsuba for paper. I found 4 or 5 Kunitomo's and needed <br/>
some help as to which one or ones to study. <br/>
<br/>
I appreciate the help, if you think of anything else, let me know.<br/>
