<h3>Another kodzuka for identification ...</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1248728660">Once again I am shamelessly using your combined expertise to my own <br/>
ends.<br/>
<br/>
The kodzuka illustrated in my photo album JPL is ex the Ransom <br/>
collection.  Within a raised rim, on a panel of fine horizontal <br/>
shakudo nanako, is a group of fruit, flowers and vegetation depicted <br/>
in high relief.  The fruit and flowers are of gold, the leaves and <br/>
stems of shakudo with gold drops of water.  There is a second, <br/>
smaller group nearter to the blade.  The reverse is of polished <br/>
shakudo with a segment, including the butt, of gold with delicate <br/>
draw scratching.  The kodzuka is uninscribed.<br/>
<br/>
This appears to be Goto work of a high quality, but I am completely <br/>
inadequate for any attemt to identify the maker solely on the basis <br/>
of the image and style.<br/>
<br/>
Can anybody please help.  See <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://tinyurl.com/77rxt">http://tinyurl.com/77rxt</a><br/>

With thanks, JPL.</div>

I've been out of town.  The kozuka is in Goto style, but in the photos it looks like what is usually described as Kyo-Kinko at shinsa.  The metal, carving, nanako, etc., are in the style, but not up to the level of Goto work.  The urasogi is unusual in copy work.<br/>
