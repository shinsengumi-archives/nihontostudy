<h3>I didnt get the sword as pictured in the ebay auction ...</h3>
by <i>ranox27157</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-250718202">I didnt get the sword as pictured in the ebay auction, but what I <br/>
actually got has now caused a bit of concern. I brought the sword <br/>
over to a freind's party wearing it as a costume accessory, as I <br/>
thought it was a fake with little value. At the party their was a <br/>
gentleman that is a metallurgy expert, he told me he has spent years <br/>
researching the ancient technology of Japanese sword making and <br/>
personally had met with several professors in Japan. He carefully <br/>
examined my sword and made a few comments. His comment are as <br/>
follows. The blade was hand forged, not machine forged and not <br/>
etched with acid. He spoke in lenth about the temper of the blade <br/>
and types of metal used. The tang of the sword had been shorted and <br/>
reshaped from the original form. The overall shape and shape of the <br/>
point, was consistent with an older form (the blade narrows down to <br/>
a small point). I am seeking to learn the parts of the blade, and <br/>
not sound so much like a rookie. <Laughs><br/>
   He further told me some interesting things about the sword, and <br/>
it these things that have caused my concern.  The mounting of the <br/>
sword is consistent with special mountings used as presentation <br/>
swords to be given to visiting German Officers. The said that about <br/>
183 swords were remade as these presentation swords. The thing for <br/>
me to worry about is that the swords used were in some cases family <br/>
swords, some were obtained without the family's permission, and some <br/>
were donated because there was now aparent heirs. He went on to <br/>
explain that the family swords were in many cases not marked by the <br/>
maker or smith (no MEI). But a good clue to a family sword is the <br/>
the etching or engraving of a name on the blade. That is the name of <br/>
a warrior killed by the sword (and by placing the warriors name on <br/>
the blade, his soul is captured in the steel). Swords having these <br/>
markings on the blade are very traceable, and there might be a legal <br/>
dispute should someone in the family seek the return of the sword to <br/>
their family.<br/>
    I took the handle off the tang and photographed the parts of the <br/>
sword as best I could. I will be posting the pictures in a photo <br/>
folder named GERMAN. I would like any comments on the blade directed <br/>
to me personally. < <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:Ranox27157@...">Ranox27157@...</a> > Should it turn out that <br/>
this is one of the presentation swords, but without a legal issue, I <br/>
will either sell it or donate in to the loical WWII museum.</div>

If your expert is telling you stuff like this, I would question the rest <br/>
of his opinion as well.  This sounds like the worst kind of popular <br/>
western mythology, right up there with "don't resheath the sword without <br/>
blood on the blade."<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1351241176">The story about warrior's name is bs. The story about special<br/>
presentation fittings is most likely bs too - if you want an opinion<br/>
it's possible if you provide some pictures.<br/>

If there is a swastika on the scabbard - it's a chinese fake. If you<br/>
can find a sword on e-bay that looks 100% like yours - it's a chinese<br/>
fake.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1516680051">I have a book called, Military Swords of Japan 1868-1945, by Richard <br/>
Fuller & Ron Gregory and in parts of the book it does say that some of <br/>
the Swords which were surrendered (not all, but some) had letters with <br/>
them, some had engravings put onto them. <br/>
<br/>
Here is a caption from page 103, Plate 110:<br/>
This well-engraved surrender inscription appears on the habaki of an <br/>
army officer's shin-gunto.  The obverse reads, 'Surrendered by Shosa <br/>
(Major) Nagamura Kiyotaka, Japanese VIII army, Emirau Island, 21st March <br/>
1944'.  The reverse reads, 'To A. B. Boyles, U.S.M.C.'.  This is an <br/>
example of a spurious postwar engraving added to increase value:  <br/>
research indicates that Emirau was evacuated by the Japanese two months <br/>
before the invasion of the US 4th Marines on 20 March 1944.  The USMC <br/>
has no record of an A. B. Boyles. (R. Gregory collection.)<br/>
<br/>
My point is, there are swords with Inscriptions on them.  You need to <br/>
thoroughly check it out.  Research your pieces.<br/>
