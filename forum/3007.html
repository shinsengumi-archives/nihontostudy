Just in case someone collects Japanese Armor Helmet, there is one up for <br/>
Auction here in Portland, Oregon, the Sale is on June 6, 7 and 8th at <br/>
7:00pm PST (West Coast Time).  You can see the info on the website at <br/>
the Auction House O'Gallerie<br/>

<br/>
They call it a Rare Antique Japanese Armor Collection 33 Plate Suji <br/>
Kabuto (Helmet).  They have a ton of other stuff and I would e-mail them <br/>
and see if they can send you a photo of the items, as I don't guarantee <br/>
anything that they sell.  They do allow for returns if it turns out not <br/>
to be what they said it was.<br/>

In the Search put in Japanese and you will come up with lots of items.<br/>
