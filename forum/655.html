<h3>Mumei Hizen blades</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-439426990">Dear All,<br/>
I am seeking opinion and others experience. I have had many long and very enjoyable conversations with Roger Robertshaw about a katana blade I currently own. It appears to be an early Tadayoshi blade. This is confirmed by a sayagaki and a presentation inscription dated 1922.<br/>
I am reasonably confident that it is indeed early Hizen work. However Roger is rightly sceptical about the existence of unsigned Hizen work being attributed to the mainline school. With a nagasa of 65.2cm. there is just the possibility that it is O-suriage and has lost the original signature. Alternatively it could be that it was never signed. I intend to submit the blade at the forthcoming NTHK shinsa in London. Does anyone know of unsigned Tadayoshi blades that have received papers?<br/>
any opinions and information much appreciated<br/>
thanks<br/>
Paul<br/>
