<h3>SOTEN tsuba</h3>
by <i>elliottshogun</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-742752977">Gentlemen,<br/>
I have a strong, growing desire to purchase more SOTEN tsuba. I also <br/>
feel a lack of knowledge about this style/school. I have read the <br/>
portion about SOTEN in the Nihon-to Koza. Is there any other printed <br/>
material available for me to read? Could the group give me an <br/>
education about SOTEN?<br/>
Any knowledge you pass on to me is greatly appreciated. <br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Elliott</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1788957659">From 'Tsuba -- an Aesthetic Study' by Torigoye, trans. Haynes<br/>
<br/>
Soten Tsuba<br/>
The first Soten lived in Kyoto in his early life.  Later, he moved to <br/>
Hikone in Omi Province and worked there about the Kyoho era (1716-<br/>
36).  He received many orders from Kyoto and was obliged to travel <br/>
back and forth between the two cities.  No matter which city he <br/>
worked in, he would sign as a resident of Hikone.<br/>
<br/>
The first Soten had many students who helped him produce Soten style <br/>
tsuba.  In fact, during his lifetime, the demand for his style of <br/>
tsuba became so great that he and his school could not keep up with <br/>
the orders.  In Kyoto, the Hiragiya school and, in Aizu, the Shoami <br/>
school, made Soten style tsuba to help fill the orders for the many <br/>
requests received from all parts of the country.<br/>
<br/>
There are several opinions concerning the number of generations of <br/>
the main line Soten masters.  Some say there were two, or that there <br/>
were three, or even more.  The most logical is two.<br/>
<br/>
The first Soten signed his early work Shuten.  The second generation <br/>
used only the name Soten.  In addition to these two artists there are <br/>
at least twenty-five well-known students who signed their work with <br/>
their own names, and innumerrable students who signed with the name <br/>
Soten, or did not sign their work at all.  A student of note is <br/>
Soshu, an above average worker, but the most famous student is Nomura <br/>
Kanenori:  his best work is about equal to that of the seond Soten.<br/>
<br/>
There are slight differeces between the signatures of the first and <br/>
second Soten.  The first signed with kanji of about average size.  <br/>
The second used kanji slightly smaller than the size of the first.  <br/>
There are other differences in their work, such as the designs of the <br/>
second being more picturesque and detailed.  The surface of his plate <br/>
is very busy and brilliant; the design covering the major portion of <br/>
the web area.  The first also used small figures in the designs but <br/>
he did not cover as much of the web area with his decoration.  He did <br/>
not use as much inlay of gold and silver.  From the style of carving <br/>
used mainly by the second Soten this school has come to be called <br/>
Hikonebori school.<br/>
<br/>
Shape:  round/oval<br/>
Plate Metal:  the first used iron plate.  The second used iron, and <br/>
in some cases shakudo plate.<br/>
Carving:  human figures, landscapes, flowers and birds, historical <br/>
subjects of either Chinese of Japanese derivation.  The inlay is <br/>
usually gold, copper, silver, and shakudo.  Human faces will be <br/>
either silver or copper inlay.  Both masters used pure silver for <br/>
their inlay.<br/>
Signiture:  Goshu Hikone no Ju Shoheishi Niudo Soten Sei.  He also <br/>
signed with a very long signiture:  Goshu Hikone Nakayabu no Ju <br/>
Soheishi Niudo Kitagawa Soten Sei.<br/>
<br/>
Summary:<br/>
The first and second Soten were splendid at their chosen style.  The <br/>
iron is of good quality but the tempering is quite common.  The <br/>
nikubori is inferior.  He tried to cover this fault in the iron <br/>
quality by making a good edge and using fine decoration.  Although <br/>
their work is usually on iron plate, the plate is subordinate to the <br/>
decoration.  Their work should be judged on the quality of the <br/>
carving, inlay and designs.<br/>
<br/>
Later Soten Tsuba:<br/>
The majority of the work in the style of this school is but poor <br/>
imitation made by shiiremono makers in the late Edo age at the docks <br/>
of Yokohama.  These imitations account for more than ninety-five <br/>
percent of all Soten tsuba extant.  Even the best work of the <br/>
students, though not common, is usually only slightly better than the <br/>
shiiremono examples.  The work of this school was so corrupted that a <br/>
true idea of the real Soten tsuba is almost impossible to obtain.  It <br/>
is unfortunate that the best work of this school has come under the <br/>
same pale of suspicion that surrounds the common work of the <br/>
immitators.  Had the work of this school been less papular, the true <br/>
work of the first and second Soten might be regarded with more <br/>
respect than it now receives.<br/>
authors note:  the term Hikonebori means the original style of <br/>
carving of the Soten school.  It is a combination of low relief, line <br/>
carving, some shishiai, detailed iroye inlay and elaborate openwork.  <br/>
In reality it is but one type of ubu-zukashi, and is found rarely in <br/>
the early work of the first and second Soten.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1699527750">Thank you very much. This is a great help. It's scary looking at <br/>
SOTEN tsuba, trying to figure out if it's real old or not. I saved <br/>
the Juyo piece as a screen saver. <br/>
<br/>
Thank you all again,<br/>
