<div id="ygrps-yiv-1459952828">hi<br/>
thank you for your membership...a friend from another forum <br/>
recommended me here to further my research for a tsuba i have <br/>
aquired.a brief story and pictures and measurements will follow as <br/>
soon as i know how to post them.was told and have written proof via a <br/>
simple letter that this tsuba was given to the head of a refrectory <br/>
in 1920 by 2 japanese goverment officials over here in the uk on a <br/>
goverment survey on our penal/poor law/social law and this tsuba was <br/>
given as thank you gift,it has never been mounted and in exeptionel <br/>
condition.it has been seen by roy bottomley of the royal armouries in <br/>
leeds who passed in on to a more knowledgable chap from a well known <br/>
sword society called steve smith.his opinion is a nara or more likely <br/>
aizu shoami tsuba of around 1850...1890.if the later then its the <br/>
more quality piece has its well thought out and the quality of the ji <br/>
is so good,surmie kashiga of japan has also given more or less the <br/>
same opinion stating that the quality is very good,,,,,any <br/>
information that you can give me would be warmly welcomed....more <br/>
info can be posted so please ask what ever you require.....once again <br/>
thank you</div>
