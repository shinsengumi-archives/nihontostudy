<div id="ygrps-yiv-1457761982">Hi Dave and All,<br/>
<br/>
  I have been singing the praises of Francis Boyd for almost twenty years now. I have ever been able to jst plunk down the dash and a commission a piece fro him, but if I were to get a custom made shinsakuto, I would want one from Francis above any other living swordsmith.  If you can spend some time with him, like the author did, you will easily understand my sentiments.  Thanks for sharing, Go Eli!<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>

I would  like to read some about this from the specialists too. <br/>
For me it is unbelievable that a sword exists older than 1500 years. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1203338918">Hello:<br/>
 <br/>
Ok my "area of expertise" is NOT exactly the Japanese sword..(although I  <br/>
have made quite a few using the same methods, materials...etc for my  <br/>
books...)<br/>
 <br/>
However there are numerous examples of various swords from the Bronze Age  <br/>
that survive to this very day..so as far as what Mr Boyd says..I would TEND <br/>
to  believe him at face value...however even the "best" of us can be mislead.<br/>
 <br/>
I CAN  however "vouch" for the "Blood Rust" effect on blades as I have  <br/>
seen it happen on various pieces I have restored..however the only pieces I <br/>
have  seen it happen with are pieces from WWII and some from the "War to End <br/>
All  Wars"..WWI.... Now I am not saying anything other than what I personally <br/>
have  seen... now I do have some questions as far as this particular blade <br/>
goes..I  find it interesting that in all the years and centuries past that no <br/>
one cleaned  the blood off of said sword.. But this is "just me"...<br/>
