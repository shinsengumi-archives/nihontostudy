<h3>Book Sale 50% Off</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-882576277">Please pardon the commercial posting, duplicate posting, and if you have<br/>
seen this on the Nihonto Message Board already.<br/>
<br/>
I started a 50% off sale on all books on my website except consignment books<br/>
(those with CONSIGNED in the description) on the NMB a few days ago, and<br/>
wanted to extend it to all on all the lists.<br/>
The sale will continue for at least a few more days, and I will announce the<br/>
end of the sale with about 24 hours notice.<br/>
<br/>
I will reduce the prices on consigned books as much as I can but most of<br/>
them have nominal markups.<br/>
<br/>
Shipping at cost.<br/>
<br/>
All other terms per my website. All orders are processed by me and totals<br/>
including shipping confirmed before your credit card (or PayPal) is charged<br/>
- nothing is automatic about the back end of my website.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for looking,<br/>

I'm not going to Tampa, haven't been in a number of years, so I won't be<br/>
there to compete with your copy in person.<br/>
<br/>
If you're driving and have room, throw it in. I never had the time to drive,<br/>
so the economics of being a bookseller anywhere except the Chicago show<br/>
never worked for me.<br/>
<br/>
As far as the pricing, it's all supply and demand, and I have more supply<br/>
than I need, and haven't found anyone willing to take books for food,<br/>
tuition, etc.<br/>
<br/>
See you in Chicago!<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1467666322">Hi Craig - <br/>
<br/>
Yes, I would say the good old economy has put a lot of us on hold for awhile. Both of those books are super and I'm sure any buyers will be thrilled to get them at a great  price. Unfortunately, I bought my copies as they became available, but hey, I'm happy. I still remember your display of books at one of the shows. I couldn't imagine going through all that work of transporting all that "weight." Made me think of the old days when my wife and I used to bring all those books and stuff to shows for the JSS/US. Makes my back hurt just thinking of it! <br/>
<br/>
Hope sales pick up, for books and for our for sale swords and fittings! <br/>

I've had a large display of books for sale at the last 4 or 5 Chicago shows<br/>
- 3 or 4 tables large - but I only live about 15 miles away. This year's<br/>
might be a table less, since I sold my truck recently, but I do have help<br/>
with the heavy lifting.<br/>
