<h3>back to the drawing board, and a shameless plug...</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1680311480">hey guys,<br/>
<br/>
After photographing a couple  of my latest acquisitions:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://home.teleport.com/~rkg/photos/ko_kinko_front_small.JPG">http://home.teleport.com/~rkg/photos/ko_kinko_front_small.JPG</a><br/>
<br/>
I got some complaints that this looked too "milky" (funny about that <br/>
because I was using the<br/>
ol' milkjug diffuser :-) )<br/>
<br/>
These next couple of pics were taken using the traditional skim skim <br/>
lighting that I normally use<br/>
on tsuba (see menuki3 and menuki4 in the yahoo photo album below:)<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
This still had the highlights kind of "blown out" so I then tried a <br/>
technique they had described in that<br/>
color, light and magic book I've been studyin' - namely, putting a gobo <br/>
between the light and the menuki.<br/>
since this renders the piece very dark, I had to up the exposure by a <br/>
couple of stops to compensate.  Note<br/>
that I didn't get them quite the right size and that you see a little <br/>
blue from the painters tape I use to hold<br/>
all this stuff up, but still...)  These can be seen in menuki3_gobo and <br/>
menuki4_gobo  I suspect<br/>
I could darken up the background and improve things more, but...<br/>
<br/>
I also tried this with another recent acquistion using the same <br/>
nomenclature (see menuki1 & menuki2 in this<br/>
same directory).  Here you can see that the gold doesn't get as "washed <br/>
out".<br/>
<br/>
So what do you guys think?  Which method looks better?<br/>
<br/>
In case you're bored, you can also check out my other photo directories <br/>
here - the pointer to some recent pics of<br/>
my Yamato shizu katana  is:<br/>

<br/>
Obviously I did this during the day and need some more background to <br/>
hide material (and a stronger spotlight and...),<br/>
but still...<br/>
<br/>
And finally, I've turned to the dark side and have a Canon 10D coming, <br/>
so the camera that took those pics above<br/>
is for sale (canon G2 with a pile of interesting accessories (filters, <br/>
filter adapters, yada yada) - contact me privately<br/>
if interested (just thought I'd ask before throwing it up on ebay...).<br/>
<br/>
P.S.  Like the sword holder?  if anybody has a line on some 2" square <br/>
nylon, delrin, or some sort of uhmw pe plastic<br/>
rod that is black, I'd love to hear about it...</div>
