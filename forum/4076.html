<h3>Nihonto and Tosogu meet Star Trek...</h3>
by <i>klepet33319</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-231494221">OK -- now this is a little exercise in how dissimilar interests come <br/>
together in mysterious ways.  While reading up on Yagyu tsuba in <br/>
the 'Selected Fine Japanese Swords from European NBTHK Collections' I <br/>
ran across an interesting reference to Yagyu Yoshikane Renya (1625-<br/>
94) who is the founder of the Yagyu style of sword guards.  <br/>
Apparently after retiring from being the fourth master of the school <br/>
he set about the design of tsuba, having them crafted by many leading <br/>
Owari tsubako of the day.  His workshop was located in the village of <br/>
Kobayashi, south of Nagoya Castle, and he took the priest name of <br/>
Kobayashi Osho.  Now anyone who is into Star Trek knows of the famous <br/>
Kobayashi Maru Scenerio, which is a test of an officer candidates <br/>
character in the face of certain defeat/death.  'No killing, no gain, <br/>
no win, no lose -- the sword of Shinkage Ryu is not the sword style <br/>
of outside but the style of inside -- no formal style is our style';  <br/>
Yagyu Jubei Mitsuyoshi from his "Tsuki no sho".  <br/>
'Admiral Kirk, who had been monitoring the situation from the control <br/>
room decides to stop the simulation. The main viewscreen slides aside <br/>
as he walks into the room. Saavik asks for suggestions, to which Kirk <br/>
replies that she should pray as the Klingons don't take prisoners. <br/>
All the "deceased" officers begin to rise, the blowers begin blowing <br/>
the smoke in the simulator room clear, and the trainees are ordered <br/>
to report for debriefing. Saavik remains and protests that the test <br/>
was unfair as there was no way to win. Kirk tells her that how a <br/>
person faced death was as important as how they faced life';  from:<br/>
