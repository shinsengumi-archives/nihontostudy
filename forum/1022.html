<br/>
  Been having problems with receiving messages of late but I think it's fixed now. Please take a look at the three photos of a very nice tsuba owned by a friend of mine. It has a Kaneiye signature which I realize, is a long-shot, but the work is so "flowing" and the treatment, even with the plugged hitsu-ana with nanako, all looks so nice. I told my friend I'd ask for comments on this for him so here it is:<br/>

Good to hear that you're receiving messages again.  Unfortunately, the style of the plate, surface finish, inlay, carving and signature are not consistent with real Kaneie.  It is in nice condition and the hitsu ana are well filled.  It's probably by someone in Saga following the Kaneie style.  That plate treatment is also seen in later Shoami shiiremono work.<br/>
