Not a huge problem in general, but a significant departure from original condition.  At the higher levels of quality it can be an issue.  <br/>

They'd probably be attributed to Edo Kinko.  I don't think that getting an attribution to a school would be very likely.  FWIW, the style of the Nio in "052F" was used by Yokoya Somin.  His Juyo Bunkazai Nio futakoromono from the Kyoto National Museum was on display in Washington DC about five years ago in the big Art of Edo show at the National Gallery.  It would have been worth the trip even if that was the only thing to see.<br/>

I have seen them a fair number of times, but never thought about a pattern behind it.  As far as my memory can be trusted, I think that it's a mid to late Edo period thing.  I don't think I've seen it on Goto work, only machibori.  Those machibori examples have been by fairly to very big names.  I don't know of any school pattern or lineage behind it, but there could well be one (or maybe it was just a fashion).  I have the sense that it's often seen along with tanzaku mei (the signatures done on small plaques), but I don't know of any reason for that.  I don't think that I've seen the star piece soldered down like a true root.  It seems more like it is there to cover up the joint between the post and the back of the menuki.  ("Rootless" posts were also popular with machibori kinko during this time.)  Maybe it is soldered down but the solder is kept away from the edges.  If someone was out to create a forgery from scratch it'd be pretty easy to add these to enhance the fake if appropriate.  If just putting on a gimei or inserting a gimei tanzaku I don't know if the faker would bother with it.<br/>
<br/>
That's all I can think of right now and without doing research on it.  Does anyone know of any specific examples contradicting the above or of an existing analysis that explains what they're all about?<br/>

Yes, this is the same type of round peg and star root as on my Nio menuki. In fact, the menuki here are almost identical in design as your pair on the front, too, feature to feature. (Notice your other pair does not have the gold "rope?" over Nio's head as does this pair we're talking about.)<br/>

<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> >...it's a mid to late Edo period thing.  I don't think I've seen it on Goto >work, only machibori.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I tried to find the illustrated Shozui example without success, but I did find in Wakayama's book on menuki motif (name escapes me)two examples with the "star" root. Look at menuki nos. 98 and 104. I believe both are by Somin (#104 being appraised by Soyo???). I've no idea if the description of these menuki make mention of this style of root or not, but I doubt it. Not sure this proves anything except that Somin used this form of root. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> >"Rootless" posts were also popular with machibori kinko during this (later Edo) time.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Often wondered about that, too, and thinking about it, do recall that many "lesser" menuki do seem to be without "roots." This seems to go along with them being rather "flat" and often thick and sloppy side-walls. (Fascinating how the backsides of such small things can be so interesting!)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> >If just putting on a gimei or inserting a gimei tanzaku I don't know if the faker would >bother with it (star-form roots).<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, since you never see mention of this (at least in English) it would seem something a forger would not take the time to do. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> >Does anyone know of any specific examples contradicting the above or of an existing analysis >that explains what they're all about?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Unfortunately, as much as I enjoy early menuki, I'm certainly not a disciplined "researcher." Most of what I've learned has come from (in the early days) Tom Buttweiler and his articles. Dean Hartley was another ko-kinko person. Today, I rely on Bob Haynes and you, Jim. I should add Gordon to that list, knowing his interest in ko-anything. So what I am saying is that just about anything "factual" that anybody can add to this type of discussion is worthwhile. There is (seems to be) so little written about it, to my knowledge. <br/>
