menuki having two female posts which would fit onto a mekugi from both <br/>

Fred's kozuka is uttori, not suri-hagasshi .I have a similar kozuka I <br/>
bought from Cole  Contrell except the gold uttori  and the nanako at <br/>
the same spot are really worn ( sort of like Jim's menuki ).  Aoe's <br/>
menuki is more like condition problem to me even though the suri-<br/>
hagashi is a good " excuse " I can use later.......... =)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1486007430">I have been aware for a few years that the deliberate rubbing of gold to look<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2067156971">Hi Barry,<br/>
     It's an interesting study to be sure although I'm not aware of <br/>
too much available literature to 'study'.  The 'Bushido' magazines <br/>
from Robert Benson (1980's) had a lot of great information, and the <br/>
1976 Tai Kai from San Francisco book has a lot of information also (I <br/>
believe there's a copy at Bridge of Dreams).  They show up on Ebay <br/>
from time to time also.<br/>
     What I was referring to with the kozuka was the effect of <br/>
removing of gold revealing the substrate for effent, which you can <br/>
see better there than on the menuki where there is definatley wear <br/>
involved also.  Ezo menuki were fabricated on a positive mould from <br/>
thin copper sheet, then the gold was applied using a mercury <br/>
technique (probably heat evaporation), then burnished with a needle <br/>
to get the effect.  Uttori by definition is attachment of the inly <br/>
around the edges only, although I would imagine there is some form of <br/>
burnishing or other form of adhesion involved as well.  As far as the <br/>
wear to the menuki, hell, I hope I look that good when I'm that old!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-454380507">Hi Alan and thanks for the information on Mrs. Schneidman.  I will <br/>
have to look into finding the catalog.  <br/>
I just came upon this information today and it coincides with your <br/>
question.  It is from 'Kodogu' pg. 20, by Gunther Heckmann<br/>
<br/>
'Until a few years ago it was generally agreed that sword decorations <br/>
of this sort were produced by the Ainu, the native inhabitants of <br/>
Japan's northern island Ezo, which is nowadays called Hokkaido.  For <br/>
this reason these sort of objects are usually called Ezo koshirae.  <br/>
Because of the fact that the Ainu did not have a deep knowledge of <br/>
metal processing, we should rather use the term Shoki Kinko, 'the <br/>
first kinko period', for this type of work.  Other ideas about the <br/>
origin of these objects can be oriented from the beginnings of the <br/>
fire gilding technique in China, during the T'ang dynesty (618-906), <br/>
and the possible use of imported Chinese bronze for the production of <br/>
sword decoration.<br/>
The basic metal used for these objects is different from the metal <br/>
usually used for sword decoration.  An examination of the metal <br/>
content of this pair of menuki was performed in April 1996, by Prof. <br/>
Dr. Richter of the Institut fur technologie der Malerei, in <br/>
Stuttgart, using LASER micro spectral analysis and atomic absorption <br/>
spectral anallysis.   The main componenets of the metal in this <br/>
object are 70% copper, 25% silver, and the remaining 5% shows traces <br/>
of lead, gold, mercury iron, calcium magnesium, aluninum, and <br/>
silicon.  The gold and mercury derive from the fire gilding.  The <br/>
other contents can be taced to the partially refined copper.  An <br/>
alloy of 25% silver and 75% copper is often used for Japanese sword <br/>
decoration and is called oborogin.  With a higher percentage of <br/>
silver to copper the alloy is called rogin or more commonly <br/>
shibuichi.  For the outome of the alloy, it is important to know that <br/>
when silver is added to copper in these quantities, it tends to rise <br/>
to the surface, which is the reason for the silvery appearance of the <br/>
Shoki Kinko pieces.  It is not clear yet why especially this alloy <br/>
was used for sword decoration at such an early time.  These objects <br/>
are mostly deated from the early to middle Muromachi period (1400 - <br/>
1450), sometimes even earlier.  Shibuichi was always considered to be <br/>
a metal of the Edo period, but the date of origin of oborogin is <br/>
unknown.  Further analyses of the so coalled Shoki Kinko decarations <br/>
are necessary before any conclusion can be made about the components <br/>
of these sword fittings.  With this first analyses an important and <br/>
stimulating step was made towards further studies of this subject.<br/>
<br/>
Buttweiler in his writing stated he felt the dark color under the <br/>
gilding may have been due to the effect of mercury on the copper in <br/>
combination with the gold creating a layer of 'shakudo' and this <br/>
effect may have led t it's discovery as an alloy.  (This gilding was <br/>
post probably done by making a slurry paste of gold filings and <br/>
mercury and then heat evaporating the mercury leaving the gold layer).<br/>
<br/>

not unlike shibuichi but the books always say 'yamagane',  but I have <br/>
never seen this silvery metal on anything other than Ezo items.<br/>

<h3>Mino Tsuba</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1851610538">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
Picked this up from Germany.  It is a beautiful Mino<br/>
Shakudo Tsuba.  I believe the kogai ana is filled with<br/>
copper.  It has nice nanako.  The edge is completely<br/>
filled with leaves and flowers,etc.  The only really<br/>
weird thing is that the seppa-dai must have be put on<br/>
a pole weapon or something.  It has notches put in and<br/>
the nakaga ana has been widened.  Questions, where<br/>
would you classify this?  I was thinking mid-edo,  but<br/>
what would you look for in ko-mino work?   I have been<br/>
looking for a piece like this for a long time and I<br/>
think I did well on the purchase.  Comments please<br/>
(good and bad). <br/>

I think it looks more like having been used as a doorknob escutcheon in Germany!!  Note the circular impression above the "hole" where it was possibly mounted.  I heard somewhere years ago that in Paris many tsuba were used in this way, complete with nail holes where they were fixed to doors.  A mate of mine has a beautiful shibuichi wakizashi tsuba with a similar, but smaller hole.  It was fitted to an umbrella...<br/>

The tsuba is a Nagoya-mono from Owari, as the metal is brown and not true shakudo it is from the later period, one feature commonly found on Nagoya work are the 4 'chips', 2 each out of the sides of the nakago-ana at the top and bottom .<br/>

The tsuba might be from a yari blade mounted as a tanto or wakizashi.<br/>

<h3>Lost / Stolen Sword</h3>

Hi All, I am desperately seeking help to recover a sword that went <br/>
missing on Monday 06 June on a flight between London and New York (JFK). <br/>
The blade in question was appraised in London and given probable <br/>
attribution as an Oei-Bizen tachi in the form of the late Heian period, <br/>
possibly to one of the "Oei no San Mitsu"<br/>
<br/>
The blade measures 66 cm with 2.7 cm koshi sori and ko-kissaki. The <br/>
hamon is a very narrow suguha which continues through the boshi and <br/>
finishes in a small kaeri. The blade is suriage with a mumei nakago <br/>
showing the sori of the original length and with three mekugiana. The <br/>
blade is not in full polish but good condition with no rust or fatal <br/>
flaws. It does have two very slight bends through the monouchi area. <br/>
Photos available at the following link.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone, particularly in and around London or NY, hears of or sees a <br/>
blade of this desription I would really appreciate hearing from you.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, p+++ed off in Chile.<br/>

Interesting, Are these classified as shiirimono?  It<br/>
still seems that this tsuba has a lot of handiwork in<br/>
it and looks well done?<br/>

Thanks,<br/>

<h3>Announcing NEW and Exciting Website from the Mantis Dude</h3>
by <i>kdw21620</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1269611303">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
I was waiting to announce this since I was expecting 1<br/>
more tsuba to come in, but I can't wait anymore.  I<br/>
took a week of playing and made myself a website.  The<br/>
website is of my collection, including information on<br/>
symbolism of the praying mantis in fittings.  <br/>
<br/>
www.freewebs.com/kamakiriken/index.htm<br/>
<br/>
Please feel free to comment, add, help, etc with<br/>
anything. Milt didn't like the color scheme, but I<br/>
ignored that, however I was surprised to learn I was<br/>
using green since I thought it was grey (a little<br/>
color blind)<br/>
<br/>
I am kind of proud of myself, since inspite of having<br/>
no programs to edit pictures other than XEview and<br/>
microsoft paint, and no website programs, I was able<br/>
to put this together with basic knowledge of html.  I<br/>
taught myself html 8 years ago, but really never used<br/>
it.  It was somewhat fun to go through my collection<br/>
and document my pieces.  I had already took pictures<br/>
for my records so I had the pictures of my items. <br/>
Just had to upload it.  Lots of free stuff out there<br/>
to use on the internet.<br/>
<br/>
Hope you enjoy it and any help or additional<br/>
information would be helpful, just email me.  Thanks<br/>
to previewers for their comments.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for looking (in advance).<br/>
Ken "THE MANTIS DUDE"<br/>
