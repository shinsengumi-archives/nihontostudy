Here's the " can you handle the truth " version of the Tampa show<br/>
..............<br/>
<br/>
location...........great, no hassle about airport transportation etc. <br/>
etc.<br/>
but you all know that already.<br/>
<br/>
Weather......... great the first day, second day it freaking rained <br/>
on us !!<br/>
It's fun to see all the old timers smoke chimneys huddled under the <br/>
stairwell<br/>
by the pool cracking old jokes.<br/>
Last day it's cold and the eastern seaboard states are all snowed<br/>
in............... have fun, boys from the east getting home on time.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
events.............  Jim's lecture and exhibition of Akasaka tsuba is <br/>
greaaatttttttttttt ( quoting Tony the tiger, god bless his soul ).The <br/>
NBTHK oversea branch exhitbition of swords and kantei ( open to all ) <br/>
is excellent. I did not attempt the kantei as I don't want to <br/>
embarrass myself even though i would hit one right on ( the owner <br/>
told me  his juyo Ko-Mihara would be there ). Then there's the <br/>
oshigata lesson, the demonstration of the clay thingie on swords ( <br/>
hey, i am more of a fitting guy, can't recall the proper sword term <br/>
anymore ) etc......<br/>
<br/>
 Buying and selling................. buyers' market, no question <br/>
about it !!<br/>
If you carry cash and ready to part with them, great bargains <br/>
everywhere !!<br/>
Problem is most are freaking cheap................ or they all drop <br/>
their loads<br/>
by Hagrid's ( aka the big guy Mark walberg ) table who has boxes and <br/>
boxes ( I kid you<br/>
not ) of kodogu of the highest calibre ( and the price , though high, <br/>
is<br/>
reasonable ).<br/>
Mantis dude, i took a pic of a mantis tsuba from Hagrid's table just <br/>
for<br/>
you...............I think the asking price is in the mid 2k.<br/>
I personally marked my tsuba below retail and managed to sell only <br/>
two tsuba<br/>
in the higher mid range level and traded away a bunch of low end <br/>
tsuba for<br/>
somethings I can live with. So i consider the show as " slow " but I <br/>
do know<br/>
a friend sold a few high end tsuba so the show is good in his <br/>
prospective.<br/>
<br/>
Foods................... the exhibitor's dinner on Saturday can only <br/>
be<br/>
described as " strange ".............<br/>
I wonder how our dear friends from Deustchland enjoyed the true " <br/>
southern<br/>
cooking " that include black eye peas und collar greens !!??<br/>
<br/>
Jss/us business................ at least 10 new collectors signed up <br/>
as new<br/>
members at the show all due to the effort of one diector from Canada <br/>
( in<br/>
matters of hours ) !!<br/>
The society will be publishing Yoshikawa Sensei's writing ( <br/>
translated by<br/>
Prof. Gordon Robson ) in 3 volumes all priced at cost !!<br/>
An excellent article by our John Berta on Onin tsuba will be <br/>
published in<br/>
the upcoming journal, on top of that out dear friend from Deustchland <br/>
Hans has<br/>
, most generously , gave us permission to reprint his article on Yagyu<br/>
tsuba. Considered what he ate on Saturday night, I wondered how he <br/>
can still<br/>
be<br/>
so nice..............may be it's because I personally asked him ? Or <br/>
may be he<br/>
had private dinner with carl who told me he had lobster with wine <br/>
sauce<br/>
prepared just for him at the hotel ?? Arrrrrrrrrrhhhhhhhhhh, life is<br/>
soooooooooooo unfair !!<br/>
<br/>
that's about all I can think about just now.<br/>
For the " serious version " of the event, wait for the Ombudsman's <br/>
report.<br/>
<br/>
p.s. also learned a new trick from one of the old timer...... when <br/>
checking Goto school kozuka, run your finger nail under the " <br/>
picture " side of the opening......if it catches, not a good sign.<br/>
