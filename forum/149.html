<h3>kodogu translation</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1137460520">I bought a couple lower end pieces while in Japan because I liked the<br/>
composition. Now I'm screwing around with the mei.<br/>
<br/>
The first is a tsuba that I read as Hiro Yuki and the third character<br/>
escapes me.<br/>
<br/>
The second I was told was Nara Toshichi... when I look up those<br/>
characters for the mei though on the left, I get Toshi, and an alternate<br/>
Toshi. The last is a cao?<br/>
<br/>
Can someone shed some light on this for me?<br/>

The signatures didn't mean too much for me because as I said, they were<br/>
purchased for their nice composition and I would like to use them in<br/>
koshirae but I am interested in learning a bit more if possible.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

The first one is Hiroyuki with a kao.  There are several makers listed with that name.<br/>
<br/>
The second is Nara Toshi (Naga?) followed by a kao.  I'm not seeing the second character on the left very well, but if you're seeing it as the other "toshi," that kanji can also be read Naga and there are a number of makers signing that way including the Nara Toshinaga of sansaku fame.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Supposing this is not gimei for some reason, I guess the kao would help<br/>
tell them apart? There is an overall feeling of newness to this as well,<br/>
so I would think that the maker would be working in the 1800s. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Robertson character 187 is the one, most definitely and beyond a doubt<br/>
in person. I couldn't get it to stand out very well on the scan, I've<br/>
been sorting out various things since coming back from Japan so I didn't<br/>
put a lot of effort into getting a good clear one.<br/>
<br/>
Reading it as naga is news to me though, thanks for the tip, I will do<br/>
some digging. I don't have much in the way of documentation for kodogu,<br/>
but I saw something for a Toshinaga, none for Hiroyuki though.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks very much!<br/>
