<h3>Sad news...Ralph Bell</h3>
by <i>sworddad</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1776970653">To All - <br/>
<br/>
A phone call and also the following email received today brought the tragic news of Ralph Bell's sudden death, yesterday. As Fred wrote, it will take awhile for this to sink in, but those who knew Ralph and those who know him from the San Francisco show and other shows would want to know about this. <br/>

<br/>
Hello,<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This is by far the most difficult email I have ever had to write.  Today is a black day indeed as we lost our dear friend, Ralph Bell.  The world is a sadder place today.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I just received a phone call from his wife, Theresa, and she told me that yesterday afternoon while he was returning from fishing, he lost control of his truck and was thrown to his death.  I really do not have any further details as the exact cause of death will not be forthcoming until after an autopsy is done tomorrow.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The most important thing we can do for the family at this time is NOT call Theresa.  She is dealing with this tragedy with the family and does not need to go over the story multiple times.  She has requested that all calls go through me.  My home number is 650-595-1703.  I will follow up with further emails as more information is forthcoming.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The full ramifications of this event has not sunk in yet and I am sure it will take awhile for each of you to believe it also.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Please contact any collectors who knew Ralph and pass the word along.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
For those of you who would like to send a card to Ralph's family here is his address:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Theresa Bell<br/>
650 Calle de la Plata<br/>
Sparks, NV 89436<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Take care and say a prayer for the family tonight.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Fred<br/>

<h3>Re: Sad news...Ralph Bell   // Condolences</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-14976274">Dear Ron,<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for letting us know. He was a fixture of the<br/>
Nihonto Shows (San Fran, Tampa, Chicago) and it is<br/>
hard to imagine the shows without him.<br/>
<br/>
Condolences to Theresa, and to Fred for the sudden<br/>
loss of his good friend. <br/>
<br/>
