The story I remember is that menuki are vestigial ornaments from pre-Heian times<br/>
when the tsuka was fixed to the nakago with a rivet that was not removable.  The<br/>
heads of the rivet were decorated and eventually became the menuki we know<br/>
today.  What I did not know until these emails is that some menuki have<br/>
"interlocking pins" to become mekugi.  Sure, I've seen these on cheap Meiji<br/>
pieces, especially tanto, but didn't know early Goto menuki had the same<br/>
feature.  We can clearly see that as the Nihonto developed from earliest times<br/>
the disadvantage of a fixed rivet became evident, but the early menuki discussed<br/>
appear to have still functioned as a mekugi, only later becoming separate with a<br/>
bamboo mekugi, or mekugi of other material (iron??).  I also remember that in<br/>
the Momoyama period a single menuki was used, accounting for some of the<br/>
"orphans" we see.  Looking back over my collecting career I think I once had a<br/>
single (i.e., never a pair) shakudo menuki of a pomegranate.  It was of that<br/>
really dark black shakudo.  Sometimes knowledge comes too late to save us from<br/>
ourselves!!!<br/>
<br/>
Ken, I do have somewhere a late 19th century English treatise on the Goto<br/>
mainline (Shirobei 17 generations) with photos, but it doesn't go into the<br/>
"secret marks"...  Does anyone know the title of the Japanese one that Ken<br/>
mentions??<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1705678136">Hi all,<br/>
Having the book and seeing all the text with diagrams<br/>
pointing to marks on a menuki, makes me almost crazy<br/>
in not being able to read what they are saying.  Of<br/>
course, not crazy enough to actually learn japanese<br/>
like some you do.  <br/>
<br/>
FYI for those that want to know about the book some<br/>
more, the first section is all pics of the 17<br/>
generations work.  then it gets into text what I<br/>
assume is detailing a bit about each generation and<br/>
how you can tell it was them. Has diagrams and you can<br/>
tell some things like one generation used a rounded<br/>
edge etc,.  I would push for a translation more if I<br/>
really was collecting Goto work.  But since I don't<br/>
collect in that range usually ($$$$$$), there are so<br/>
many other books I want info on.  Of course I did<br/>
acquire 1 nice Goto mantis piece recently (most likely<br/>
Kaga Goto). Haven't seen a Mantis Goto menuki yet. <br/>
Some beautiful work though, amazing detail.  <br/>
<br/>
Then of course there are all the side groups who<br/>
worked in similiar style and at times did more<br/>
interesting work as the Goto school was very rigid in<br/>
what they did (ok I read that in one of those books<br/>
out there).  Does anyone know of any articles on Kaga<br/>
goto?  I know there is the Kaga takain, but at around<br/>
$700- 800, I'm not in the market for it.  Gotta go the<br/>
"hidden fortress" is on IFC- great samurai movie.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-888890022">Hi - <br/>
<br/>
Honestly, I could never get too excited about the premise that menuki posts were ever made to serve as mekugi except for what you wrote, Barry, about early, early tsuba being rivited with the heads decorated possibly being forerunners of menuki as we know them today. But of course, I have no "other" explanation for the "male/female" posts. I do find it interesting to note that the "primary" menuki usually has the "male/solid" post whereas the "secondary" menuki has the "female/hollow" post. (Primary one would be fitted to the omote/outside of the tsuka; the secondary would be on the ura side.) Make one wonder if perhaps there is some "other" meaning behind the use of male/female menuki posts. <br/>
<br/>
As for the "secret marks" of Goto, I'm not positive but it seems Jim Gilbert remarked about this section of the book awhile back, saying -- something like -- the idea of secret marks is not exactly true. Hope I'm not saying this incorrectly, but something like that. I too, have always wondered about that section of the book in hopes of "learning the key to identifying Goto works! Maybe that section just presents this idea in an overly simplified, general way?<br/>

  The story I remember is that menuki are vestigial ornaments from pre-Heian times<br/>
  when the tsuka was fixed to the nakago with a rivet that was not removable.  The<br/>
  heads of the rivet were decorated and eventually became the menuki we know<br/>
  today.  What I did not know until these emails is that some menuki have<br/>
  "interlocking pins" to become mekugi.  Sure, I've seen these on cheap Meiji<br/>
  pieces, especially tanto, but didn't know early Goto menuki had the same<br/>
  feature.  We can clearly see that as the Nihonto developed from earliest times<br/>
  the disadvantage of a fixed rivet became evident, but the early menuki discussed<br/>
  appear to have still functioned as a mekugi, only later becoming separate with a<br/>
  bamboo mekugi, or mekugi of other material (iron??).  I also remember that in<br/>
  the Momoyama period a single menuki was used, accounting for some of the<br/>
  "orphans" we see.  Looking back over my collecting career I think I once had a<br/>
  single (i.e., never a pair) shakudo menuki of a pomegranate.  It was of that<br/>
  really dark black shakudo.  Sometimes knowledge comes too late to save us from<br/>
  ourselves!!!<br/>
<br/>
  Ken, I do have somewhere a late 19th century English treatise on the Goto<br/>
  mainline (Shirobei 17 generations) with photos, but it doesn't go into the<br/>
  "secret marks"...  Does anyone know the title of the Japanese one that Ken<br/>
  mentions??<br/>

  Yes, I believe that at one point the menuki where<br/>
  "interlocking" with each other, at least on some<br/>
  styles of sword mounting design.  I can't remember<br/>
  what I had read about it, but I think this was the<br/>
  combo of the mekugi-ana and the menuki, but overtime<br/>
  the menuki and peg seperated and served different<br/>
  roles.  ok I took a stab at it, now someone can<br/>

	I have to say that I too have heard that the male-female post was a  <br/>
residual from the original "decorated mekugi head". In the late-Edo  <br/>
when they started reproducing old koshirae styles this type of mekugi  <br/>
was seen again but most often with a screw in feature.<br/>
	The section on secret marks is nothing of the sort. As I understand  <br/>
it, it is a detailed explanation of the chisel work seen in  <br/>
individual artists. It shows close ups of fine detail on toes,  <br/>
feathers, scales and claws, showing how some of the masters put the  <br/>
finishing touches on their work. If these marks are present and done  <br/>
in a certain way you have evidence that it may be the work of a  <br/>
certain master. If they are not present then maybe you do not. They  <br/>
are all visible however, not hidden in any way, one just has to  <br/>
recognize the workmanship.<br/>
	and before anybody asks, I haven't done more than browse thru it, I  <br/>
don't want to translate it and I don't know any secrets...<br/>

 </span></blockquote>-t, Trickie et al,<br/>
the title is :" Kinko Kantei Hiketsu" , volume 1 and 2 bound as one <br/>
book.<br/>
Writer's name........... Yoshiaki Noda.<br/>
Printer....... Tomohiro Takase<br/>
printed date......... Bunsei 3 ( 1820 ).<br/>
<br/>
I am thinking either scan the pages or take digital pics and send to <br/>
jss/us as a serial article .<br/>
Editor wants me to do translation of the text which I cannot do and <br/>
that's what holding me back.<br/>
Tom, if you are willing , we can have a " joint effort ", I send you <br/>
the pics and you do the translation...........<br/>
Vol.1 is like a pattern book while vol.2 title is " top secret " ( I <br/>
kid you not ), it has detail drawings of various part, like how many <br/>
strokes on the dragon belly etc.<br/>
We don't have to do every page but selected pages, what say you ?<br/>

the Goto and their "Cryptic chisels"<br/>
