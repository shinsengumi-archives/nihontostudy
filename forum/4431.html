<h3>Just For Fun</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1991537151">As we all know, the European and American Art Nouveau school of the<br/>
late nineteenth century was much based on the art disseminated from a<br/>
recently trade opened Japan.  I collect old sterling and coin silver,<br/>
generally pre-1850, but am open to picking up a later piece now and<br/>
then if it has nice handwork (as opposed to the more typical punch<br/>
press garp).  I just landed this small (5 inch) Victorian sugar sifter<br/>
ladle by Walter and John Barnard of London.  The pierced and hand<br/>
engraved theme is ginko, I believe, very Japanese in flavor and not<br/>
typical of most occidental Art Nouveau (usually leaned more toward<br/>
acanthus).  While not up to Japanese standards, the work here isn't<br/>
all that bad, and the piece was in my price range (cheep! cheep!<br/>
cheep!).  Note that much of western-made Japanese-style Art Nouveau<br/>
metal work, particularly mixed metal, generally costs much more than<br/>
the equivalent type (and much superior quality) authentic Japanese<br/>
work (well, IMO).  <br/>
