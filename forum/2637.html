It's "Nobuie Tsuba Shu," 1926, Nakamura Kakudayu & Akiyama Kyusaku.<br/>
<br/>
Or the reprint with supplemental material from 1981, published by Token Shunju Shinbunsha, Tokyo.<br/>
<br/>
Not all currently recognized Nobuie tsuba are illustrated, but they're great books.<br/>

  He<br/>
  collected dozens and dozens of oshigata of Nobuiye, some very<br/>
  unassuming, as was the found one I refereed to, and they were published<br/>
  by a Mr. Nakayama, or Nakamura or something close to that (only my poor<br/>
  brain as a reference here). <br/>
