<div id="ygrps-yiv-231128012">Hi all - <br/>
<br/>
Just trying to identify the place name on this interesting shinto wakizashi by Kaga Kiyohira. I've placed a scan of this inscription in Yahoo photos, my album Ron STL, photo: oite Kiyohira what. <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://tinyurl.com/q4uz2">http://tinyurl.com/q4uz2</a><br/>
<br/>
This smith apparently moved around a lot but I can't figure out just where he was when he signed this particular sword. Any clues???  Thanks!<br/>

<br/>
Your Kiyohira place name reads Ejou, which I would think is a reference to<br/>
Edo castle, E being the first character from Edo and jou, meaning castle.<br/>

	I think this is an (expletive) cool signature, looking at other  <br/>
smiths working in Edo, Edo-jo does not seem to be used in any  <br/>
signatures. According to the Meikan the first generation worked in  <br/>
Edo but this particular signature (place name) is not given. So it  <br/>
may be a unique signature.<br/>
	Could he have forged this within the castle as diversion for his  <br/>
lord or others? Could it have been for one of the sword-making  <br/>
contests known to have taken place at the Shoguns behest. Was he on  <br/>
duty (bivouac-ed) at the castle but forged this at the Kaga mansion  <br/>
or some other spot in the castle-town? I think it raises some  <br/>
intriguing questions and is a good subject of study.<br/>
	As for preserving it, "every sword deserves a good polish", and if  <br/>
they made it this far it is up to us to preserve them, if we cannot  <br/>
get the best polish available then it is incumbent on us to stop any  <br/>
deterioration, and keep it in as is condition for future generations  <br/>
to restore.<br/>
