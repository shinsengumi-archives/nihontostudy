After asking about this subject I did locate a couple references to the owl motif, both very dark and negative as you pointed out. One called the owl the "messenger of the devil!" Thinking about this, I wonder why the owl would had been used on kodogu, specifically menuki, unless of course it was to imply death from the sword, or something like that. (Seems the poor old owl is getting a bad rap! Neat bird!)  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-9030455">Hi - <br/>
<br/>
I found a brief explanation in Joly's "Legend in Japanese Art" on p.43 but could find nothing elsewhere in the book about owls. (You need the Japanese name for "owl" to find it, if it exists.)<br/>
<br/>
In the 2-volume set "Tsuba" and "Kodogu" by (I think) H.U.B. Velag--German publication from a few years ago--the Kodogu volume shows a kozuka (KO-51) with an owl being used as falcon bait, and a kogai (K-11)showing an owl on a tree branch. Each item has a description of the design explaining the evilness of the owl (poor guy). <br/>
<br/>
This is all I could find here.<br/>

Editor of the Newsletter at the time, I recall the author(s) placing a one-time ad in the Newsletter offering their index for, I think, around fifty bucks.

    Hi David - <br/>
<br/>
    After asking about this subject I did locate a couple references to the owl motif, both very dark and negative as you pointed out. One called the owl the "messenger of the devil!" Thinking about this, I wonder why the owl would had been used on kodogu, specifically menuki, unless of course it was to imply death from the sword, or something like that. (Seems the poor old owl is getting a bad rap! Neat bird!)  <br/>

      I have found it necessary recently to lay in some references on the subject to satisfy my own curiosity:<br/>
<br/>
      Hibi Sadao and Niwa Motoji, "Snow, Wave, Pine -- Traditional Patterns in Japanese Design," Kodansha, 2001.<br/>
<br/>
      Merrily Brand, "Symbols of Japan -- Thematic Motifs in Art and Design," Rizzoli, 2001.<br/>
<br/>
      I have a third out-of-print title on order.<br/>
<br/>
      Hibi & Niwa do not discuss the owl.<br/>
<br/>
      Baird (113-114) writes:<br/>
<br/>
      "OWL. The owl figured prominently in the artistic symbolism of the ancient Chinese, who seemed to have viewed the nocturnal bird as capable of making the realm of night and darkness safer.  With the passage of time, the owl's apparent role as mediator of the world of darkness waned, however, and it came to be viewed with dread.  Moreover, there arose the belief in China that owlets devoured their mothers, and the bird thereby became a symbol of filial betrayal.  It was these later, negative associations that crossed from China to Japan.  Because the owl (_fukuro_) is generally considered evil, and an omen of death, it only rarely appears on personal and household objects in Japan.     <br/>

        Hi - <br/>
<br/>
        Looking at some menuki depicting (I think) a male and female owl sitting in a pine tree (branch). Realized I never really understood the meaning of the "owl" and thought somebody might jump in here and explain it for all to learn from.<br/>

Here's another information  on owls which i bet very few people can dig out <br/>
from any books.................<br/>
From what I understand  the owls are used as " medicinal foods " to cure bed <br/>
wetting.<br/>
I kid you not.............. just ask any old folks in any Asian  food markets <br/>
in the old countries ( by that I mean Singapore, Hong Kong, China, <br/>
Korea..........may  be Japan  by extrapolation since there's tremendous <br/>
cultural/culinary exchange ).<br/>

I also did some google searching on the Japanese word for owl, fukurou.  I found some toys claiming the owl as a symbol of good luck, but I have a feeling that these modern associations have more to do with marketing than historical accuracy.<br/>
<br/>
In books and web I mostly found the negative meanings already posted, but these didn't make much sense in relation to sword mountings.  (Unless maybe as a memento mori type reminder that you might have to kill your own family members to get ahead.  True in the 16th C, but maybe not a very popular idea in the Confucian-minded Edo period.)<br/>
<br/>
In Katherine Ball's "Decorative Motives of Oriental Art" I found a brief mention of the owl being noted for the ability to kill birds its own size.  In addition to the fierce hawks and occasional rooster, the first Jingo made at least one tsuba with an owl motif.  I suspect that the intended meaning of the owl may have been along the same lines of courage and martial spirit.<br/>
<br/>
I didn't find any exact homonyms for fukurou, but there are two kanji pronounced fukuro that mean "a return trip."  No idea if that was intended, but returning home alive could certainly be an auspicious association.<br/>
<br/>
Oddly I can't find fukurou listed in Tsuba Kodogu Gaidai Jiten.  <br/>

I found a tsuba with owl motif  by Nobuie, it's illustrated in that <br/>
exhibition catalog  ( page 63 ).<br/>
I can't translate the title of the catalog accurately.....it's something like <br/>
Nihonto kodogu research society ( museum opening commemorative )<br/>
