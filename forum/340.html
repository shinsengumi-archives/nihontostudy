<h3>bad tsuba pics, part deux...</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1722079315">Hey guys,<br/>
<br/>
After seeing Matt's message about the nebulous crane tsuba I realized I <br/>
had some good pics for comparison of<br/>
photographic techniques on tsuba...<br/>
<br/>
These were either shot with my ancient acer scanner or my Canon G2 <br/>
(color balance adusted by shooting a graycard).<br/>
<br/>
This first picture is using my standard "shoot on glass over 18% gray <br/>
background with skimlight (and several white<br/>
cards used for additional lighting to the rim all the way around...)" <br/>
picture.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I had gotten a couple of complaints aobut how the rim was "washed out <br/>
(funny, I had started taking these this way<br/>
because that's how they were shown in Sasano's last book, but I <br/>
digress), so I reshot the tsuba using a samigon<br/>
fluorescent ring light on the G2<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
The tsuba was laid on a graycard for this photo<br/>
<br/>
Just out of curiosity, I also shot the piece using my scanner with the <br/>
lid open (the way I used to do this<br/>
before I got the G2):<br/>

<br/>
this probably could have benefitted from maybe a slight increase in <br/>
brightness (plus the resolution is less than optimal<br/>
due to my hurried reduction in size for this diatribe...)<br/>
<br/>
The next picture is the tsuba with a white background (NOTE: I might <br/>
have increased the brightness slightly - I did this<br/>
a couple of weeks ago and didn't keep any notes - usually they look <br/>
about as bad as pics of the tsuba that Matt had<br/>
queried the list about):<br/>

<br/>
As you can see, the color is too dark, and you can't see much of the <br/>
surface detail (typical ebay picture, right? :-) )<br/>
<br/>
This final picture is the same scanned picture with the brightness <br/>
cranked waaaay up (+43 or so in photoshop)<br/>

<br/>
this was done on the higher resolution original - don't try this trick <br/>
at home on an ebay pic - it gets pretty<br/>
garly since nobody ever stores enough bits to do much with...  In any <br/>
case, you can mostly see everything, and the<br/>
color is kind of correct....<br/>
<br/>
So, for a bonus question, which style do you guys think looks the best:<br/>
