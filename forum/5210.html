<h3>New fittings publication available</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-659012296">Hi all - <br/>
<br/>
Perhaps this has already been mention but if so, it's worth bringing to your attention again. <br/>
<br/>
Many of you have already purchased the 2005 and 2006 exhibition catalogues of the Kokusai Tosogu Kai (KTK). (With no formal exhibit set up in 2007, no catalogue was published this year.) The 2005 catalogue was an excellent publication of high quality. Being our group's first effort, many of the items exhibited that year by American members did not make it into that year's catalogue. To remedy this, a "supplement" to the 2005 KTK catalogue was planned, one that would include photographs and descriptions of all the many items exhibited in 2005 but not included in the catalogue. A time consuming undertaking, the supplement has now been completed and is available through LuLu.com for the very reasonable price of $50 plus shipping. Check it out:<br/>

There has been little information written about our fittings study group, Kokusai Tosogu Kai (KTK), so many of you probably wonder what it is all about. The KTK is a private study group of some 40 members, internationally. The purpose of the KTK is to study tosogu as a small group of serious collectors, and to promote research. The KTK is fortunate to have access to a number of significant collections of tosogu, especially in Japan, thanks to a number of private collector/members. As a means of sharing what is studied and the research that follows, the KTK attempts to produce a high quality catalogue of what is brought to our annual conventions for study. An energetic and expensive undertaking, these catalogues are certainly worthwhile (and reasonably priced) publications for one's sword library. This newly offered supplement to the 2005 KTK catalogue is definitely a publication not to be missed!<br/>

Are the 'annual conventions' open to the public? I will certainly<br/>
contact Lulu and purchase a copy of this supplemental catalog.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the 'heads-up'.<br/>
