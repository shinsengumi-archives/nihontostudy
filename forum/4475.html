<h3>Issei Naruki Bio request</h3>

<br/>
If anyone knows or has contacts in Japan who might<br/>
now, I would like to have (or assemble) a bio for a<br/>
modern tsuba-ko names Issei Naruki.<br/>
<br/>
He once lived in Mino (Gifu prefecture) and I'd like<br/>
to learn is birth date, if he is still alive, how his<br/>
work is regarded in Japan, etc.<br/>
   Replies off list are welcome.<br/>
<br/>
I have a rubbing of a poem by him on one of his tsuba.<br/>
I'd like to get it translated, but had no luck so far.<br/>
I suspect that might have been plagerized off a<br/>
Nobuiye tsuba, but have not yet found a an image of an<br/>
identical Nobuiye (just a similar one).<br/>
<br/>
Any and all help welcome.<br/>
<br/>
