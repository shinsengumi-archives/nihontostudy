<h3>auction ripoff</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2073057854">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
I just wanted to warn anyone bidding on auctions to be careful of total ripoff <br/>
shipping policies.  Bonhams in England quoted me a price of 141 english pounds <br/>
to ship 1 regular tsuba.  I got a quote from mailbox etc which is around 100 and <br/>
that is still disgusting.  I know it costs about $20 usd  say around 15 pounds <br/>
to ship.  I emailed when I got the original quote and said you must be <br/>
mistaken.  They said that quote is correct, they use an outside vendor but the <br/>
item will be delivered to my doorstop.  where else would it be delivered to?  I <br/>
figured at those prices if they have  5-6 customers in NY they could actually <br/>
send a person by plane to hand deliver.  I am debating what to do, but since I <br/>
haven't gotten a response back asking to speak to a person in charge, it looks <br/>
like I won't be a customer of theirs ever again.  I am a strong believer in <br/>
providing customer service but when an action like this occurs, it just shows me <br/>
they don't really care.  3rd party or not you as a company are responsible for <br/>
the entire experience.  If they chose the vendor, it is still part of their <br/>
service.  I am just amazed at how much of a ripoff is being allowed to go on.  <br/>
So be warned and be careful, a company I thought was reputable is a place I <br/>
don't think is acting in a reputable manner.<br/>
<br/>
Hope all of you have better experiences.<br/>

I read your e-mail about the shipping charges from Bonhams for the tsuba purchase. You might want to consider whether a London based collector could do you a favor, pick up and ship the tsuba to you.  I would suggest finding out from Bonhams how someone could be authorized to get the tsuba and then inquiring on the Nihonto message board if someone would  be willing,<br/>

 <br/>
many auction houses work the same way even here in the States where shipping is concerned. Collectors I know resort to doing as Dale suggests, find a trustworthy local 3rd party. <br/>
