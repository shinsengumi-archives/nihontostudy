<h3>&quot;swashtika&quot; Mon / Buddhist symbol in Kodogu</h3>

<br/>
A while back a newbie posted a question about<br/>
'Swashtika' mon tsuba and whether his wife's purchase<br/>
for him was a hong kong crapper. He couldn't provide a<br/>
photo, so we couldn't confirm- though evidence pointed<br/>
towards it. Several of us had seen this design used in<br/>
brass hong kongers recently.<br/>
<br/>
Just revisiting the topic openly, -becuase I can't<br/>
find the newbie's email-, here are 2 things that<br/>
popped up and seem to me quite legit.<br/>
<br/>
Tsuba from Benson (dead ringer for the design newbie<br/>
drew)<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.bushidojapaneseswords.com/4montsuba.htm">http://www.bushidojapaneseswords.com/4montsuba.htm</a><br/>
<br/>
It has happened that modern kodogu slips through<br/>
Benson (I speak from personal experience, I doubt Bob<br/>
knew and the items were very good. They are the only<br/>
moderns I own.). This tsuba looks legit to me, and<br/>
most of what he sells is very good to excellent.<br/>
Anyone care to deconstruct this tsuba as not legit?<br/>
<br/>
Then this popped up on Aoi today:<br/>
("Jyuyo" tachi koshirae under the Sale section)<br/>
-swashtika- mon on the kojiri.<br/>
<br/>
Both are good examples of this. Its a belated<br/>
follow-up. Newbie-gent, you still out there and have a<br/>
photo of your tsuba to compare to Benson's?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2094769875">I would say it looks to fit into the Kyosukashi school.  I was looking <br/>
at it yesterday and it seems to be a nice piece.  The small kogaibitsu <br/>
would point toward an earlier piece. However, I suppose it could be an <br/>
1800's Bakamatsu period piece.   I don't have it in hand nor the <br/>
experience with metal types to make a qualified decision.  In any case <br/>
the price seems reasonable.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1217086645">Hi guys, those odd shaped Hitsu were also prevalent in the early Owari <br/>
works and I think that this could also fit into that school as well as <br/>
the Kyo and Shoami as Pete mentioned.  I think though that if this was <br/>
Owari or Kyo, it would be early Edo as opposed to Muromachi, though as <br/>
Pete also notes, with out the guard in hand, it is very hard to say.<br/>
