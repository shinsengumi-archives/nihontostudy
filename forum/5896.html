<div id="ygrps-yiv-2056503158">Two sword happenings are on the horizon and will be here before we know it!  Just curious if y'all made plans to attend these opportunities improve our knowledge of swords and fittings.<br/>
<br/>
Chicago show is the first event -- weekend of April 27th-29th. We need to support these shows otherwise they will die and we will be lost without them. Your support is of utmost importance!!!!<br/>

Then mid-May the Frazier Museum in Louisville, Kentucky will open their exhibit, Samurai, on May 12th thru September. What an opportunity to see some twenty great swords by the likes of Masamune, Hisakuni and others and many, many other artifacts from the age of the Samurai! A rare opportunity for those of us in midwestern America! Hope y'all manage a visit or two or three!  <br/>
