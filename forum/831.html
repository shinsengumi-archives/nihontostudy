<h3>Efu Tachi mounted Katana for sale</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-34965336">Hi Guys,<br/>
<br/>
I'll be listing this Efu Tachi mounted katana on ebay in a couple of <br/>
days.  We don't see these types of mounts very often - if ever <br/>
really.  The carving work is very intricate, and this is a pretty <br/>
old set.  The blade is very old with 4 holes in the nakago, it is <br/>
signed Yoshimitsu, but the signature has been welded on.  It also <br/>
has a few openings on the surface.<br/>
<br/>
I will have a more detailed description on ebay.  If you have any <br/>
questions please feel free to ask, I also have many pictures of it.<br/>
<br/>
Here is a link to some pictures:<br/>
