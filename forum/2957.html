<h3>Nihiki design ...</h3>
by <i>drjohnplissenden</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1169053572">Dear Members<br/>
<br/>
Can anybody please tell me what is meant by the term 'nihiki design'?  <br/>
It appears to refer to a tsuba design incorporating two rectangular <br/>
openings, one on each side of the seppa-dai, but I have never been <br/>
able to identify what, if anything, these represent.<br/>

<br/>
Ok, I have labelled this Akasaka but..... I am strongly starting to <br/>
think it could be Higo Nishigaki, Jim G, you said to have a good look as <br/>
it may well be something else ( other than Akasaka ) and I did. I knew <br/>
right off it didn't have the normal Akasaka mimi, and the edges are just <br/>
a little soft for the usual seen in akasaka, and it is probably just a <br/>
bit too thin in the mimi but that does not automatically rule it out, <br/>
the depth of the tsuba is also thin for Akasaka but again.......<br/>
<br/>
I think if not Akasaka then Higo is a good call ????? and maybe in <br/>
particular, Higo Nishigaki.<br/>
<br/>
Thought's, right or wrong ?????<br/>

Wow, that is interesting what they used to do it.  Someone suggested <br/>
something simular on one of my coin lists to repatinate the coins, and <br/>
they suggested using horse or cow dung and something like pee too.  I <br/>
don't know if they were serious or not, but I don't think anyone tryed <br/>
it. :-D<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-801284554">John,<br/>
If I am picturing it correctly, the rectangular openings are usually interpreted as representing measuring boxes (masu).  The design with two boxes is called sayu-masu (left and right boxes).    <br/>
<br/>
My Japanese language skills are minimal, but I only know of nihiki as the "counting word" used for two small animals. I asked my shodo teacher (first native speaker I remembered to ask) if she could think of any other meaning for nihiki or a way that it might relate to that motif, but no luck.  <br/>
<br/>
Do you know what the kanji are for that nihiki?  <br/>
<br/>
It just occurred to me to try a google image search on nihiki.  Most hits are photos of pairs of dogs, cats, rabbits, etc., but interestingly this jpg <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www005.upp.so-net.ne.jp/minbun/news/news21/nihiki.jpg">http://www005.upp.so-net.ne.jp/minbun/news/news21/nihiki.jpg</a><br/>
of a kimono turned up.  Kimono sleeves are normally called sode as far as I know, but the two rectangular sleeves would fit the two rectangle motif.  The nihiki  二引 in the caption I think refers to the kind of garment, but I don't know the meaning.  It's probably a red herring.  The source page is here:<br/>

I found the description on an advertisement for a tsuba on Tokugawa <br/>
Art.  This has two measuring boxes, one either side of the seppa-dai, <br/>
and is described as 'nihiki design'.<br/>

<br/>
I am not familiar with the term "hiki," and will have to look it up, but I<br/>
am pretty sure the "ni" part is two and the "hiki" part refers to the very<br/>
large hitsu-ana.<br/>

I pictured the ji-sukashi version, but this type in negative openwork with the elongated rectangles is often interpreted as a battle banners or as tanzaku "poem cards."  The square format writing card is called shikishi, but that is a long stretch from nihiki.<br/>

	Hiki is the counter for cloth. fine bolts <br/>
of silk cloth were given as presents. I am <br/>
begining to think this is two bolts of cloth BUT. <br/>
The Japanese website gives a different kanji (see <br/>
below) So I sent them an email to see what they <br/>
say it means...<br/>
