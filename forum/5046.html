<h3>SHIGEHARU - STUDENT OF TOSHINAGA II</h3>
by <i>xe83fan</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-11433719">Dear All,<br/>
<br/>
A friend of mine has a lovely fuchigashira by Shigeharu.  I'm a blade man and don't have so many fittings books, certainly not the "bibles", so I have trawled the web looking for info on Shigeharu and have found nothing so far.  Does anyone have any info on this artisan that they could post on the list??<br/>
<br/>
With thanks,<br/>

I've put three images of the Shigeharu in my "Barry Thomas" photo album - the fuchi, kashira and mei.  I'd be grateful for any and all information.<br/>

The Kinko Jiten lists 8 Shigeharus. Only one is said to use a two  <br/>
character signature and there is only the information that he is late  <br/>
Edo period.<br/>
