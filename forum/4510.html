Many an uneducated swordsman has, and many still do. The key is of<br/>
course recognition. Do many people recognize your style as having<br/>
practical, spiritual and cultural value, enough that your style will<br/>
continue long after your passing. Do otherwise uniterested parties<br/>
recognize what you are doing as Japanese Swordsmanship or at least<br/>
swordsmanship. Finally does the pioneer himself recognize the<br/>
contributions of past masters, and that it takes really big cahones to<br/>
pronounce to the world they have broken with tradition and started his<br/>
own way and how that might rub folks the wrong way no matter how good<br/>
or how logical his new style may be.<br/>
<br/>
you might go to the Iaido/l list at the University of Guelph, or<br/>
swordforum.com for some other opinions.<br/>
<br/>
You didn't ask but, my advice would be to align yourself with an<br/>
establish tradition, then work hard and if you're lucky enough, open<br/>
your own dojo. You get to teach what you like and you're students will<br/>
be part of something bigger than the backyard Ryuha. and for goodness<br/>
sakes if you aren't Japanese don't give it a Japanese name...<br/>
