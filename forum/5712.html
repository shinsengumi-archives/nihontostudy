I presume you are suggesting downgrading the jpg photos to smaller sizes.  I can do that; however, it does reduce the quality of detail.  Do you not have highspeed internet?<br/>
<br/>
I am thinking about reproducing the catalog, complete with Dad's notes and adding pages of the show pictures.  Do you think there is a market for a paper copy (~$40)?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-737884165">G'day Dean, so it is save back out as a Jpeg, just using a different <br/>
algorithm.<br/>
<br/>
XnView can be found here at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.xnview.com/en/index.html">http://www.xnview.com/en/index.html</a><br/>
<br/>
The first link is the download (*XnView (v1.97.7/1.70)* <br/>
<<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.xnview.com/en/xnview.html">http://www.xnview.com/en/xnview.html</a>>)<br/>
<br/>
Then using the second image (row of armour) as an example I just re <br/>
saved it with the default Jpeg settings (80%) and the file size went <br/>
from 2.8 meg to 480 K. Quite a difference. It is not as effective as <br/>
Photoshop but it's not bad, and I am sure the quality difference with be <br/>
almost non existent. Fiddling with the settings won't make a huge <br/>
difference.<br/>
<br/>
