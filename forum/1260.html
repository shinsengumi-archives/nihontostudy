It looks etched to me, similar to the late Hoan style.  I don't think it's modern.  Probably late Edo.  I can't make out the mei, but I'd like to know what it is.  There are a fair number of etched guards that are hard to place.  The signed examples of Hoan work with etched decoration that I've seen had the mei chiseled in the normal way, not etched with the decoration.  Anyone have a clue about the signature (or any better ideas)?<br/>

  acquired this big iron tsuba recently........<br/>
  it is signed, but since the mei is not chiseled, I think the mei + <br/>
  flower motif are " cast "or " etched ".......<br/>
  can anyone  read the mei ?  opinion as to jidai ( don't think it's <br/>
  modan )? school ?<br/>
