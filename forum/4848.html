<div id="ygrps-yiv-2026919248">I will be at the Tampa Show on Saturday and maybe Sunday. Following a large purchase Friday (now pending receipt), I've decided to bring 5 or 6 higher end items to put on a table for sale.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone care to share a table with me or sell me some space and an exhibitor badge for one of their table? ... Email me directly.<br/>
