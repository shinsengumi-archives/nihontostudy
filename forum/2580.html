<div id="ygrps-yiv-199511170">Someone was asking about when the reprint of Knutsen's book on polearms would be available.  I just got the below in an email from Paragon.  Amazon's price is the same.<br/>

This fully illustrated study of naginata and yari, the only reference of its kind in English, records the many variations of spear design from the ancient period when warrior chieftains settled in Japan from the Asian mainland, down to the fall of the Tokugawa in 1868 that marked the close of the feudal period. In addition, it offers the reader valuable insight into the historical attitude of the Japanese warrior to warfare and examples of how these often splendid weapons in the bujutsu - the arts of the battlefield. Item # 30321 ISBN 1901903567 (Global Oriental) Price: $50.00 <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-402524936">If I could also add, a reference to Roald Knutsen other "new" book "<br/>
Rediscovering Budo from a Swordsmans Perspective"  - although less on<br/>
weaponry information as is his Japanese Spears & Polearms - ... it is a<br/>
wonderful read and a great reference book on the roots/history and tradition<br/>
of Bujutsu & Budo from a person with a wealth of hands-on experience in<br/>
Japan of the swordsmans & warrior culture.<br/>
