<div id="ygrps-yiv-1839409089">Hi all, this site was bought to my attention and I found this Wak. Lovely little piece but I was particularly struck by the koshirae. I am guessing Goto,  I was discussing this with Barry Thomas and his guess was Mino Goto. Maybe Jim G could shed some light on it.<br/>
<br/>
I was also curious about the papers, would they be Seikeido's own kantei papers ?.<br/>

The fuchigashira are described in the text as mid Edo period Mino kinko, which is a safe call.  They look quite nice.  I can't see much of the other fittings.  It says that the tsuba is ko-Kinko.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1388729781">Hi Richard,<br/>
<br/>
The fuchi-kashira are MIno in style. Can't tell much about the menuki or the<br/>
tsuba, which appears to be iron. Kozuka is also difficult to tell much<br/>
about. Unfortunately, when my daughter was home the last time with her<br/>
boyfriend, they switched my internet connnection to Opera, which only reads<br/>
English, so I can't read the Japanese text.<br/>
On a slightly different note getting back to the use of Ko-Tosho and<br/>
Ko-Katchushi tsuba, I had mentioned Sasano's ideas about this. This morning<br/>
I took another look at his book Tosogu no Kigen or Origins of Sword Fittings<br/>
(actually, Katana Fittings). One of the illustrations he cites is the Ban<br/>
Daiagon scroll, which shows an elderly foot solider with an uchigatana that<br/>
has a tsuba. This scroll dates to the late Heian period. There are other<br/>
warriors with shorter blades -- koshigatana? -- that are without tsuba.<br/>
There is also a plain round iron tsuba that would be called a Ko-Tosho that<br/>
was mounted on a nagamaki. We know this because the seppa were rusted to the<br/>
tsuba and they are large and round of the type that would be for a nagamaki<br/>
handle. The tsuba is very large at 9.3 cent. across. Anyway, just thought I<br/>
would share this.<br/>

Look at the fellow in the upper left hand corner.  He is carrying an uchigatana with a tsuba, however it's rather difficult to say whether it might be made of iron, yamagane or leather.<br/>
<br/>
Gordon - do you have any sort of image of the nagamaki tsuba?  Is it a plain iron plate without sukashi?<br/>

  Hi Richard,<br/>
<br/>
  The fuchi-kashira are MIno in style. Can't tell much about the menuki or the<br/>
  tsuba, which appears to be iron. Kozuka is also difficult to tell much<br/>
  about. Unfortunately, when my daughter was home the last time with her<br/>
  boyfriend, they switched my internet connnection to Opera, which only reads<br/>
  English, so I can't read the Japanese text.<br/>
  On a slightly different note getting back to the use of Ko-Tosho and<br/>
  Ko-Katchushi tsuba, I had mentioned Sasano's ideas about this. This morning<br/>
  I took another look at his book Tosogu no Kigen or Origins of Sword Fittings<br/>
  (actually, Katana Fittings). One of the illustrations he cites is the Ban<br/>
  Daiagon scroll, which shows an elderly foot solider with an uchigatana that<br/>
  has a tsuba. This scroll dates to the late Heian period. There are other<br/>
  warriors with shorter blades -- koshigatana? -- that are without tsuba.<br/>
  There is also a plain round iron tsuba that would be called a Ko-Tosho that<br/>
  was mounted on a nagamaki. We know this because the seppa were rusted to the<br/>
  tsuba and they are large and round of the type that would be for a nagamaki<br/>
  handle. The tsuba is very large at 9.3 cent. across. Anyway, just thought I<br/>
  would share this.<br/>
<br/>
