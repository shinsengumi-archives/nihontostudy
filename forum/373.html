Just wanted folks to see an example that was different<br/>
than the norm we typically see from Higo and Shonai.<br/>
<br/>
P.S. I was amused to see the one you recalled<br/>
in Ginza Choshuya as late as March when I was there.<br/>
Priced at 850,000 JPY. Koshirae only.<br/>
I had sold the piece (with katana attributed<br/>
to Owari Seki) about 8 yrs. ago at a sword show<br/>
to a Japanese dealer. Small world.<br/>
