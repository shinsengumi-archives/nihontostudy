            page... a good mate in Japan. The link below is for that...
            Anyone able to help out?<br>

            Hi Swordfans, <br>
            <br>
            As we mentioned in an earlier post we are about to embark on
            a new exciting project of a regular sword video magazine on
            youtube. We are now an official Partner Channel, and have
            access to the Youtube Space, in Roppongi Hills, Tokyo. As
            with majority of free services we give to the public in our
            efforts that are "Dedicated to the Preservation and
            Promotion of Japanese Swords, Swordsmiths and Related
            Crafts", the Youtube "The Japanese Sword Video Magazine"
            will also be free. However. you will have to suffer the
            pesky ads (our apologies in advance). We do not ask for help
            often here, but as this is a sizable project involving the
            expertise from various people from different fields (music,
            animation, translators & subtitles, guests, guest
            directors, and editors, volunteers, etc) we need your help
            to ge<span class="ygrps-yiv-276439114text_exposed_show">t it off the ground!!
              We need specialist equipment, editing software, etc, etc.
              <br>
              <br>
              We will be starting a Kickstarter page in the near future
              with various sizes of Tamahagane as gifts (these will also
              apply to the wishlist-we make the promise here). We are
              aiming at first starting as a quarterly video magazine,
              then as the team comes together, we hope to post more
              frequently. Our segments will include educational items, a
              regular fittings koza/review by Ford Hallam of Following
              the iron brush, interviews with the many sword craftsmen
              and scholars working today, explanations of great swords
              by top Japanese scholars, top sword martial artists,
              reports on sword events and news in Japan, and from around
              the world. It is an chance to get a regular peek into the
              sword world. With your support, it could be an exciting
              project. In the meantime, we have started a wish list on
              Amazon. There are some relatively inexpensive items there
              too. We would be grateful for any help received. Also, we
              are looking for any equipment/advertising sponsors. Or, if
              you have any second hand equipment that suits our needs,
              we would be grateful for that too. <br>
              <br>
              Let's get swording!<br>
