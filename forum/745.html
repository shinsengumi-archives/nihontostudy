a few brass ten-zogan. The style of plate, sukashi,<br/>

<br/>
I just wonder if it not the quality of the steel that directed this call to Tembo over Saotome? Can't say this with too much authority but I would think Saotome plate would be thinner and of a better quality than Tembo. Will look forward to seeing what Jim and others will say about this. <br/>

Without having seen it in person, which like Ron said might yield additional important clues, I probably would have called it Saotome.  The style of the sukashi design and the ana are typical Saotome.  <br/>
<br/>
But, the way the surface of the plate is worked and the way the rim is formed look more like Tembo.  The area near the rim on the left side and at the bottom particularly have a Tembo-like punched look to it, even though I don't see any signs of a figurative pattern in the stamp.  Saotome has a modulated surface, but the working is not quite so deep and hard edged.  You may well have a transition piece.<br/>
<br/>
Generally if there's a mix of styles or an intermediate form the attribution tends to go to the later/lesser choice.  Sometimes it's a toss up as to which label to choose.  The more I look at your piece, the more the Tembo attribution makes sense, despite my initial reaction.<br/>
<br/>
You mentioned ten-zogan... is it really there?  That's a bit of a wild card for either type.<br/>
<br/>
If you can post or send me a copy of the origami I may be able to get some more clues from the attributed date and who the judge or judges were.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I didn't take the time to hit the books on this one.  Have you found published pieces with that kind of plate and rim attributed to Saotome?  I'd like to hear other opinions.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-383092160">Jim asked for other opinions so here's mine. I thought Tenbo as well <br/>
from the look of the plate, I think armourer work the plate metal <br/>
would be "richer". The heavy, punched look of this fits with Tenbo <br/>
work I have seen in spite of the lack of an identifiable "hot-stamp."<br/>

Thanks for your thoughts. I can see where the<br/>
hammerwork is a bit coarser on this than on<br/>
my Saotome pieces.  <br/>
