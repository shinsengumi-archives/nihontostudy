Not exactly my field, but I believe that they were done by kinko.  The Umetada did some kinzogan-mei for the Honami.  I seem to recall another specific group that worked for the Honami but I don't remember who it was.  I'm sure that a variety of kinko inlaid kinzogan-mei and cutting tests.  Maybe someone else on the list knows more.<br/>
<br/>
If I understood correctly, during one of his lectures at the Tampa show this year Tanobe-san mentioned that original Honami kinzogan-mei should be slightly lower than the surface of the nakago.  He explained that as the nakago rusts over the years the volume of the resulting iron oxide is greater than that of the iron it developed from.  So the gold inlay stays at the level of the original filed surface, but the surrounding iron "grows thicker" as it rusts.  I haven't checked it out for myself, though.  Anyone have a good Honami kinzogan-mei handy to check?<br/>

Tanobe-san was referring to Honami "attribution mei" rather than cutting tests.  I don't know whether cutting test inscriptions were initially filed flush with the surface of the nakago or not.  If the inlay was raised at all there won't be a reference point.  Also, an old but false cutting test or attribution would presumably have the same "depth" as a correct one of the same age.  I wouldn't take it as a certain test of the validity of an inlaid inscription.  <br/>
<br/>
I heard another tidbit about Umetada habaki once that I haven't been able to verify.  Their habaki are certainly of very high quality and the construction and finish are distinctive, but I was told that the Umetada were exceptionally good at fitting habaki to o-suriage swords.  I'm not sure what to make of that... anyone have any ideas?  I've certainly seen Umetada habaki on ubu tanto, so their type is not strictly developed for the nakago of shortened blades.<br/>

What is distinctive about Umetada habaki? I wouldn't know one<br/>
if I tripped over it. Any pics avaiable?<br/>

Are the Umetada habaki signed ? If not, what's the distinctive features that <br/>
point to the attribuion  of Umetada besides high quality ?<br/>

If anything it would be easier to fit a habaki to an o-suriage blade than an<br/>
ubu one as the latter might have a nakago that is greatly thicker than the<br/>
blade itself.<br/>
<br/>
I have a two piece habaki that is solid gold/silver covered with sheet gold,<br/>
it looks very old and is of crude manufacture compared with similar good<br/>
quality late Edo habaki which fit together almost like clockwork. I think it<br/>
was probably made by a country maker, any thoughts on this would be welcome.<br/>

I had the same thought.  I don't see why o-suriage would be more challenging to fit than a newly made sword.  But, I've never made a habaki.<br/>
<br/>
I had a sword with an old-looking, somewhat crude two piece plain copper habaki.  It was on a sword that was shortened a few cm.  It served its purpose, but it was far from precision work.  <br/>
