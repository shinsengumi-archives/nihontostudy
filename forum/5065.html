I have a tanto that looks to be signed Nio Kiyomune (not the easiest to read) , it is in shirasaya with sayagaki by Kawaguchi Noburo, the sayagaki says the sword is Nio Kiyomune and Bunmei era, sayagaki  is dated 1937 (i think, will have to check)........ anyway, Kiyomune is an obscure smith, but i thought there might be a slight chance this sword may have been in one of his books -- i was thinking that if he had the sword in his possession he may have taken an oshigata and as he was publishing reference books in that period maybe he included it...<br/>
<br/>
If anyone does have any info on this smith, or a reference oshigata i would appreciate any help<br/>
