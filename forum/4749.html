<h3>Miike school smith Sada Hide</h3>
by <i>dougblain</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1274256745">I have gone through all my books and online resources looking for more <br/>
information on a smith of the Chikugo Miike school, Sada Hide. The only <br/>
reference I have found is from the Sho-Shin website where the smith is <br/>
listed as Sada Hide Bun-Ei 1264. He is not listed in Hawley, Koto <br/>
Nihonto Zuikan, JSS cross-index or Yamanka's newsletters. I have a well <br/>
worn wakishasi of his with all the typical Miike characteristics (wide <br/>
hi, narrow suguha, etc.) and have been trying to find out any <br/>
additional information on this particular smith. The signature on the <br/>
blade is Miike ju Sada Hide (very faint). Hopefully there are some <br/>
better libraries out there...</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-492104763">It is shinogi zukuri,  22 long from the tip to the mune machi, kaki-toshi<br/>
and ubu as far as I can tell.  The total length is 27.2. Originally it was<br/>
very wide since the nakago is 5/16 at the widest. The blade has been<br/>
through many polishes and is now narrows to 3/16 (sorry but I will probably<br/>
never convert to metric). What is visible of the hamon is very narrow suguha<br/>
(1/8) and no turnback on the boshi. The size and length did bother me since<br/>
I also thought the wakisashi was introduced later, but it is what it is,<br/>
hence my curiosity about any additional information on the smith. <br/>

	The Meikan lists 8 koto smiths that signed Sada (tei) Hide (aki) two  <br/>
of which are listed as Miike smiths. The one from Bunei is said to be  <br/>
in the line of Miike Denta and it suggests more info on this smith  <br/>
may be found in the Kokon Kenko Meizukushi and the Kokon Kaji Mei  <br/>
Shuroku. The other is an Oei era smith working in Chikugo but only a  <br/>
niji-mei is given in the listing, more info on this smith is said to  <br/>
be found in the Kokon Ruiji Meizukushi and the Meizukushi Hiden Sho.  <br/>
Several of the Sadahide are working in Hirado, Fukunaga points out  <br/>
that these are considered to be smiths from the Sa school but at  <br/>
least one theory has it that they originated from Miike...<br/>
-t<br/>
PS the references mentioned are all old rare books none of which are  <br/>
in my meagre library.<br/>

<h3>Re: Miike school smith Sada Hide</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1627333128">Doug,  There is an excellent article written by Dr.Takeuchi <br/>
concerning history of the term Wakizashi.  Simply Google " <br/>
Historical Classification of Wakizashi."  I'm sure you will find it <br/>
informative.  I also recall reading other material which indicated <br/>
swords forged of the length between 1 and 2 shaku from the (approx.) <br/>
time period of 1200 to 1400 AD are "very few" in number.  After 1400 <br/>
AD there were many.  The "percentage probability" would most likely <br/>
place your sword in late Ko-to, perhaps early Shin-to, however, you <br/>
can't rule out the possibility of it being a 13/14th century blade. <br/>
The faint inscription, many polishes, could place it among the very <br/>
few....    Good luck,      Dave<br/>
