<h3>Sponsor Links at Nihonto Auctions</h3>
by <i>deron_vfr750</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-312678728">Hello,<br/>
<br/>
NihontoAuction.com is up and running. We've have a few good auctions<br/>
and some really neat Japanese sword related items. I would like to<br/>
make a one time announcement on the following.<br/>
<br/>
I've just created some sponsor links at NihontoAuctions.com. The<br/>
eventual idea is to provide the space for these links at a nominal fee<br/>
of around $2.00 per week. With a web interface that potential<br/>
advertisers can use to purchase advertising space. Since I don't have<br/>
that setup yet, I've had to manually create the links. You'll notice<br/>
that is looks a lot like Google AdWords :-) But unlike AdWords, it's<br/>
comparatively cheap.<br/>
<br/>
What you see now are links created for people that are providing<br/>
NihontoAuctions.com with a link on their website. I'm sorry if I<br/>
forgot anyone, please contact me privately and I'll add you.<br/>
<br/>
Once I get the ad purchasing webpage complete, I will create a LINKS<br/>
page and move these links to that page. For now, and until I get the<br/>
purchasing webpage complete, I'm offering free link/ad space for those<br/>
interested. It's a first come first served sort of thing since I have<br/>
limited space. Please contact me privately if you are interested.<br/>
<br/>
Again, I will create a links page in which I will place free of charge<br/>
anyones link that links NihontoAuctions.com. HOWEVER, for those<br/>
interested in front page advertising space, the cost will be around $2<br/>
a week once I get the purchasing webpage complete. (Approx 1 month).<br/>
<br/>
I hope this is fair. I'm not doing this to get rich, but to pay server<br/>
fees so I can continue to provide this service.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the band-width,<br/>
Deron<br/>
