<h3>Early sukashi tsuba attribution</h3>

Tsuba is 7.2 tall x 6.9 cm wide; 4 mm thick at the mimi.<br/>
I first thought Ko-Shoami because of the fine sukashi work.<br/>
But it looks Owari (and has bones in the rim). However it is on the <br/>
small side..which would place it late but it looks early and has <br/>
obviously been mounted many times.<br/>
What about Kyo-Shoami?<br/>

here goes (I have to try sometime haha)<br/>
 <br/>
My first guess would be Kyoto for the first tsuba, second guess Akasaka,<br/>
whatever it is dating to the (early) 1600's<br/>
 <br/>
Second tsuba: I am inclined to agree with Tom, early simple Onin. <br/>

How did I do ? <br/>

The broad seppa dai and the shape of the hitsuana are seen in Owari tsuba.  The style of the sukashi is more like Kyo work, though.  It's difficult to judge iron from photographs, but it doesn't look typically Owari.  I've seen guards that looked quite like Owari be judged as Shoami because of uncertainty over the lack of some classic characteristic or other.  Some of these sukashi pieces can be very difficult to pigeonhole with confidence because they share characteristics of Kyo and Owari.  My guess is that your guard would be attributed to Shoami.  Probably early Edo period or a bit older.<br/>
<br/>
The other guard is interesting.  Some of that type have plates like Kamakura bori and have a simple carving around the rim.  Others have plates more like Onin guards.  Both types can have a simple ring or two of brass inlay.  I don't think I've seen an example that has the rim hammered like yours, but aesthetically it seems like the same idea as the carved decoration seen on others.<br/>
<br/>
The style of the plate, the shape of the kozuka ana and the simple inlay decoration would all point to an Onin attribution.    How thick is it?  Probably mid Muromachi at least.<br/>

Probably not Kyo-Shoami given the lack of marubori elements and/or nunome zogan.  Shoami if Edo period or Ko-Shoami if pre-Edo -- at least that is my interpretation of your guard based on my knowledge of the current kantei conventions.  <br/>
<br/>
3.5 mm is rather thick for early Onin work, although the surface of the plate does look old.  John's guard looks younger than yours in both the plate and the inlay style.<br/>

Very good calls -- well done.  However, I have to say that Akasaka would be difficult to defend.  That mokko shape would be very unusual for Akasaka.  Their seppa dai tended to be more narrow and were often somewhat to very pointed at the top in the early generations.  The broad shape would be, again unusual.  They didn't normally do quadrilateral symmetry like that and the hitsuana are also not typical, although Tadashige often made "dovetails" for (often non-existent) sekigane like we see here on the kozuka ana side.  Akasaka construction often used a hard, smooth kawagane that looks quite different from the texture of the iron on this guard.  The rim is usually very round in the early generations.<br/>
<br/>
BUT... there are a bunch of signed Akasaka guards by later generations that are not obviously in Akasaka style based on the carving, motifs and even inlay.  It's an interesting study.   The first Akasaka died around 1657, FWIW.  Pretty sure it's not an Akasaka piece, though.<br/>
<br/>
Writing opinions is a great way to learn.  Keep it up and don't worry about the feet.  You did good.<br/>

  This is my totally uninformed novice opinion. So feel free to put your<br/>
  foot in if I am way off base here.  Anyway with that disclaimer gone<br/>
  here goes (I have to try sometime haha)<br/>
<br/>
  My first guess would be Kyoto for the first tsuba, second guess Akasaka,<br/>
  whatever it is dating to the (early) 1600's<br/>
<br/>
  Second tsuba: I am inclined to agree with Tom, early simple Onin. <br/>
<br/>
  How did I do ? <br/>

  Thanks very much for the help!<br/>
  Kyo-Shoami it is on the sukashi guard.<br/>
<br/>
  On the other, Onin makes absolute sense..and the pics of John's <br/>
  tsuba look right on (plate and ring)<br/>
  Btw, the rim is 3.5 mm and is uniform on the Onin tsuba..<br/>
<br/>
  Thanks again,<br/>

  Owari tsuba.  The style of the sukashi is more like Kyo work, <br/>
  though.  It's difficult to judge iron from photographs, but it <br/>
  doesn't look typically Owari.  I've seen guards that looked quite <br/>
  like Owari be judged as Shoami because of uncertainty over the lack <br/>
  of some classic characteristic or other.  Some of these sukashi <br/>
  pieces can be very difficult to pigeonhole with confidence because <br/>
  they share characteristics of Kyo and Owari.  My guess is that your <br/>
  guard would be attributed to Shoami.  Probably early Edo period or a <br/>
  bit older.<br/>

  like Kamakura bori and have a simple carving around the rim.  Others <br/>
  have plates more like Onin guards.  Both types can have a simple <br/>
  ring or two of brass inlay.  I don't think I've seen an example that <br/>
  has the rim hammered like yours, but aesthetically it seems like the <br/>
  same idea as the carved decoration seen on others.<br/>

  How thick is it?  Probably mid Muromachi at least.<br/>

Matt,<br/>
Very good calls -- well done.  However, I have to say that Akasaka would<br/>
be difficult to defend.  That mokko shape would be very unusual for<br/>
Akasaka.  Their seppa dai tended to be more narrow and were often<br/>
somewhat to very pointed at the top in the early generations.  The broad<br/>
shape would be, again unusual.  They didn't normally do quadrilateral<br/>
symmetry like that and the hitsuana are also not typical, although<br/>
Tadashige often made "dovetails" for (often non-existent) sekigane like<br/>
we see here on the kozuka ana side.  Akasaka construction often used a<br/>
hard, smooth kawagane that looks quite different from the texture of the<br/>
iron on this guard.  The rim is usually very round in the early<br/>
generations.<br/>
<br/>
BUT... there are a bunch of signed Akasaka guards by later generations<br/>
that are not obviously in Akasaka style based on the carving, motifs and<br/>
even inlay.  It's an interesting study.   The first Akasaka died around<br/>
1657, FWIW.  Pretty sure it's not an Akasaka piece, though.<br/>
<br/>
Writing opinions is a great way to learn.  Keep it up and don't worry<br/>
about the feet.  You did good.<br/>
<br/>
