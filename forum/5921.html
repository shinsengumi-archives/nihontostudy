<div id="ygrps-yiv-105829497">I have recently acquired a WWII Trophy, a WWII Veteran bring back Tanto.<br/>
<br/>
This  Japanese Tanto may be of the Osoraku Zukuri blade form. It was found<br/>
on the body of Commander Goichi Oya (Commander of Japanese forces on Tinian<br/>
Island during WW II), who committed Seppuku in a cave on the Island during<br/>
the US invasion. The body and the Tanto were found by a US Marine named<br/>
Fred Osgood who was awarded the Bronze Star and a Purple Heart. He sent the<br/>
Tanto home in 1944 after the action on Tinian Island, and it was in his<br/>
possession since his return from the war until November of 2012 when it<br/>
came into my possession.<br/>
<br/>
The Tanto is 13 1/16" long with 3 3/8" being the Nakago (As measured from<br/>
the Tsuba notch). It is 0.229" thick just in front of the notch. The Nakago<br/>
tapers to 0.115 at it's end (See attached file image).<br/>
<br/>
At this point I am wondering if any one has more information on this<br/>
particular, or type of,  Tanto.<br/>
<br/>
What I have found so far is that Commander Giochi Oya was A Commander in<br/>
the Imperial Japanese Navy, and Commander of the IJN 56th guard Unit, with<br/>
his head Quarters at Mt. Lasso, Tinian Island. He was responsible for the<br/>
defenses of the four air fields on Tinian Island. There on Tinian Island he<br/>
committed Seppuku  August 2, 1944.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1932207521">What an interesting story! Unless you can post photos of the tanto and its nakago, I for one would love to see some photos of it. One would think the commander would have owned a quality tanto, be it old or Showa era. Others may also ask to see these too, I'd suspect. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks, Ron STL (Hartmann)<br/>

The allotted storage used to be quite miserly requiring frequent deletions, but now 100G.  Go wild.<br/>

Here are some oldies found there with Jim Kurrasch and Joe Bott:<br/>
