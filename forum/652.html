<div id="ygrps-yiv-355354706">What a guy, Ken Mack! It was in 1992 when my wife began her one year struggle with cancer. At her last sword show--probably in Houston I guess--Ken, who was also struggling and somehow surviving his cancer, had a wonderful "pep-talk" with Kathy that truly helped her to continue her treatments. It amazes me to realize Ken survived another eleven years. He shall be missed!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-139907699">Yes it is true. A member of McClafferty Sensei's dojo called and told me. I<br/>
remember him from the Houston sword shows 20 years ago. What a riot he was.<br/>
When that guy walked in teh room he sort of took over. Bad jokes and teh<br/>
whole bit. Fearless. A lot of fun to be around. I spoke to him a few months<br/>
ago and he was weak then. But he survived so long with his desease I<br/>
understand it has not been done before. God bless him and his family. BO<br/>
