I've wondered if those swords made for export to China were mounted in Japan.  If they were shipped with koshirae, would they have bothered with kozuka and kogai?  If they were mounted in China, would there be any reason for them to be fitted out like a Japanese sword?  The signed guard in the Boston museum collection has kozuka and kogai ana, so it was presumably made for a Japanese-style mount, or perhaps just copied from a Japanese tsuba treating the ana as part of the decoration rather than for use. <br/>

  Jim. that would be interesting, as at the start of the Kangxi period,<br/>
  the whole of China was effectively still at war since the Qing were<br/>
  taking over from the earlier Ming dynasty rulers. <br/>
<br/>
  When dating Chinese porcelain, we make use of a term called the<br/>
  "Transitional Period" that lasts from 1620 - 1683 approx to indicate<br/>
  that these pieces were made during a time of great turmoil, when the<br/>
  imperial porcealain factories were not functioning (they had been<br/>
  ransacked)............ however I digress.<br/>
<br/>
  We also know that hundreds of thousands of Japanese swords were exported<br/>
  to the Chinese Court from the Kamakura period onwards into the 15th<br/>
  century. However I have no literature stating that this continued into<br/>
  the 17th cent, does anyone know anything about that ?<br/>
<br/>
  One can just imagine some metal worker in Nanking making a tsuba for his<br/>
  Great Grandfathers treasured Japanese sword to take it to war once<br/>
  again........ <br/>
<br/>
  I  might add it is extremely unusual for any Chinese artisan to sign<br/>
  their work with the exception of perhaps paintings. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1825760968">Good point Jim, that would be fascinating to find out. I do know that<br/>
the swords were nearly all exported to the Chinese Court and the<br/>
aristocracy, and they (the Chinese upper class, especially the Emperor)<br/>
had a kind of tendency to "embelish" items of great value. The 18th cent<br/>
Qianlong emperor for example had his own poems engraved onto priceless<br/>
12th cent Song Dynasty works or art that were handed down through the<br/>
generations. I could quite well imagine them replacing a Japanese tsuba<br/>
on a Japanese sword with one of their own if they thought it was an<br/>
improvement. <br/>
 <br/>
My guess would be that the swords were exported with koshirae, but I<br/>
would love to know for sure how this exactly went down. Another<br/>
interesting point is that in 12 years I have never ever seen a Japanese<br/>
sword found at the Imperial Chinese court. Since so many of them were<br/>
exported all those years ago, you would think there must still be one or<br/>
two lying around. Very strange ! <br/>

Could it be at some point after the war, all things Japanese were <br/>
purged from Chinese holdings? or even more likely were culled by the <br/>
Japanese when they were there...<br/>
