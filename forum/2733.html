<h3>Need tsuba gurus</h3>
by <i>tsuba4sale</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1575331645">Hello Group...<br/>
<br/>
I have several tsuba I am trying to understand.  I am a newcomer to<br/>
the tsuba and have very little research material.  In other words, I<br/>
know very little.  What I really need to know is are they good or bad<br/>
- what is their value if any.<br/>
<br/>
The tsuba can be viewed at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.geocities.com/tsuba4sale/">http://www.geocities.com/tsuba4sale/</a><br/>
<br/>
If this is an inappropriate question for this group I apologize.  I<br/>
really have no resources nearby who can help me.  Several antique<br/>
dealers have made offers but I just don't know enough [I know they are<br/>
tsuba but thats it].  I have no use for them as I already have enough<br/>
stuff.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thank you in advance....<br/>

<h3>Crass Commercial Message</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-15140860">All, through one of my contacts in Japan, I am able to offer some <br/>
excellent Kodogu and Inrou boxes for sale. These deluxe boxes were hand <br/>
crafted by a master Japanese Togi, since passed away and are being <br/>
offered for sale by his wife.<br/>
<br/>
The boxes are made from Ichii-Wood and are lined in quality silk and <br/>
have silk pillows. The Deluxe Lacquer boxes are made from Akita-Sugi ( <br/>
Japanese Pine, grew in Akita Prefecture ) and lacquered with Japanese <br/>
Shun-Kei-Nuri.<br/>
<br/>
Please have a look and contact me if you would like any more information <br/>
or to order one. Their numbers are limited.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers and thanks for the band width.<br/>

<h3>Laminations and tekkotsu</h3>
by <i>retalt</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1965375513">All, I was wondering how common visible Laminations and tekkotsu were in <br/>
older Choshu tsuba. I have a new piece, that I believe shows clear <br/>
Tekkotsu and also lamination in the mimi.<br/>
<br/>
The images that follow ( sorry for the poor quality, I will try to get <br/>
better ones this weekend ) are attempting to show what I am referring <br/>
to. This first image looks like a lamination showing, and a small dent <br/>
around the area in question.<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.nihontomessageboard.com/tsuba_collection/Choshu_Kawaji/mimi-1.jpg">http://www.nihontomessageboard.com/tsuba_collection/Choshu_Kawaji/mimi-1.jpg</a><br/>
<br/>
This image is another lamination showing in another section of the mimi.<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.nihontomessageboard.com/tsuba_collection/Choshu_Kawaji/mimi-3.jpg">http://www.nihontomessageboard.com/tsuba_collection/Choshu_Kawaji/mimi-3.jpg</a><br/>
<br/>
This section, I am trying to show what looks like running bones, but <br/>
again, my photography skills fail me. Basically, through the highlite <br/>
area, there is a bone running on the diagonal.<br/>

<br/>
So, is this common for Choshu works, or is it is un common ?????. I <br/>
believe the better works were from the earlier periods, though I am sure <br/>
there are some excellent examples from the last smiths as well.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers<br/>
<br/>

<h3>Re: [nihontostudy] Laminations and tekkotsu</h3>
by <i>Barry Thomas</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1648458926">Hmmm.  Just ruminating. The laminations are I think the blade equivalent of<br/>
kizu - ware - and ideally shouldn't be there.  "Bones" I have no idea about<br/>
although I think they are small lumps of higher carbon content = harder steel,<br/>
so they should stand proud of the surface, like currants in a bun.  Your third<br/>
pic is difficult because it looks to me like an "ordinary" rusted surface where<br/>
the high bits are only high because of the corrosion pits leave them standing.<br/>
Do they look like different steel???  Thus draineth my pitiful knowledge...<br/>
