I should have put NSR (Not Sword Related) because the 7000 swords all appear <br/>
to be repros, but it is nonetheless grist for our mill as a dilution of <br/>
knowledge as to what constitutes genuine historical swords endangers <br/>
Japanese art swords.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1749103866">Somehow I find this very disturbing and somewhat confusing..<br/>
 <br/>
I just sent, Via USPS, a rather expensive pattern welded sword to a client  <br/>
in Ireland and he had no problem at all..and he has had no problems with <br/>
earlier  shipments as well in either clearing Irish Customs or anything else.  <br/>
Why  he would have no problems and why the Irish police would raid and <br/>
confiscate  these I have no idea as I have not read any Irish law as far as <br/>
swords go as  yet.<br/>
 <br/>
Maybe this is due to the fact that the swords I have been sending are  <br/>
historical replicas and those confiscated were not?<br/>
