<h3>care of freshly polished sword</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1370477691">I just had a beat-up old sword polished.  First polish job I've had done.<br/>
The sword arrived back wrapped in plastic wrap and seems to have some<br/>
preservative oil (choji oil?) on it.  I was about to get out the uchiko<br/>
powder and start cleaning, when it occurred to me, perhaps I should ask:<br/>
what's the correct drill for caring for newly polished blades?<br/>

You want to do the regular cleaning you already do, and hopefully <br/>
you're using real Japanese choji oil, not one of the cheap knockoffs. <br/>
The only difference with a newly polished blade is that you want to <br/>
be cleaning it a lot more frequently than normal, at least once a <br/>
week. Polishing takes a layer off (more if not done by an expert), <br/>
and leaves the blade that much more vulnerable to humidity the first <br/>
couple of months. I don't know where you're located, but the <br/>
frequency of your cleanings would depend on the environment, too. The <br/>
more humidity the blade is exposed to, the more frequently your sword <br/>
cleaning kit should be put to use.<br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps.<br/>
