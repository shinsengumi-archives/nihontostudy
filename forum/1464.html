HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA - I only waited a year because of computer troubles.  About<br/>
this time last year I had PC problems and had to use my son's hand-me-down<br/>
computer.  I fixed my regular one (long story - 12 months worth!!) and merged<br/>
all the mail files from the other computer, and simply thought that it was a<br/>
current posting!!!  I didn't even look at the date, just the info...<br/>

This post is mainly directed to Mr Gilbert but I thought that maybe if <br/>
someone else would like to comment that would be great.<br/>
I was browsing your lovely tsuba site and have a question regarding the <br/>
last tsuba on page two of the Early Iron tsuba link.<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://home.earthlink.net/%7Ejggilbert/oldiron2.htm">http://home.earthlink.net/%7Ejggilbert/oldiron2.htm</a><br/>
You are writing that it's an unusual guard, does this mean its hard to <br/>
kantei? How confident are you about it being a late Muromachi tsuba? <br/>
Have you or someone else seen this type of tsuba before, maybe in books <br/>
as for reference?<br/>
The thing is that I have a very similar tsuba, almost identical, and i <br/>
would like to have as much information about it as possible. Do you <br/>
think it may be from the same era as yours or would mine be a later copy?<br/>
The measurements on my tsuba are almost the same as yours, mine is <br/>
slightly thicker.<br/>
8.0 cm H x 8.0 cm W x 0.4 cm T<br/>

<br/>
I love opening my mouth so others can put their feet in...<br/>
<br/>
I await correction, but I think Fredrik's tsuba is a very late copy as it (a)<br/>
simply lacks the aesthetic excellence of the original (b) its condition is<br/>
extremely poor (c) it is so "picture perfect" that I think it has been copied<br/>
from the original out of a book!!!  Possibly even late 20th century...<br/>

I'll stick my neck out first.<br/>
   I'd say same design, later copy. Possibly much<br/>
later. There are several differences. For starters,<br/>
the shape of the seppa dai. The quality of the iron is<br/>
also an important one and probably why Jim's is dated<br/>
as he has it. The sukashi on his is very gentle, yet<br/>
the iron like extra hard armor iron so the tsuba could<br/>
be considered either kyo-sukashi or katchushi.<br/>
<br/>
In a case like yours, someone just needs to make a<br/>
judgement call on the iron and the workmanship of the<br/>
sukashi. <br/>

I think he meant late 19th century (post 1870), but I<br/>
could be wrong.<br/>
<br/>
Designs re-occur with little change over a much longer<br/>
period of time than I would have thought when I first<br/>
started in this hobby. In this case, we are comparing<br/>
a 16th century tsuba to a 19th century one. The<br/>
workmanship and material is different, but the design<br/>
is the same.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1325001085">Maybe my imagination, but to my eye many of these<br/>
"late" copies (how late remains to be seen I guess)<br/>
have a look of a stamped out piece of metal; literally<br/>
the design and "flatness" of the metal looks like<br/>
it was done with a stamping machine. I'm purely<br/>

I agree with the earlier posts.<br/>
<br/>
The one I have is strange because the seppa dai, kozuka ana and sukashi carving are very much like Kyo sukashi, but the thickness and folding are like a Ko-Tosho guard.  Ita plate tsuba with extensive sukashi work are usually attributed to Katchushi, and that's why I placed the guard on that page.  The iron is more like Owari than any of the above, though.  It's a strange combination, but each "component" is consistent with ca. late Muromachi.<br/>
<br/>
Your guard has a wider seppa dai, wider kozuka ana, thicker sukashi walls and a thicker plate.  It has a lot of rust and pitting that make it hard to see the surface but the unrusted areas look very flat and sharp.  Nothing about it points to an early origin, despite using the same design.  Without seeing it in person it's hard to say if it is a modern repro that has been intentionally rusted or an Edo period guard in poor condition.  I wouldn't be surprised if it's modern.

  You are writing that it's an unusual guard, does this mean its hard to <br/>
  kantei? How confident are you about it being a late Muromachi tsuba? <br/>
  Have you or someone else seen this type of tsuba before, maybe in books <br/>

  The thing is that I have a very similar tsuba, almost identical, and i <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2108437360">Milt mentioning Sasano made me think of an example from the NTHK shinsa in London.  Not talking about copies or junk, there was an early guard with the classic kiri mon and karakusa motif often seen in Kyo-sukashi tsuba.  Just like number 37 in Sasano's Early Japanese Sword Guards.  If I was looking at a photo I would have no problem calling it Kyo sukashi.  The "problem" is that the rim was a mass of Owari-style tekkotsu.  It's easier to change sukashi design than to change ore/processing/forging so the kantei went to Owari rather than Kyo.  Kantei from photos is risky.<br/>
