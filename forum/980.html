<br/>
you all recall these menuki I took off from the tsuka of a sword i <br/>
bought on e-bay.<br/>
<br/>
I found a very similar example from the Haynes catalog # 9, page152-<br/>
3, lot # 353.<br/>
I quote............ " highly important main line Goto menuki.  The <br/>
plate is the very best deep black shakudo. The mochi cake is heavy <br/>
sheet silver uttori over the shakudo.  The wiskers and eyes of the <br/>
rats are gold uttori.  The hair of the rats is very well defined, <br/>
though worn down.  The mochi cake has many of the secret main line <br/>
Goto marks.  This pair would be about the time of Tokujo or Yeijo, <br/>
the fifth and sixth mainline Goto masters (ca.1575-1600 ).  I have <br/>
seen another pair of menuki almost identical with this pair ( and <br/>
including the matching kogai ) with the original Goto papers stating <br/>
them to be the work of Tokujo.  This pair is every bit as fine. Juyo <br/>
material. Ca.1600  "<br/>
<br/>
Nothing is for sure till they are submitted for shinsa, at least it <br/>
looks " encouraging ".<br/>
