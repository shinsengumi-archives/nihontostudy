<div id="ygrps-yiv-451716857">Personally, I think this is an area where American collectors are too ready<br/>
to follow the Japanese point of view.<br/>
<br/>
If a collector of antique American furniture found a 150 year signature<br/>
falsely attributing a piece of furniture to the wrong maker, he would<br/>
certainly take the misattribution into account in valuing the piece, but in<br/>
no circumstances would he remove that old signature.  In his eyes, the false<br/>
old signature had been part of the piece long enough to become part of its<br/>
history, not perhaps the best part, but a part of some interest providing a<br/>
piece of historical information which one would not simply discard or<br/>
destroy.<br/>
<br/>
In Nihonto, we even have the case of gimei Muramasa blades, where signatures<br/>
were altered or changed when the legend of blades by that maker and his<br/>
school and their ill-luck for members of the Tokugawa family caused<br/>
possession of Muramasa swords to be banned.  It seems a real crime against<br/>
history simply to eradicate a feature so historically evocative as this<br/>
particular sort of gimei, and I would dispense with papers myself rather<br/>
than remove such a false signature.<br/>

<h3>Re: Gimei removal and Nakago Repatination</h3>
by <i>davidzincavage</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1775210745">Your rejoinder I think provides a good illustration of the manner in which<br/>
the Japanese perspective differs from the Occidental on matters of this<br/>
kind.  In pretty much any area of antique collecting in the West where an<br/>
appraiser was writing up a piece featuring a several hundred year old false<br/>
signature, the Western appraiser would simply describe the piece and note<br/>
his rejection of the signature as invalid and proceed to make his own<br/>
attribution. His description would include note of the false signature, and<br/>
his assumption would be that a clear written description, especially one<br/>
accompanied by a picture, would be entirely adequate to remove the<br/>
possibility of anyone being misled.  The false signature's perfidy, once<br/>
recognized in the light of contemporary scholarship would be considered<br/>
historic, and consequently, merely interesting and amusing, rather than a<br/>
continuing active offense.<br/>
<br/>
If a modern American organization were evaluating Japanese swords, and the<br/>
case of an ancient gimei came along, what we would expect is papers to be<br/>
issued simply noting that the signature is false and making a different<br/>
attribution.<br/>
<br/>
One significant difference between antique furniture and Japanese swords<br/>
does come to mind:  it is a good deal easier distinquish American furniture<br/>
makers and schools than to appraise Nihonto.  Yet, inevitably, mistakes<br/>
occur, and sometimes opinions and evaluations change.  The Japanese approach<br/>
of gimei removal and nakago repatination is based on the assumption that<br/>
this shinsa committee's judgement this day is 100% correct and could never<br/>
ever be reversed.  Now some gimei are doubtless unquestionably what they<br/>
are.  I own a Mino-den tanto signed Masamune, which has no possibility<br/>
whatsoever of being a Masamune.  But I'm sure not all cases are as clear.<br/>
In most areas of conservation and collecting, irreversible changes to a<br/>
piece would always be avoided.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This is one of the things that I too found lacking in the shinsa<br/>
process.<br/>
<br/>
One open area for research is "how many smiths signed Kanesada" and even<br/>
that there may have been more than one signing "Nosada."<br/>
<br/>
In this environment, how reliable is a decision of gimei to be in the<br/>
situation where a signature looks good but the workmanship doesn't match<br/>
"*the* Nidai Kanesada?" Certainly not 100% in all cases.<br/>
<br/>
One can see the unreliability of the shinsa process in the stories of<br/>
multiple submittals to Hozon for a sword in attempts to get the "right"<br/>
paper for it and getting multiple results. That is not a criticism, just<br/>
an indication that it is a process linked to subjectivity and<br/>
differences of opinion.<br/>
<br/>
As such, are we to make the irreversible and destructive action of<br/>
removing a signature in order to obtain whatever opinion has been<br/>
withheld because current scholarship would indicate the signature is<br/>
bad? <br/>
<br/>
Certainly that too will be on a case by case basis, and while some are a<br/>
clear cut "hee hee this 'masamune' mei is bad, remove it" others may not<br/>
be so clear.<br/>
<br/>
It would be nice if an avenue existed where one could obtain the best<br/>
official opinion without possibly destroying something that might be,<br/>
after all, correct and deemed so by future generations of scholars.<br/>
<br/>
I have a sword that falls into these categories. I would never remove<br/>
the mei from it, and I am 90% sure that it will fail shinsa, and I am<br/>
60% sure that it is gimei.<br/>
<br/>
I don't want to go and smash up something that existed for three hundred<br/>
years though, should it be correct in the end. I am not even sure how<br/>
good I feel about removing it if it is only grafitti as it is part of<br/>
the history of the sword.<br/>
