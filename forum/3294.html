Priced at 3 million yen, I think it would want to be Juyo LOL. What are <br/>
the groups thought's on this<br/>
<br/>
Another thought, I have seen several good pieces put up for Tokubetsu <br/>
Hozon bounced recently and I think that Kodogu shinsa is a tough game <br/>
for many of us, so know your hobby I think.............. agghhh, but the <br/>
thrill of the chase eh !!!!!<br/>

 Well for 3,000,000 JPY there are a lot of fine things out there, but I don't think that is one of them. Of course it all boils down to supply and demand and Yamakichibei are admired, but that one looks very pedestrian to me. Just my two cents worth. <br/>

Comparing it to the Yamakichi tsuba that are already Juyo I doubt that it <br/>
will make it, even though it is a very well known, published piece.<br/>
