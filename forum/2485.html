<h3>masanori tsuba and fuchi</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1852706290">Hi everyone,<br/>
<br/>
I'm a kodogu dummy. Anyone know what I'm dealing with here?<br/>
<br/>
Signature looks like Masanori to me. Can someone identify who he is<br/>
exactly? <br/>

The material is silver. There is a kao on the tsuba and a signature on<br/>
the fuchi, and the styles do match. There is a kojiri on this saya as<br/>
well, along with a fuchi and koiguchi that are all done in the same<br/>
style. It's very nice, all pieces are silver.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone have recommendations about the care and feeding of silver<br/>
fittings (Jim?). I'm guessing leave it alone and don't touch it.<br/>
<br/>
The patina on silver is caused unfortunately by sulphur in the air,<br/>
which is a product of the industrial revolution. Black Tarnish (silver<br/>
sulfide) is not a native and normal patina for old silver in the days<br/>
when it was made... it's pretty uneven on the tsuba as can be seen, and<br/>
the kashira is also kind of rough.<br/>
<br/>
I do want to know though if there is a proper care procedure if someone<br/>
does know. As well, I'd like to submit this koshirae for papers and<br/>
want to make sure I'm doing everything right.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Dear Darcy<br/>
<br/>
Yes - the signature on the fuchi is, indeed, Masanori.  'Kinko <br/>
Meikan' shows only one artist using these kanji (p.453, lower <br/>
right), but this is not the same artist.  Haynes, in his 'Index of <br/>
Japanese Sword Fittings ...', lists no fewer than seven such <br/>
artists  but does not show the kakihan (H 04383.0 - H 04389.0).<br/>
<br/>
The seal on the tsuba I, personally, do not recognise.<br/>
<br/>
So the fuchi is by a Masanori, but which one?  If it is indeed part <br/>
of a set, the tsuba with its seal might possibly help in the <br/>
identification of the artist.<br/>
<br/>

I've seen. I don't normally go in for Yamato, but I felt that it was<br/>
just an exemplary sword, filled with dignity, and the koshirae also I<br/>
felt was very nice.<br/>
<br/>
So it is my sole Yamato study piece for the medium future. I'm curious<br/>
in that they had it marked as a Nambokucho blade, but I feel that it<br/>
could possibly be Kamakura. What were your thoughts?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1091154520">Hi Darcy,<br/>
I'm glad you got it, it's a great sword, regarding the date it could be late<br/>
KK rather than NB period as I felt that if there was any doubt about period<br/>
on a blade I would go for a later date, I would not like a collector to buy<br/>
a sword catalogued as late KK only to get a paper as NB. Swords aren't an<br/>
exact science by any means as I found out recently, a few years ago I bought<br/>
an o-suriage mumei blade I was sure was by Motoshige, when it went for<br/>
shinsa it made Tokubetsu Hozon as Bitchu Aoe! I thought then I should give<br/>
up swords and collect stamps, however three months ago it made Juyo as<br/>
Motoshige! Did you come to London for the sale?<br/>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-900247017">Darcy,<br/>
It looks like there was a storage problem with the tsuba or maybe a partial cleaning attempt in the past.  It doesn't look like it will become uniform on its own over time (short of waiting for it to turn entirely black).  I have no personal experience with repatinating silver, but I think that this may need professional work to restore an even patina.  <br/>
<br/>
I don't think that the present condition of the patina would be a killer at shinsa, but it would result in a "point" reduction.  Polishing the fittings would definitely be worse than leaving them as-is.  <br/>
<br/>
Doubt I told you anything you didn't already know...<br/>
Jim<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  Anyone have recommendations about the care and feeding of silver<br/>
  fittings (Jim?). I'm guessing leave it alone and don't touch it.<br/>
<br/>
  The patina on silver is caused unfortunately by sulphur in the air,<br/>
  which is a product of the industrial revolution. Black Tarnish (silver<br/>
  sulfide) is not a native and normal patina for old silver in the days<br/>
  when it was made... it's pretty uneven on the tsuba as can be seen, and<br/>
  the kashira is also kind of rough.<br/>
<br/>
  I do want to know though if there is a proper care procedure if someone<br/>
  does know. As well, I'd like to submit this koshirae for papers and<br/>
  want to make sure I'm doing everything right.<br/>
