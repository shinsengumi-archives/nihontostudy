<div id="ygrps-yiv-1695677546">Hi:<br/>
 I should know a little about Fred's book as I wrote a brief foreword<br/>
for it. I contains some useful information derived from various sources,<br/>
however the whole area of books on gendai is rapidly changing and there<br/>
is no definitive book out there to the best of my knowledge. Fred's book<br/>
is a contribution to the literature and there are a number of similar<br/>
books in the same space. <br/>
 The problem is that the very term "gendai", meaning current era, has<br/>
never been well defined in year brackets and it is slipping into disuse.<br/>
For some it is for <br/>
all blades made after the Haitorei regulations which culminated in the<br/>
banning of civilian wearing of swords in public in 1876, for others the<br/>
term starts with the blades of the Showa era, that being 1926-1989, and<br/>
even after, and for others it ends in 1945 or shortly after, say with<br/>
the end of the Occupation in 1953. The term used now for blades made<br/>
contemporarily is "shinsakuto" or "new made swords" and that gets pushed<br/>
back to the end of gendaito, whenever that might be, so take your pick.<br/>
Much of what is out there now represents culled work from other sources<br/>
and there is little original research. Mr. Chris Bowen, who was resident<br/>
in Japan for some years, since having returned to the USA, has gathered<br/>
a lot of information on gendai smiths of the Tokyo area and has stated<br/>
that a book will eventually be produced. That is something I am eagerly<br/>
looking forward to as it will contain original information in English on<br/>
a number of smiths, particularly those working during the last war,<br/>
about whom little is known outside or inside Japan. I have no idea when<br/>
it will see the light of day.<br/>
 One recent book that you should get is Yasukuni To by Tom Kishida and<br/>
published this year by Kodansha. It is focused primarily on the blades<br/>
made at the Yasukuni Jinja in Tokyo, but in putting them in context it<br/>
says a fair amount about the low state of blade making prior to 1933,<br/>
tells us something about the destruction of the basis for the craft<br/>
right after 1876 and also discusses the traditions from which the<br/>
Yasukuni smiths came from and something of their work after the war. It<br/>
is a must have book!<br/>
 I hope this helps.<br/>

 Arnold Frenzel<br/>
