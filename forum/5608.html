<div id="ygrps-yiv-1196904807">Hi All - <br/>
<br/>
Recently, I've placed four nice kogai and three kozuka on Danny Massey's site, nihontocraft.com, in hopes of raising a few bucks and also to throw a little business Danny's way. Hard sell in today's economy but hey, have a look and maybe you'll find something you just gotta have! (That happens to me all the time!)<br/>
