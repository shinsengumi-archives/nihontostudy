The judges don't see who the items belong to, but some years ago when doing the paperwork jobs and moving items from place to place around the room it was very clear that pass rate could vary drastically with customer.  It wasn't unusual to see a one guy submit a big group of items with 90% passing and the next do the same with 90% failing.  It's quite a report card for those willing to read it.  Of course I suppose shinsa is still very cheap compared to long-term serious study.<br/>

  I had a good laugh over that.  Some years ago four of us from my part of the world travelled 600 miles to see some collector mates in another State.  It was a great get together and we stayed for 5 days enjoying the hospitality and the viewings.  One of our mates there has had a collection of fittings for many years.  At one stage of the proceedings he cried out "Why isn't anyone looking at the fittings??!!"  The following words sprang unbidden to my mind "Because they're all crap mate".  He did have a couple of nice pieces, but the rest...  When I hear about the "rain of pink slips" at Shinsa I know people aren't even beginning to try and do their own study and homework, like my mate who prefers to "keep and dream" rather than find out or even advance his knowledge.  I've always used Shinsa to back my own judgement.  In the early daze I had blades fail, but I never had a tosogu fail.  The learning curve is steep and long.<br/>

Couldn't agree more Jim, and of course, it is a lot easier ( read less <br/>
effort ) as well. Thanks to mentors such as Barry Thomas, I spent over <br/>
10K in my first 3 or 4 years on my library, and I am still tweaking and <br/>
refining it, the more I learn, the more I realise, this books out, I <br/>
need that book instead. It is ongoing and I see no end to it, that's <br/>
fine. I have been told on more than a dozen occasions, you could have <br/>
bought 100 tsuba for that money, yes I could, but I would have 100 crap <br/>
tsuba and I would have learnt only that " this is what a crap tsuba <br/>
looks like'. I remember sometime back someone asked on another forum, <br/>
"why the US shows don't have a lecture on Flaws, what they look like etc <br/>
for newbies" and Gordon Robson answered, " why do you want to learn <br/>
about flaws". I thought it the perfect answer, the author didn't. I seem <br/>
to recall that started an interesting spat of disagreements LOL.<br/>
<br/>
I had a private message the other day bagging the latest NTHK shinsa <br/>
very heavily, and I came away questioning just how much the author of <br/>
that letter really knew. Some of the questions answered themselves, so I <br/>
did not know what it was he was asking. I assume that is what Jim is <br/>
also asking. What is it they want to know ?.<br/>
<br/>
I think there is a real leaning towards collecting for profit and resale <br/>
and less towards collecting for study.<br/>
<br/>
Sad, I wish I was around in the good old days.<br/>

not too many collectors starting out in the field can tell the <br/>
difference  betwen utsuri and shirake utsuri or shirazomi. And how <br/>
about jifu utsuri from core steel showing etc etc. ? That is, unless <br/>
you are a " natural "............<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Haven't seen "shirazomi" before, can you define it?  Also, isn't true<br/>
jifu utsuri actually different from shin tetsu showing through?  In<br/>
any event, this was one of the more subtle flaws to learn to see.  I<br/>
have a couple of expensive lessons still in my possession.<br/>
