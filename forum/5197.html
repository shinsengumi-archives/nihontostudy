I think it's knitted copper wire on iron.<br/>

	Not sure how to address you, this is called a Shingen or Mukade  <br/>
tsuba. Not so odd to those who have been around the study for awhile.  <br/>
These are so called as it is said, but has not been proven, that  <br/>
Takeda Shingen's hand-picked personal guard and messenger unit the  <br/>
Mukade-Tai wore these on their swords. Shingen himself is said to  <br/>
have awarded these as badges of merit to his troops. For this reason  <br/>
they are quite popular and there have been many copies of this design.<br/>
	Your example looks to be all copper given that the surface of the  <br/>
seppa-dai appears to have been hammered and there are tiny stars  <br/>
punched into the surface. Originals if such a thing exists are indeed  <br/>
copper or brass wire woven thru an iron plate. Mukade BTW means  <br/>
Centipede...<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It certainly means someone thought it was, but that doesn't mean much.<br/>
 I have seen known repos go for alot.  Most of us have (most of us<br/>
have also been the one to bid high as well at one point or another) I<br/>
don't follow that particular style so pricing isn't something I will<br/>
comment on.  The one thing I am learning is that there were a lot of<br/>
"copies" made in the early 1800's, so they are old in one respect, but<br/>
they aren't the real deal.  Then there all the copies made in the late<br/>
1800's that were more for the international/tourist markets. I don't<br/>
have a teacher and have been blowing my opportunities to be with other<br/>
collectors.  I was so excited joining the NY token kai with access to<br/>
many knowledgeable people.  But between my health issues and my kids<br/>
usually visiting me the weekend the club meets has put a huge damper<br/>
on me being able to go.  I was picking up things here and there though<br/>
and it all goes back to the iron or base metals used.  You start to<br/>
recognize the metal from the 1800's which is trying to imitate but<br/>
usually it is a bit overdone.  I wish I could spend more time with<br/>
knowledgeable folks.  I have to make my way back to the token kai. <br/>
Pricing by the way is something that I have struggled with since the<br/>
beginning.  I think it just takes time to get an idea of where a piece<br/>
price range falls into.  This is not an exact science by any means. <br/>
And unfortunately, the advice I was given on what it's worth hold<br/>
true, " it is worth whatever someone else is willing to pay for it". <br/>
Not a lot of practical help.  So much too learn.  Good luck and just<br/>
keep plugging at it.  As Jim Gilbert says just keep on looking at<br/>
them, after feeling and studying over 10,000 you will start to get an<br/>
idea.  Don't let that number discourage you, just keep at it.  Best of<br/>
 luck and remember the most important thing about collecting sword<br/>
fittings, Send all Praying Mantis themed fittings to me. LOL.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-46650151">Friends,<br/>
While we are on the subject of Shingen tsuba, and since Tom brought them<br/>
up, I have always wondered why both woven wire style and the makade style<br/>
guards are considered "Shingen." They seem basically different and<br/>
unrelated. It is simply that they both involve use of wire, or is there<br/>
something else going on?<br/>
And, BYT, to follow up Ron's comments, both of those style seem different<br/>
from those real chunky tsuba you see from time to time in which a<br/>
plane-jane sukashi iron guard has had some wire wrapped on it. These always<br/>
look to me like recent junk. Am I missing something there, too?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1784146324">Because if I didn't collect them, it would be silly to have the nickname "the mantis dude".HAHA.  it was actually my first tsuba given to me and it just took.  you can read all my symbolizing section on the site , so you can understand why  I like it from  what it represents.  It  is just something I found luckily and  have only collected it since.  It has now been a decade.  I have some more pieces that aren't on the site.  At some point I will update.  I would love pics, but those go into my personal folder.  I only post my collection and repros.  Still I collect pics that aren't in my collection as reference for myself.  I enjoy getting a new piece and having to research the school etc. helps learn a little about a different school.  I like how they are available but not so much as dragons, so they are a lot less common than some of the other designs but not so much that I can't find them at all..  Look forward to the pics.  Maybe one day I will post<br/>
 all the photos I have but that is a lot of work.  I also don't know how people feel about posting photos from their websites.  I didn't keep track of where everywhere I got them from.  Anyway, thanks again.<br/>
