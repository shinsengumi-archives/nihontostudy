<h3>New to the forum...</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-58684681">Greetings everyone,<br/>
<br/>
I am new to the forum here, at least as a contributor...  I <br/>
have "lurked" here for some time, and finally decided it was time I <br/>
joined you all in your excellent discussions.  As a "tsuba man," I <br/>
have especially appreciated the recent activity on this site.  You <br/>
are all so knowledgeable and generous with your thoughts and <br/>
comments---it certainly helps someone like me who is relatively new <br/>
to tsuba.  <br/>
<br/>
I have very much enjoyed the Kantei of recent days, and the <br/>
excellent photographs of tekkotsu that Jim has provided.  It really <br/>
helps to have such images for reference.  <br/>
<br/>
Fascinating thoughts, too, on the matter of aesthetic valuation of <br/>
tsuba in pre-Edo times.  Jim's refereces to the tea ware of the day <br/>
are intriguing as well.  <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I just wanted to introduce myself and express my <br/>
appreciation for the great activity on the board.  I will look <br/>
forward to seeing more, and to contributing a few words here and <br/>
there.  Best to all...<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1453461715">Thanks, Jim.  I'm looking forward to contributing here as well.<br/>
I am also happy to hear that you are thinking of updating your site <br/>
in the not-too-distant future.  Such a superb site, and I'm sure the <br/>
new images of mimi/tekkotsu will be invaluable for those of us who <br/>
are big on Owari and Kanayama...<br/>
