Sorry to ask this, but I was looking at an Auction, which I'm going to <br/>

or not.  Also, if it is okay, if the estimate of $120.00-180.00 is okay <br/>

I'm not sure what is going on, but every time I send something or reply <br/>

and my posts are invisible to everyone.  The other lists that I'm on, I <br/>
get some type of response from someone, and I don't feel like I'm <br/>
ignored.  If someone doesn't know, I would like to know this, if I need <br/>
to get Photos let me know, but don't ignore the questions.  There are a <br/>
lot of folks on this list which has expertise in parts of swords or full <br/>
swords and then there are folks, like myself which are learning from <br/>
asking questions and listening to the answers.  I don't have tons of <br/>
money for expensive books, what books I do have, do not cover areas <br/>
which I'm asking questions about.  So, please, if someone asks a <br/>
question, please acknowledge it, even if it is an answer like, "I don't <br/>

Hope you don't mind a tip or ten!!  This advice is based on the assumption that<br/>
you are going to use a digital camera.<br/>
- Use the highest resolution your camera is capable of.<br/>
- Study the User Manual for a CLOSEUP option use if your camera has the<br/>
function.<br/>
- Get AS MUCH of the object you want in the image (LCDscreen or viewfinder)<br/>
before taking the pic.  This gives you more pixels on what you want people to<br/>
see.<br/>
- Take as many pics as you can from different angles and distances.  It is no<br/>
joy to get home and find all your images (or the otherwise best ones) are out of<br/>
focus or have reflections off a glass case (the camera always sees what the eye<br/>
does not!!).<br/>
- Find out how to increase the exposure of your camera if it has the function.<br/>
Take extra images at +0.5, +1.0 or even +1.5 if the lighting is not bright<br/>
enough.<br/>
- Unload and carefully view all images with an image view application.  I use a<br/>
rather simple program called Microsoft PhotoEditor.  It is basic but allows<br/>
viewing at up to 400x but I hardly use any more than 150x - if your image is<br/>
beginning to pixellate at 125x then it doesn't have enough resolution.<br/>
- PhotoEditor allows one to rotate and crop images for best presentation and<br/>
viewing so people can concentrate on what you want them to see.<br/>
- Preserve the original images by renaming any image you manipulate with a<br/>
meaningful name. Resave at the highest resolution possible - the jpeg save<br/>
option in PhotoEditor, for example, should be at 100% to preserve image quality.<br/>
- I'm a rank amatuer, but if you're a professional photographer I apologise for<br/>
the imposition...<br/>
<br/>
Finally, don't post large file sizes to the list.  Put them on a hosting site<br/>
somewhere.<br/>

I have a Pentax OptioS50 with Museum Settings.  I take photos of Greek <br/>
and Roman coins up close.  I shouldn't have too much problems.  I will <br/>
probably take a White sheet of paper to set the item on.  I use <br/>
PhotoShop LE for cropping, sizing, and Adjusting.  I will double check <br/>
the photos when I'm there and at least I have Sunday to go back and take <br/>
more photos.  Tuesday is when it will go up for Auction.<br/>

If the fuchi kashira really were Goto, they'd probably be worth more than the estimates, but lots of black and gold Goto-esque kodogu of many levels of quality were produced.  Ojime are netsuke/inro-related, not Nihonto-related.   <br/>

If the fuchi kashira really were Goto, they'd probably be worth more than the estimates, but lots of black and gold Goto-esque kodogu of many levels of quality were produced.  Ojime are netsuke/inro-related, not Nihonto-related.   <br/>

  I'm not sure what is going on, but every time I send something or reply<br/>
  to someone, I don't get any response from anyone.  I kind of feel like I<br/>
  and my posts are invisible to everyone.  The other lists that I'm on, I<br/>

  ignored.  If someone doesn't know, I would like to know this, if I need<br/>
  to get Photos let me know, but don't ignore the questions.  There are a<br/>
  lot of folks on this list which has expertise in parts of swords or full<br/>
  swords and then there are folks, like myself which are learning from<br/>
  asking questions and listening to the answers.  I don't have tons of<br/>
  money for expensive books, what books I do have, do not cover areas<br/>
  which I'm asking questions about.  So, please, if someone asks a<br/>
  question, please acknowledge it, even if it is an answer like, "I don't<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> >...maybe I should pick another hobbie!  I laugh at it now but it didn't sit well...<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Had to laugh at this comment because we have all experienced this thinking somewhere along the way. Actually, I doubt that many of us "picked" this hobby; rather, I think the hobby picked those of us having that "spark," that fascination (obsession?) with ancient things needing preserving.  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> >not having a "ton of money"...<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Today, I sometimes wonder how the newer collectors bitten by this interest survive, seeing the cost of things today. Then I realize that 35 years ago when swords could be bought for $25, many of us struggled to purchase those "cheapies." Fresh out of the navy and with a new wife and baby, and making squat in salary, I had to peddle whatever could be found and then hoard those dollars for when a sword of interest was found. Fun times, indeed! So I suppose things never change.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> >Whatever you spend on books, you will save when you come to buy your pieces.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Truer words where never written! My only regrets regarding books are the books I sold off, thinking I'd never really use them. Buy they better books as they come out because once they are out-of-print, the price exculates. Yes, the internet has a wealth of information on it but there is nothing like researching a sword of kodogu with a good library at your fingertips. You recommended "educate yourself" and that is the key to advancing in our area of study. I too was told to "study, study, study" when I met my first knowledgeable person familiar with Japanese swords (Dr. Thomas Hoopes) back around 1968. <br/>

Sorry...feeling "grandfatherly" today...just had to add my few cents worth to this discussion.<br/>

                   What an absolute treat it was to get receive your e-mail!<br/>
In this vast "internet sea",  it's great addressing someone directly.  I<br/>
never had a "grandfather" so you be "grandfatherly" all you want.  Please do<br/>
not apologize for that.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for the words of encouragement. They have not fallen on deaf ears.<br/>
I am very new at this and I have already discovered some valueable lessons.<br/>
I just wanted to share that with Kim.  It can be frustrating reading of<br/>
these e-mails and not really knowing what's being said but it's a "process"<br/>
like anything else. The "learning curve" is extremely steep at this point<br/>
and there have been a few "nose bleeds",  LOL!  But like you said, "study,<br/>
study, study".<br/>
<br/>
I couldn't agree more with  "Nihonto" picking me. LOL!    O.K., "Grandfather<br/>

    pick another hobbie!  I laugh at it now but it didn't sit well with me<br/>
when<br/>
    he first told me. It forced me to re-focus my train of thought. EDUCATE<br/>
    yourself Kim. Whatever you spend on books, you will save when you come<br/>
to<br/>
    buy your pieces.<br/>
<br/>
    Your frustration came across load and clear! As a beginner, I could<br/>
relate.<br/>
    I agree with Barry, we are all busy. Do not think that you are being<br/>
    intensionally ignored.<br/>
<br/>
    Good luck in your quest. Enjoy the journey.......................<br/>

    Subject: Re: [nihontostudy] RE: Question....<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
      Hey all,<br/>
      I'm not sure what is going on, but every time I send something or<br/>
reply<br/>
      to someone, I don't get any response from anyone.  I kind of feel like<br/>
I<br/>
      and my posts are invisible to everyone.  The other lists that I'm on,<br/>
I<br/>
      get some type of response from someone, and I don't feel like I'm<br/>
      ignored.  If someone doesn't know, I would like to know this, if I<br/>
need<br/>
      to get Photos let me know, but don't ignore the questions.  There are<br/>
a<br/>
      lot of folks on this list which has expertise in parts of swords or<br/>
full<br/>
      swords and then there are folks, like myself which are learning from<br/>
      asking questions and listening to the answers.  I don't have tons of<br/>
      money for expensive books, what books I do have, do not cover areas<br/>
      which I'm asking questions about.  So, please, if someone asks a<br/>
      question, please acknowledge it, even if it is an answer like, "I<br/>
don't<br/>
      know the answer."<br/>
<br/>
      In the case of the question below, would it help in getting a photo of<br/>
      the pieces and putting it up on this list for all of you to see?<br/>
<br/>
      Sincerely,<br/>
      Kim<br/>
