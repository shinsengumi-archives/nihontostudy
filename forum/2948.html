<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-271843849">but I have been know to ask plenty of these in my life so why stand on <br/>
ceremony now :-).<br/>
<br/>
I was looking at some pitting that is on a new tsuba I picked<br/>
( either Akasaka or Tosa Myochin I think - <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.nihontomessageboard.com/personal/tsuba/akasaka2.jpg">http://www.nihontomessageboard.com/personal/tsuba/akasaka2.jpg</a> )<br/>
and it has a bit more pitting than I thought from the auction images <br/>
which is a shame.<br/>
<br/>
My question for the day then is, if we polish and restore pittings, <br/>
scratches, chips and the likes from swords, is anything like this ever <br/>
done on iron tsuba ?, I know the obvious thing is the patina but if we <br/>
can re patinate nakago, why not tsuba ( at least iron tsuba anyway ) and <br/>
are there any artisans in Japan presently making tsuba in the old ways <br/>
and using original patina recipes ?. I know Yoshindo Yoshihara sensei <br/>
does apparently, and I would love to see some examples of his work. I <br/>
was thinking about this recently, and wondered about the recipes in the <br/>
back of the Aesthetic Guide and if anyone still does this stuff. If so, <br/>
could very good tsuba with minimal damage be repaired and re patinate <br/>
and if so, how effectively.<br/>
<br/>
Right then, foot back in my mouth and over to the experts.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2128953423">Hi Richard;<br/>
<br/>
There was a tsubako at the San Fran show a couple of years ago from Japan.  He makes great sukashi tsuba.  Price in the 5K to 8K range.  He had a number of his tsuba on display, very nice work.<br/>
<br/>
There are people in the US and in Japan that can do restoration on iron tsuba, and I have had some restored in both the US and in Japan.  <br/>
<br/>
I am not certain on kinko as I have never had one done.<br/>

Repatination of tsuba can be done--correctly--but refinishing such as removing pits, etc., no, I don't think anyone would want to do that. Sometimes a terrific tsuba is found that has been buffed or whatever and then, repatination can be done to save it. Skip Holbrook used to do this but today--if I understand things correctly--only handles really high quality tsuba. We all experiement with repatination I'm sure, but care must be taken not to (further) damage an important quality tsuba. <br/>
<br/>
Several years ago a Japanese  gentleman (artist) was at one of the sword shows displaying his prize-winning newly made tsuba. His tsuba were traditionally made and quite beatufiul...and quite expensive! So there are those around today who continue the craft.<br/>

I suspect most tsuba collectors do a little " restorations ".  Getting  rid <br/>
of active rust with a little horn/ivory rub job  for example, wearing  it in <br/>
your pocket  is another.<br/>
I restored (  more than rust removal) a  tsuba that passed  Hagihara sensei's <br/>
scrutiny and passed shinsa  always brings a little grin  to my face.<br/>
Have discussed the " ways " with a few tsuba scholars/collectors, seems  like <br/>
there are a few  methods out there .  I wouldn't recommend trying  them on <br/>
good tsuba at the get go, but you can try your hands at the typical  po-edo <br/>
39.99  rusty thingie and learn about iron...................<br/>
