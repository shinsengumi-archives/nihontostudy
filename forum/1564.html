<div id="ygrps-yiv-446231473">Agreed with Gordon.  In general it's not a good idea.  <br/>
<br/>
If we're talking about the previous owner's kid playing with the sword in the back yard and getting mud all over the tsuka ito, then, yes that's better off cleaned if it's done correctly.<br/>
<br/>
If we're talking about removing "patina of use," then that is not such a good proposition.  As with all things in this field if it is done poorly it will wreck the piece.  Some of the older koshirae that I have seen certified at shinsa had buildup from use on the ito.  It's not a bad thing.  Aggressive cleaning can damage the ito and same, and that is a bad thing indeed.  <br/>
<br/>
Careful cleaning may not damage anything, but if you do it to an older tsuka, it can make it difficult or impossible to identify the true age of the piece.<br/>
<br/>
It is not your goal to make old koshirae look fresh and new.  <br/>

  I think that is not a good idea. Jim?<br/>
