<h3>Remounted swords for WW2</h3>
by <i>swordnsig</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1220848171">Hi everyone!<br/>
I once had a rather nice later Muromachi Bizen katana that had the <br/>
nakago and the mei ground down to bright metal..in fact, the end of <br/>
the nakago was ground almost to a point and a threaded post was <br/>
welded on so this blade could be mounted in one of those Meiji/Taisho <br/>
period D guard mounts.  Obviously the 'armorer' who mounted the sword <br/>
knew nothing about swords, nor cared!  I believe that, like in the US <br/>
during the war, people donated swords to the government (in the US it <br/>
was fighting knives) for issue to new officers.  I don't believe that <br/>
every 'ancestral' blade in a Gunto or Kaigunto mount was mounted by <br/>
the family of an officer with a 'family' blade.  When swords were <br/>
needed, many were donated to the cause; be it the invasion of China <br/>
and Manchuria or WW2.  That one sword told me that the armories were <br/>
merely making sharp shiny things for the military and that is as far <br/>
as their knowledge went.  This is speculation, of course, but it <br/>
makes sense to me especially with some of the swords I have seen.</div>

Dear Friends,<br/>
At the risk of making my first contribution to this list argumentative, I<br/>
must respectfully disagree with Swordnsig.<br/>
Over the years I have owned a couple of blades that were modified in Meiji<br/>
times to accommodate gunto koshirae of the era. They have always stuck me<br/>
as very well-crafted and legitimate - if unfortunate - adjustments to<br/>
changes in sword technology. Whether equipped with a thread bolts of simply<br/>
bent to fit a kyu-gunto tsuka, the work of making these adjustments is<br/>
always very carefully done so that handle is snug and graceful. Notice that<br/>
the work is always done to allow a habaki to be installed and removed as<br/>
necessary. Furthermore, the reworking on nakago is a well established part<br/>
of the nipponto traditions. Think of all the osuriage swords we see and<br/>
nakago with the remnants of wonderful old hori! Finally, I doubt that this<br/>
work was done in "armories." I assume instead that it was done by smiths<br/>
eager for the work and to please their patrons. In any case, it seems<br/>
entirely wrong to consider the swords that won the Wars again the Chinese<br/>
and the Russians as "merely ..sharp shiny things." They were well designed,<br/>
excellent weapons. Not necessarily to traditional tastes, but cutters none<br/>
the less!<br/>
