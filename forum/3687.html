 </span></blockquote>Hello Mr Danielsson, From the pics it looks like the sword in <br/>
general is genuine. All the essentials are there. The blade is so <br/>
out of polish it is hard to really comment on it. There seems to be <br/>
a large hamon based on suguha but the kissaki pics show zilch. It is <br/>
so easy to remove and replace the tsuka that I do not understand <br/>
this persons reticence. Maybe tight from rusting? So much can be <br/>
determined from the nakago that it is a pity we can not see it. John</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1273163069">Hello Patrik - <br/>
<br/>
Actually, I like the looks of this sword even though the blade condition is out-of-polish. The mountings look interesting with Higo style fuchi and kashira, nice shakudo menuki that look possibly early, nice tsuba. The blade seems to have a nice shape and the kissaki being extended makes me think possibly sue-koto possibly. The hamon as was mentioned, seems a chu-suguha. I just wonder if this could be a sue-koto Bungo blade, a wild guess considering its condition but I'll say that anyway. Hope you end up with it.<br/>

I decied to bought this sword,maybe a stupid thing to do whitout seeing it "live" .But anyway, i liked the "look" of it.....(800$ including shipping)<br/>
Talked to the owner,he had recived this sword as a gift from an older couple that had have this on the wall in their cabin, the man in that couple bought it in the 1920´s on a trip in a unknown country.<br/>
He had helped them for some years whith the garden and so, and when they decied to sell the cabin they asked him if he wanted anything from the cabin,he just did think that the sword looked nice, (no intreset in japanese swords at all), so he took that and an old TV.<br/>
He will not take the Tskua of it, he was scared that he gonna destroy it.<br/>
Hopefully i gonna recive it under this week, gonna post some pics of the tang it when i have it in my hands. (and if it says "made in China", i let you know :-)<br/>

else on this messege board but I do have an extensive "sales" background. A<br/>
couple of things come to mind before you buy this piece.<br/>
If the Seller is knowledgeable in Nihonto, then he would be painfully aware<br/>
of how important it is to the Buyer to examine the nakago. As mentioned<br/>
earlier, this should be a simple process. Taking this one step farther, "if"<br/>
the seller is knowledgeable, mabe there is something on the nakago that<br/>
he/she doesn't want you to see. This would all be related to the asking<br/>
price of course.� If the seller isn't knowledgeable, have you explained to<br/>
the seller just how simple it would be to remove the tsuka?<br/>
Just seems "odd" to me. Has anyone else out there been denied access to a<br/>
nakago?� I'm curious.<br/>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-928211813">Hi Mark -<br/>
<br/>
As Patrik wrote a few messages ago, he has purhased the sword and at the <br/>
price, I would think he could not had gone wrong with it. Will be quite <br/>
interesting to see if the blade has a mei or not! (Trying to get an atari <br/>
with my Bungo-to thought!)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> >Has anyone else out there been denied access to a nakago? I'm curious.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>In the past fast-approaching 40 years (now that sound scarey!!) I would <br/>
suspect I've been denied access to a nakago perhaps half-dozen times. If you <br/>
have the opportunity to have the sword in-hand, then at least you can make a <br/>
judgement from the blade's quality. If buying it from a photo, well, it is a <br/>
gamble and would certainly limit how much you would offer for it because of <br/>
that gamble. I've found that most "owners" will, if you explain it to them <br/>
in a knowledgeable and polite manner, will allow the tsuka to be removed. If <br/>
buying through the mail, once they learn about the possibility of a <br/>
signature, curiosity usually takes over and off comes the tsuka. (Always <br/>
important to give clear instructions for doing this such as protecting <br/>
habaki, tsuba, etc., from excessive force!)<br/>
<br/>
When looking at a sword that's presented to you, it is always advisable --  <br/>
for your own education -- to make a judgement about the blade before looking <br/>
at the nakago. That alone can save you some money by being dazzled by a "big <br/>
mei." All fun stuff!!<br/>

Hi Patrik,<br/>
I am not nearly as knowledgeable in Nihonto as everyone<br/>
else on this messege board but I do have an extensive "sales" background. A<br/>
couple of things come to mind before you buy this piece.<br/>
If the Seller is knowledgeable in Nihonto, then he would be painfully aware<br/>
of how important it is to the Buyer to examine the nakago. As mentioned<br/>
earlier, this should be a simple process. Taking this one step farther, "if"<br/>
the seller is knowledgeable, mabe there is something on the nakago that<br/>
he/she doesn't want you to see. This would all be related to the asking<br/>
price of course. If the seller isn't knowledgeable, have you explained to<br/>
the seller just how simple it would be to remove the tsuka?<br/>
Just seems "odd" to me. Has anyone else out there been denied access to a<br/>
nakago? I'm curious.<br/>
<br/>
Mark Jaillet<br/>

<br/>
Hi Mark -<br/>
<br/>
As Patrik wrote a few messages ago, he has purhased the sword and at the<br/>
price, I would think he could not had gone wrong with it. Will be quite<br/>
interesting to see if the blade has a mei or not! (Trying to get an atari<br/>
with my Bungo-to thought!)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> >Has anyone else out there been denied access to a nakago? I'm curious.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>In the past fast-approaching 40 years (now that sound scarey!!) I would<br/>
suspect I've been denied access to a nakago perhaps half-dozen times. If you<br/>
have the opportunity to have the sword in-hand, then at least you can make a<br/>
judgement from the blade's quality. If buying it from a photo, well, it is a<br/>
gamble and would certainly limit how much you would offer for it because of<br/>
that gamble. I've found that most "owners" will, if you explain it to them<br/>
in a knowledgeable and polite manner, will allow the tsuka to be removed. If<br/>
buying through the mail, once they learn about the possibility of a<br/>
signature, curiosity usually takes over and off comes the tsuka. (Always<br/>
important to give clear instructions for doing this such as protecting<br/>
habaki, tsuba, etc., from excessive force!)<br/>
<br/>
When looking at a sword that's presented to you, it is always advisable -- <br/>
for your own education -- to make a judgement about the blade before looking<br/>
at the nakago. That alone can save you some money by being dazzled by a "big<br/>
mei." All fun stuff!!<br/>
<br/>
