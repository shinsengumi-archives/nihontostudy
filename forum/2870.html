<div id="ygrps-yiv-806419242">Nice tsuba, Dirk. I would not call this Kaga work, more likely Yoshiro or simply Heianjo zogan (if not Yoshiro). The kogai hitsuana looks very Kyoto to me. I also think Yoshiro work was "outlined" with chisel marks...not sure about that. (Maybe that was a way to distinguish between Yoshiro and Onin? Suspect Onin work was done that way.) Sorry to be sound so confusing here. Nice overlapping zogan...my guess is Yoshiro. <br/>

Sorry. When I said Kaga and the Yoshiro, I meant Kaga Yoshiro and the Yoshiro of Kyoto area. (I think that's right, right?)<br/>
<br/>
When thinking Kaga Yoshiro, I've had the impression that more often they would have squarish-type hitsuana; these are conventional shape with the kogai histsu being very "rounded/drilled-like" as you see on many of the Kyo-sukashi tsuba. That was my thinking here. Not sure why, but I also thought Kaga Yoshiro tsuba were more of a thinner plate than the others, but I'm not sure where that idea came from. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1701218877">Well, the karakusa leaf does remind me of Kaga-Fushimi work.  My sample of ONE<br/>
was a 2 inch kojiri on a katana I once had.  I saw similar work in one of Bob<br/>
Haynes' catalogues that he called Kaga Fushimi.  That's the beginning and end of<br/>
my knowledge on this, except that I do have a Heianjo/Yoshiro zogan tsuba the<br/>
same as the one in Gary D. Murtha's Vol 1 (? - maybe Vol 2).  Oh, in Kaga<br/>
Fushimi work the leaves were modelled in a copper-like alloy and the veins<br/>
incised, so the resemblance in this case is only superficial.  I'm not making an<br/>
authoritative statement here...<br/>

<h3>Re: [nihontostudy] yoshiro school tsuba?</h3>
by <i>sworddad</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-245470128">This discussion would make such an interesting article if put together, for the JSS/US Newsletter. I can envision perhaps a dozen examples of zogan tsuba, representative of where it began to be used through to the more common Kyo-zogan work of mid-Edo. It seems Jim, Alan Harvie and Bob Haynes did this at one of the SF shows two or three years ago. Perhaps such a "comparison" or "evolution of the technique" has already been put together? If so, it would be a wonderful article to see in print for sharing. Comments?<br/>

  When I said Kaga I meant Kaga-zogan and early, I don't think it is Kaga<br/>
  Yoshiro, I don't have the image now so I can't check my first impression.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-779708627">Ron, Alan and all, another one that draws both sides to comment. I think <br/>
this is late Muromachi/very early Edo Heianjô Zogan. Others on this list <br/>
agree whilst still others on this list think Kaga Yoshiro. I can see <br/>
bit's of both in each, this is about 2mm thick and about 8.5 x 8 cm, it <br/>
is heavy and looks to be sand iron, I think<br/>
