<h3>color of Momoyama Kanayama tsuba</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1509817423">In reading Sasano, I see that he frequently speaks of the color of a <br/>

it is difficult to actually see what he means when he makes such <br/>

compared to Kanayama guards of earlier times.  I was just wondering if <br/>
this is the consensus among those of you who have much experience with <br/>

Color is probably the most difficult kantei datum.  The color of iron tsuba has often been changed (passively or actively), it depends on the light used to view or photograph and depends very much on the perception of the observer.  I would suggest concentrating on everything else in dating Kanayama tsuba before considering color.<br/>
<br/>
With that caution, I think that early Kanayama do not tend to show a reddish tone.  Not all Momoyama ones are reddish in my experience, but some are.  So, the observation is valid, but it is not definitive in my opinion.<br/>
<br/>
If you do try to evaluate iron color use direct but not dazzling sunlight.<br/>

Many years ago a man once offered me a number of iron tsuba in trade for a tanto<br/>
I had that he desired.  One was iron of very nice work with gold inlay in<br/>
snowflake patterns, but the colour of the iron was odd.  It just didn't "look<br/>
right".  It was sort of greyish.  I commented on this and the fellow freely<br/>
admitted he had cleaned and restored the tsuba with gun blue... GONG...  I kept<br/>
the tanto.  I just want to highlight Jim's advice that colour is probably the<br/>
most difficult kantei datum.  This also applies to shakudo.  I won't buy<br/>
anything in soft metal unless the colour is right, as there were so many grades<br/>
of quality - 15, if I recall correctly, for shakudo alone...<br/>
<br/>
So for me it is a combination of the art level of a piece (quality of work) and<br/>
colour and condition of the metal.  I offer for your inspection a pair of menuki<br/>
I have of Nio.  Now, I know these are almost identical to repro menuki sold by<br/>
Fred Lohman, and I got a real shock to see these in his catalogue.  However,<br/>
mine are real as I have an NBTHK old green paper attributing them to Mito kuni.<br/>
I sent them to the first USA NBTHK Shinsa way back when.  Here is the link:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://ph.groups.yahoo.com/group/nihontostudy/photos/browse/301b?c">http://ph.groups.yahoo.com/group/nihontostudy/photos/browse/301b?c</a><br/>
<br/>
I've put a couple of other menuki there as well.  A pair of Yanagawa tigers<br/>
(papered) and a pair of Goto shishi (not papered - my guess as to school)<br/>
<br/>
The NIO menuki I found in a sword that was otherwise a crapper in every respect.<br/>
The wakizashi blade had a humungously bad dragon carved to hide a flaw (it<br/>
didn't!!).  The tsuba was a rank, and I mean RANK, very ordinaire piece of scrap<br/>
metal (but old, mates, old...).  The fuchigashira were crudely made plain brass,<br/>
and the saya was a leather over wood WW2 'creation'.  But I could easily see<br/>
these menuki were SUPERB.  I could never understand why and how they came to be<br/>
there amongst the dross...<br/>
<br/>
The Yanagawa tiger menuki were likewise in an otherwise very ordinary wakizashi<br/>
in gunto "civilian" koshirae.<br/>
<br/>
I bought a katana just to get the Goto shishi menuki.  The blade was signed<br/>
NOBUKUNI and dated to 1400-something.  BUT - the hamon dropped off the cutting<br/>
edge and the nakago was savagely rusted.  This was a severely tired old blade.<br/>
The tsuba was a Shonai iron piece with Shoki the demon queller.  All the<br/>
patinated metal on the tsuba had been polished back to bright copper.  Now, some<br/>
30 years later, it is looking quite decent.  The shishi menuki, however, were<br/>
mint apart from some "lashings" of a solvent glue used to hold the tsukaito<br/>
together.<br/>
<br/>
Best regards,<br/>
