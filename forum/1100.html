<div id="ygrps-yiv-2039182437">Still reading all this wonderful stuff written by Mr. Caldwell and I<br/>
have run into a couple of things I do not understand and / or<br/>
comprehend, so no better place than to pose my questions here.<br/>
 <br/>
On page 39 he writes about the Shinto smiths using alot of Namban tetsu<br/>
and says "There was less molybdenum and more chrome (In Namban steel)<br/>
than native Japaneses iron and this made for a stronger and sharper<br/>
blade than the old iron, with less forging." <br/>
 <br/>
1.     - What is molybdenum and why does this in conjunction with chrome<br/>
make for a stronger and sharper blade with less forging  ?<br/>
 <br/>
Mr. Caldwell goes on to say that Koto swords rust differently than<br/>
Shinto swords<br/>
 <br/>
2.     - Again what does he mean and can anyone give me an example ? I<br/>
presume this has to do with the fact that Shinto steel is quite<br/>
different to Koto steel, with most of it being Namban or a variation<br/>
thereof as described in question 1. <br/>
 <br/>
3.    - Last but not least he describes Koto blades as being "blue". Now<br/>
I have seen a couple and would agree that they do look bluish. Is this<br/>
why people sometimes call them "wet" ? Also if you had to assign a color<br/>
to Shinto blades what would it be ?<br/>
 <br/>

hardening/strengthening effects on steel.<br/>

My Kawasaki KLX300 dirtbike (former) has a frame of chromoly, which is<br/>
a chromium/molybdenum/iron alloy. From some comments "heat treated<br/>
chromoly steel won't crack or bend."<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1609921894">Hi Matt,<br/>
 <br/>
I think the nugui at the end of the polishing process has something to do with colour, and rust inhibition.  I have read somewhere that a blade not treated with nugui will rust more quickly.  Also, nugui, and the mixture of the nugui  by the polisher helps determine the final "colour" of the steel, although the colour of the steel is always there of course  - the nugui just accentuates activities and steel colour among other things.  <br/>
 <br/>
As steel, polishers techniques, owner, and environmental conditions differ, I think this is why we see different finishes and finish colours on blades.  I will agree that just about every koto blade that I have seen has a bluish colour to the steel.    And, i dont think that blades with bluish colour to them stopped being producecd as soon as the koto period ended, and vise versa,  I have a shinto blade that has a very pronounced bluish colour to it.  Aging of the steel may also have an effect.<br/>
<br/>
Lighting may also have an effect on the colour of the steel.  I have a koto wak that looks like it has blackish steel under a compact flourescent bulb, yet looks very bluish under every other light.<br/>
 <br/>
Also, care of the blades has an effect on the appearance of the steel and activites and polish in general.  A blade has to be looked after properly, especially in the first few months after a polish.  Applications of uchiko and just general sword maintenace enhance the polish overall.  Water still remains in a blade for a period of time after a polish, so it must be removed, and, like a fine wine, and through uchiko applications a blade ages and we start to see things that werent as obvious as before.<br/>
 <br/>
Just some thoughts, and I am rambling so I will shut up now.<br/>
 <br/>
Regards,<br/>

The CFB should have a greater blue component in its spectrum than an<br/>

Interesting.  Does it look like the early Soshu "wetness" or is it<br/>
different?<br/>

<br/>
  Kyushu products are called wet or even viscous with a look as if they are<br/>
  covered in clear glue. I am not sure why this happens as I an not into<br/>
  metallurgy. It is not due to ji-nie, because ji-nie is not common in such<br/>
  Kyushu works - excepting the Samonji school. It is probably due to the<br/>
type<br/>
  of sand iron available in Kyushu during the Koto period. This feature<br/>
  disappears during the Shinto period due to changes in iron manufacturing<br/>
and<br/>
  the importation of foreign iron.<br/>
