<h3>Masanori confusion</h3>
by <i>retalt</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-581012662">Greetings all, I am looking into the shinto smith Masanori ( yamato no daijo fujiwara masanori ). In Fujishiro's, they place the Shodai in Genna ( 1615 ) and the Nidai in Kanban ( 1661 ) They also have a yamato no daijo masanori listed in Kan'ei ( 1624 ) who may or may not be the Nidia. There would seem to be quite a bit of difference in time between 1624 and 1661, I mean buy that, he would have either been pretty young if he was in fact the smith working in 1623 or pretty old when listed as the Nidai. <br/>
<br/>
I then also have volume 47 of Token Shibata which has an excellent example of the Shodai's work in it and it places it at Keichô ( 1596 )<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone have any clarification on when the Shodai and Nidai worked ?, and does Fujishiro's date them according to title. i.e. the Nidai received the Daijo title in 1661 so that is the date Fujishiro listed him from.<br/>
<br/>
cheers all<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1753548759">To expand upon this question, I'd love to know how to tell the difference between shodai mei and nidai mei.  Mike Quigley pointed this out to me once on a Masanori of mine but honestly, I did not grasp the tell-tale differences.  <br/>
