<br/>
Good time to see if anyone exists out there...no messages for several days?<br/>
<br/>
What is the name of the story depicting a warrior chasing an oni who has stolen his stupa (shrine)? I used to know this but can't locate that info anywhere. <br/>

There is a famous set of menuki with this theme by Goto Yujo. One is in the Maeda <br/>
collection and the other is in a private collection. In Japanese the motif is called <br/>
Idaten Ki or swift running heavenly warrior and demon. I don't know if there is an <br/>
accompanying story.<br/>

Idaten {e-dah-ten}, or Skanda in Skt., one of the many guardian deities for the Lord Buddha known as a swift-runner. Legend asserts that he runs so fast that he was able to catch the thieves who stole Sakyamuni's ashes. Statues of Idaten are often installed in kitchens or priests' living quarter of Zen temples. The statue is 87 centimeters tall and was carved in the 14th century. Sculptors unknown. Both are ICAs designated by the City of Kamakura.<br/>
