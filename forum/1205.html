Offhand Shingen is the only one that comes to mind.  This one seems a bit unusual, as they mostly covered the whole sukashi plate in wire.  Some of the tsuba they used were very good sukashi tsuba.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1882285052">I think that what Rich called the "rail/nail" type is what's often called mukade, or centipede tsuba.  The so-called Shingen guards are wire wrapped, sometimes so heavily that none of the underlying sukashi tsuba is visible.  Others, like the one Peter posted, will have some of the guard covered with a brass plate and/or fukurin.  I'm not aware of another term for this type of tsuba other than Shingen.  However, there's no evidence that this style of tsuba had anything to do with Takeda Shingen, and if anything probably dates from the Bakumatsu period or later.<br/>

Rich, since you now have the 2nd ed. of Tsuba Kanshoki, flip to the end of the book to find a section titled "I will show here some poor samples as follows lest you should get such ones."  The bottom of page 387 shows one of the full wrap "Shingen" tsuba and p. 389 has a mukade example.  A lot of the old European collections had big, heavily wrapped Shingen tsuba.  Whoever was making them seems to have created a market.<br/>

I thought the iron of the mimi looked good, or aged ?, possibly with bones, but it was the interesting quality :-) or lack of it ? in the wire work that caught my attention.<br/>

	It doesn't look that old to me either but I like it. I believe I read <br/>
in Fukunaga that Shingen's corps of top-notch troops was the <br/>
"Mukade-tai" , not sure of the tai bit, they were used as guard and <br/>
personal messenger for the commander. Besides the hata-jirushi (flag) <br/>
they were privileged to wear a mukade tsuba. My recollection is that it <br/>
is not certain what the actual design was but were held to be instantly <br/>
recognizable. Most examples are from much later times but there are one <br/>
or two of the "wired" design that have the right age but there is no <br/>
evidence linking them concretely to Shingen or this group.<br/>
	I wrote this up for the NCJSC some years back so do not remember what <br/>
all it said or which issue it was in...<br/>
