The knife style is called Bade-Bade or Battig or Roentjau or I have <br/>
seen it written roentgon or something close to that.  It is a Malayan <br/>
knife.  Sometimes they are single and sometimes double edged.  They <br/>
can be found in the Celebes, Acheen, West Borneo, Sumatra and I am <br/>
sure Indonesia.  I am certain that this particular blade is a <br/>
Japanese blade that was modified to fit into this style of mounting.  <br/>
They Malay are a seafaring people who did business with virtually <br/>
everyone in SE Asia and the Pacific Isles.  It is entirely possible <br/>
the blade was traded for, bought or even stolen as pirate booty.  It <br/>
is an interesting amalgamation of styles!  I have never seen one like <br/>
this, but I am not surprised considering the trading and pirating <br/>
skills of the Malay people!<br/>

  The knife style is called Bade-Bade or Battig or Roentjau or I have <br/>
  seen it written roentgon or something close to that.  It is a Malayan <br/>
  knife.  Sometimes they are single and sometimes double edged.  They <br/>
  can be found in the Celebes, Acheen, West Borneo, Sumatra and I am <br/>
  sure Indonesia.  I am certain that this particular blade is a <br/>
  Japanese blade that was modified to fit into this style of mounting.  <br/>
  They Malay are a seafaring people who did business with virtually <br/>
  everyone in SE Asia and the Pacific Isles.  It is entirely possible <br/>
  the blade was traded for, bought or even stolen as pirate booty.  It <br/>
  is an interesting amalgamation of styles!  I have never seen one like <br/>
  this, but I am not surprised considering the trading and pirating <br/>
  skills of the Malay people!<br/>
