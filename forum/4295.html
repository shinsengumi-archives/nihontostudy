<br/>
I am curious why this is papered to Myochin as opposed to Katchushi (or <br/>
Tosho for that matter).  I would suppose it has to do with the metal <br/>
which of course will make it difficult to tell from scans.  Any help <br/>
appreciated. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-202703044">Pete, Alan and all. From my understanding, there is a relationship in <br/>
the pre Edo work between Tosho, Katchushi and Myochin that crosses over <br/>
and can blur the lines of separation for these 3 groups. There is a <br/>
theory that the Myochin family was the creator of Katchushi but in <br/>
reading Torigoye/Haynes they state there is no real evidence for this. <br/>
The iron is also stated to be better quality in the Katchushi/Myochin <br/>
tsuba than in Tosho so maybe here is something in there that the NBTHK <br/>
saw that we cannot see in the photo's ?<br/>
<br/>
The similarities that this guard has with Tosho though are too close for <br/>
me the fathom the reason it is called Myochin. I think Jim is away in <br/>
the swamp again so he may not answer. Perhaps Gordon is here and can <br/>
shed some light maybe ?. mate ???.<br/>
<br/>
good question.<br/>
