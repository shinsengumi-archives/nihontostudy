<h3>sword attack</h3>
by <i>excelsiorilluminati</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1782813657">Hello All, These attacks on people with 'Samurai Swords' are the exact <br/>
reason there has been legislation enacted already with more being <br/>
contemplated in certain parts of the world. It isn't until legislators <br/>
and the population in general realise that if it wasn't these cheap <br/>
replica edged weapons being used it would be something else just just <br/>
as deadly, eg. machete, axe etc. In fact most violent crime is <br/>
committed with weapons of chance (those that are to hand during fits <br/>
of rage) and those crimes of violence committed by persons who make <br/>
conscious use of a weapon in a planned way would in no way be stopped <br/>
from their crime by legislation that bans or restricts legitimate <br/>
collectors rights. This affects us and we should be aware that some <br/>
would believe that legislating against possession of edged weapons <br/>
would make society safer. John</div>

<h3>tekkotsu question</h3>
by <i>retalt</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1465397726">greetings all. Recently, and somewhere, I read that tekkotsu in the <br/>
corners of square tsuba was peculiar to one or two tsuba ha. I think <br/>
maybe Ko Shoami was one, I can't remember the other. Does anyone have <br/>
information on this ?, I am stumped as to where I read it, I have been <br/>
through my books 1/2 a dozen times over the weekend and cannot find it <br/>
for the life of me.<br/>
<br/>
any help appreciated<br/>
<br/>
cheers<br/>
<br/>

<h3>Commercial Message, Rare WW2 Japanese Diplomat sword</h3>
by <i>lshobie</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1247583030">Hello,<br/>
<br/>
I have just added a pretty rare sword to my site. Although it isn't true nihonto, it is a WW2 era Japanese Diplomatic Officers sword. We seldom see these swords, especially in this condition. It seems to be a copy of a British designed court sword.<br/>
