<h3>PROBLEM ON YOUR WEBSITE??</h3>

<br/>
I'm commending your website to a wealthy man who wants to buy  a "faultless <br/>
example" of a Japanese sword.  He won't talk to me directly, only through an <br/>
arms dealer friend of his who has asked me to help out as he himself knows <br/>
nothing about Nihonto.  I find this very unsatisfactory and have declined to <br/>
help out.  However, I'm writing an email to the bloke I know who is the <br/>
friend of the wealthy man outlining my reasons for not engaging, pointing <br/>
out the difficulties involved, and recommending his friend/customer do his <br/>
own internet research.<br/>
<br/>
So, I'm looking at your site to give a "pointer" example of a good sword to <br/>
buy with koshirae, and discovered this:<br/>
<br/>
Ryumon Nobuyoshi<br/>
Kamakura Koto (ca. 1288), with koshirae<br/>
NBTHK Juyo Token, a particularly important piece.<br/>
$74,000 -consignment-<br/>
<br/>
Trouble is, the link on the sword name Ryumon Nobuyoshi to more detail is:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.nihonto.ca/taima/">http://www.nihonto.ca/taima/</a><br/>
<br/>
which is of course the link to the Yamato Taima/Taema below.  However, the <br/>
link on the blade itself is correct.<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.nihonto.ca/ryumon-nobuyoshi/">http://www.nihonto.ca/ryumon-nobuyoshi/</a><br/>
<br/>
Best regards,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-373513783">Apologies to all for not being more careful sending a private email.  I know I enjoy others' mistakes for the "juicy bits" revealed, but it gives me no joy to do it myself.  Grrrr....<br/>
