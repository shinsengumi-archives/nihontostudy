<h3>Tsouba newbie</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-36942339">Hi all.<br/>
<br/>
I found this group via the excellent <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://home.earthlink.net/">http://home.earthlink.net/</a><br/>
~jggilbert/tsuba.htm and I was hoping you could tell me a bit about my <br/>
first tsuba. A relative picked it up at a flea market, hoping to mount <br/>
it on a drawer, but now it's mine :-).<br/>
<br/>
I've looked through the above site, but I'm having trouble both dating <br/>
it and determining the style. I know the leaves and flower are <br/>
chrysanthemum, but that's about it. It's 85 mm (3.35 in) in diameter <br/>
and weighs 96 gram (3.39 oz). I can't find any characters engraved on <br/>
either side or the rim. I'm guessing it's made of iron with patches of <br/>
gold leaf.<br/>
<br/>
The link to the front is <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://tinyurl.com/d9fvq">http://tinyurl.com/d9fvq</a> and to the back is <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://tinyurl.com/b6643">http://tinyurl.com/b6643</a> . My lack of photography skills is legendary, <br/>
 so please ignore the level differences and let me know if better <br/>
pictures are required.<br/>
<br/>
I doubt there's much market in my area for this type of item and I'm <br/>
definitely keeping it for the novelty, but I'd be curious to know if <br/>
it's worth 50 cents or 5 dollars.<br/>
<br/>
That's all for now, thanks in advance for any comments.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1661417823">Hi Peter, welcome to the group. My guess would be that it is Shoami, and <br/>
most probably, Kyo Shoami. Nice floral these, we can't tell a lot about <br/>
the iron due to the colour of your photo's unfortunately but if in good <br/>
condition without cracks or serous damage, then this sort of thing might <br/>
sell on Ebay for between $300 - $400.00<br/>
<br/>
Jim's site has a section on Shoami tsuba I believe.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Thanks for the quick replies, Richard and klepet. I've uploaded better <br/>
pictures at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://tinyurl.com/8vzen">http://tinyurl.com/8vzen</a> and <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://tinyurl.com/brcqz">http://tinyurl.com/brcqz</a> . My <br/>
mother only paid about $10 for it.<br/>
<br/>
I've got a couple of questions, if you don't mind.<br/>
<br/>
If it's Kyo Shoami, does that mean it was made in Kyoto? Am I right in <br/>
guessing that it's from the early Edo period? 1650ish?<br/>
<br/>
The Kogai Hitsu-ana is filled out like on many other Tsuba I've seen <br/>
pictures of online. Was this done to enforce the structure or as part <br/>
of repairs or for some other reason? Would it have happened much later <br/>
in time? The same goes for the fillers in the Nakago-ana.<br/>
<br/>
Were all Tsuba mounted on weapons or were they used elsewhere as e.g. <br/>
decoration? Any chance mine might've seen battle? :-)<br/>
<br/>
I'm reading up on the topic, but I'm sure I'll think of other <br/>
questions.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again,<br/>
<br/>

<h3>Re: Tsuba questions</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1048374264">Hi Petter, ok. That's a nice tsuba for $10.00, be very happy with it.<br/>
<br/>
Kyo  does refer to Kyoto, as Kyoto was the political hub of Japan during <br/>
the Muromachi period. So Kyo Sukashi works may have started in the mid <br/>
late 1400's but I am unsure if Kyo Shoami started that early but they <br/>
certainly began in the late Muromachi era.<br/>
<br/>
You guard looks typical of the late 17th to early 18th century pieces I <br/>
think. That's just my hunch. I may be wrong.<br/>
<br/>
Hitsu ana Ume were used to fill the Hitsu ana when there were no Kozuka <br/>
or Kogai used on the koshirae. It was an aesthetic thing I think. No <br/>
need for holes when there's nothing to put in them. In your tsubas case, <br/>
there would have been a Kozuka, but no Kogai, so the Kogai hole was <br/>
filled, with Shakudo covered copper mostly.<br/>
<br/>
The Sekigane that fills the nakago ana is a packer or filler to ensure <br/>
the blade fits snugly on the nakago. This tsuba was most likely been <br/>
fitted to a second or even third sword in it's life.<br/>
<br/>
I have seen furniture from the Meiji period were tsuba have been mounted <br/>
in door of cabinets and the likes but I don't think they wore them as <br/>
pendants if that's what you mean :-) I think they were used mostly as <br/>
tsuba. Though I think a few very special pieces ( Maybe Ko Goto and the <br/>
likes ) were probably stored away and kept in safe places.<br/>
<br/>
There were not to many wars in Japan after the Tokugawa took over so it <br/>
is unlikely this tsuba has seen battle, unless a one on one.<br/>
<br/>
hope that helps some.<br/>

<h3>Re: Tsuba questions</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1149205889">Just a little chronology with help from Dr. Torigoye.  <br/>
Apparently the Ko-Shoami School developed out of the Katchushi tsubako <br/>
in the late Muromachi Jidai.  After the hostilities ended with Edo <br/>
Jidai emerging there was a dispersal of the Shoami School to different <br/>
regions of Japan with the remaining Kyoto artisans being the Kyo-<br/>
Shoami.  (Kyo-sukashi and Heianjo-sukashi developed in Kyoto during <br/>
Momoyama Jidai and into Edo until they more or less merged).  <br/>
Just a note -- the tsuba of Petter could also very well be Bizen Shoami <br/>
as they had similar styles with the Kyo-Shoami in sukashi and nunome.  <br/>
Dr. Torigoye mentioned the mimi thickness was a delineating point of <br/>
reference, the Bizen being slightly thicker.  I am not certain if this <br/>
style was used in the Ko-Shoami but a note of interest is that the gold <br/>
nunome of the older pieces apparently was accomplished with greater <br/>
skill so that pieces of greater age often have more of the nunome left <br/>
as opposed to the later Edo school pieces.<br/>
(OK -- did I get that right, Jim?)(BIG LOL)</div>
