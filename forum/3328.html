<h3>Don Myrna of Gaijin&#39;s Guide Videos</h3>
by <i>sigp210</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1624888414">Apologies for bringing this here, but I was wondering if anyone has<br/>
any contact details besides the website email for Don Myrna of the<br/>
Gaijin's Guide series of videos?<br/>
A friend ordered the videos from him way back in February, and they<br/>
never arrived. Numerous false promises of replacements and various<br/>
excuses and invalid tracking numbers have left me thinking he is a<br/>
fraud or a conman that sometimes sends them, and sometimes doesn't.<br/>
Email comms have stopped, and he is avoiding all attempts to sort this<br/>
out. Some people have reported that they received theirs, but I have<br/>
found 3 other people that have never received their videos, and have<br/>
had similar excuses about the postal services etc.<br/>
I have exhausted all other options, and am fairly confident in my<br/>
theory, not just making blind accusations. Does anyone else have<br/>
similar experiences?<br/>
I would caution anyone else against dealing with him unless you are<br/>
certain you will receive your videos. He seems to con mainly<br/>
international buyers. Seems well known, (and even respected by some)<br/>
so not sure why the difficulties. <br/>
Does anyone have a reliable alternate source for the videos?<br/>
Going to do what I have to, to get my friend sorted out. I pointed<br/>
them out to him, and helped with Paypal payment, so feel obligated to<br/>
assist.<br/>
<br/>
Many thanks,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-51227268">I bought 6 videos from this man just over two years ago.  There were lots of<br/>
issues but none of them due to dishonesty on his part.  I had numerous very<br/>
cordial email exchanges with Don and he went to no end of trouble to ensure I<br/>
got my tapes.  They turned up in the end after a slow surface mail journey (my<br/>
request).  It's a long story but in short I would give Don the benefit of the<br/>
doubt and give him every chance to remedy whatever situation has occurred<br/>
outside his control.<br/>
