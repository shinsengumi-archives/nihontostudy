Dear Mr Hoyle<br/>
<br/>
Comments on the Proposed Control of Weapons (Amendment) Regulations 2003<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for your email of 14 August 2003 to Mr Chris Shea of the<br/>
Department of Justice regarding the proposed Control of Weapons<br/>
(Amendment) Regulations 2003.<br/>
<br/>
Your views have been noted and will be considered by the Minister for<br/>
Police and Emergency Services when assessing what action to take on the<br/>
proposed Regulations.<br/>
<br/>
I would note that the proposed Regulations propose to make swords a<br/>
"prohibited weapon". The lawful use and possession of a "prohibited<br/>
weapon" requires an Approval from the Chief Commissioner of Police (for<br/>
which a fee is charged). Persons may be exempted from this requirement<br/>
by the Governor-in-Council. A person, therefore, under the proposed<br/>
Regulations, could still lawfully own and possess a sword if, for<br/>
example, they obtained an Approval to do so from the Chief Commissioner<br/>
of Police.<br/>
<br/>
The proposed Regulations will not necessitate destruction of swords. In<br/>
the event that the proposed Regulations come into operation, persons in<br/>
possession of a sword who do not obtain an Approval from the Chief<br/>
Commissioner of Police and who do not fall under an exemption granted by<br/>
the Governor-in-Council could dispose of their weapons through, for<br/>
example, an authorised weapons trader.<br/>
<br/>
The Regulatory Impact Statement (RIS) which assesses the impact of the<br/>
proposed Regulations has been publicly released and I attach a copy of<br/>
the RIS for your information. Should you wish to make a further<br/>
submission on the proposed Regulations after reading the RIS (the<br/>
proposed Regulations themselves are at Attachment 1 to the RIS) you<br/>
would be most welcome to do so. The closing date for submissions is<br/>
Monday 8 September 2003. Details on how to make a submission can be<br/>
found in the RIS.<br/>
<br/>
Further copies of the Regulatory Impact Statement can be accessed on the<br/>
internet at www.justice.vic.gov.au<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for raising your views with the Department of Justice.<br/>
<br/>
Yours sincerely<br/>
<br/>

  Thank you for your email of 14 August 2003 to Mr Chris Shea of the<br/>

that a Japanese art sword potentially worth tens or hundreds of <br/>
thousands of dollars is a dangerous weapon that needs to be locked up. <br/>
In the past 20 or so years in Victoria, how many attacks with katana <br/>
have been recorded? How many with kitchen knives? Perhaps these should <br/>
be locked up too. Sounds like government regulators running amuck.<br/>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-607074275">In the latest Guns & Ammo magazine, I was reading of a new program in which dealers in firearms and hunting equipment voluntarily donate 1% of a sale to the National Rifle Association, or offer a 1% discount to NRA members.  <br/>
<br/>
If we in the United States are to continue to be permitted to own Japanese swords in the future, this will happen because the National Rifle Association successfully defended the right to keep and bear arms in the firearms context.  If and when private ownership of most firearms is prohibited, it will only be a short time (as the case of Australia demonstrates) before the same policies are extended to other collectable weapons, including Nihonto.  <br/>
<br/>
Obviously, complete political mobilization of every single Nihonto collector in the United States would produce no effective result.  That constituency is far too small to have any significant influence.  The real battle will be fought and decided over gun control.  Japanese swords will  be only a small regulatory afterthought. Nihonto collectors need to reflect, and realize that the NRA is even now fighting their fight too.  Every Japanese sword owner should join and support the NRA, and I would suggest that the sword dealing community give serious thought to subscribing to that 1% to the NRA program.<br/>

<h3>Re: [nihontostudy] FW: Regulatory Impact Statement on proposed Regulations (Ozzland sword ban!)</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1950787006">I don't think Nihonto is particularly on the NRA's radar specifically.  But it is the same issue fundamentally, the private possession of arms, whether the particular arms under consideration consist of the Pennsylvania farmer's hunting rifle, or the SF Bay area tech mogul's Ichimonji daito.  My point was that the most effective lobbying organization on the basic issue is the National Rifle Association, whose membership typically runs between three and four million, and whose membership is well know to turn out and vote.  <br/>
<br/>
If the NRA loses the fight over so-called assault weapons, then they will come after handguns.  If we lose on handguns, then they will go after rifles and shotguns.  And when all the firearms are on the prohibited list, as in Australia, swords, including Nihonto, will be added.   Those who collect antique arms would be well advised to participate in the fight now while they still have a large enough general constituency of hunters, target shooters, and ordinary firearms owners on the same side to constitute a constituency capable of making an electoral impact, and really influencing the politics of the situation.<br/>
<br/>
I don't imagine that the NRA's organizational leadership is very conscious of the Nihonto collecting community at the present time, but I'm sure the NRA philosophically regards the right to own and collect Nihonto as part of the same general right to keep and bear arms it devotes most of its energy and resources toward defending.  If American Nihonto organizations were inclined to work with the NRA on Second Amendment issues, I'm sure that the NRA would welcome their assistance.<br/>
<br/>
I don't know the inside story, but I seem to recall that the NRA was involved in publishing Man at Arms, the general arms collecting magazine, recently for some period of time, presumably to keep that journal afloat.  A feature on Japanese swords might not fit in terribly well in the American Rifleman, but would certainly be entirely appropriate to Man at Arms.  <br/>

<br/>
  David, you might be right, but is there any evidence that nihonto is on NRA's radar? Have they produced any white papers on nihonto control? Do they have a nihonto committee? Will a search on their website hit anything related to nihonto or even swords in general? [Answer to the last question: one mention by Charleston Heston about how guns are only symbolic of our freedoms... etc.. just like swords were a thousand years ago. That's it. One word in one line in one speech.]<br/>
<br/>
  And if nihonto control will be nothing more than a regulatory afterthought, isn't it equally likely that nihonto will ESCAPE regulatory notice altogether?  I'm not convinced yet that the NRA cares one BIT about swords. <br/>

<br/>
    In the latest Guns & Ammo magazine, I was reading of a new program in which dealers in firearms and hunting equipment voluntarily donate 1% of a sale to the National Rifle Association, or offer a 1% discount to NRA members.  <br/>
<br/>
    If we in the United States are to continue to be permitted to own Japanese swords in the future, this will happen because the National Rifle Association successfully defended the right to keep and bear arms in the firearms context.  If and when private ownership of most firearms is prohibited, it will only be a short time (as the case of Australia demonstrates) before the same policies are extended to other collectable weapons, including Nihonto.  <br/>
<br/>
    Obviously, complete political mobilization of every single Nihonto collector in the United States would produce no effective result.  That constituency is far too small to have any significant influence.  The real battle will be fought and decided over gun control.  Japanese swords will  be only a small regulatory afterthought. Nihonto collectors need to reflect, and realize that the NRA is even now fighting their fight too.  Every Japanese sword owner should join and support the NRA, and I would suggest that the sword dealing community give serious thought to subscribing to that 1% to the NRA program.<br/>

      I should get one too. I note that the reply's author seems to think <br/>
      that a Japanese art sword potentially worth tens or hundreds of <br/>
      thousands of dollars is a dangerous weapon that needs to be locked up. <br/>
      In the past 20 or so years in Victoria, how many attacks with katana <br/>
      have been recorded? How many with kitchen knives? Perhaps these should <br/>
      be locked up too. Sounds like government regulators running amuck.<br/>

by <i>davidzincavage</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1387619114">Just to clarify: in the US, bans against assault weapons typically have targeted ugly, military style long arms which do not actually meet the real definition of an assault weapon.  An assault weapon [translation of the German: sturmgewehr] is really, definitionally speaking, a long arm, firing a cartridge intermediate in power between conventional pistol and rifle cartridges, capable of both full and semi-automatic fire.  Arms included in US "assault weapon" bans usually, but not necessarily, resemble the exterior of assault weapons, but, since fully automatic weapons have been federally restricted since the 1930s, are merely semi-automatics.  Some shotguns, guilty of military appearance, have been included in such bans.  <br/>
<br/>
I don't know positively, but I think the NRA has filed amicus briefs on some knife cases.  Were litigation on Nihonto underway, I think it would be highly likely that the NRA, and other gun rights organizations, would be willing to assist.<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I think the case of Australia illustrates very clearly what will happen to weapons collectors who are sufficiently in the minority, and who fail to organize in time.  Bans of private weapons are feel-good symbolic measures giving politicians the opportunity to be seen taking action.  In the modern world, a serious and potent animosity toward private ownership of weapons exists on the part of a substantial and highly influential portion of the urban population.  This animosity is linked to the spirit of reformist ameliorism, the very popular belief that a specific solution by governmental diktat exists to any identifiable problem or ill.  Its roots lie in centuries old ideologies of religious utopianism, which literally desire all the swords to be beaten into plowshares.  And this philosophy is very popular on the political left, which yearns to increase the powers of the state, particularly the state's monopoly of force.  The affluent and educated sectors of American society typically live in congested urban environments.  They do not hunt or target-shoot.  They are estranged from the tradition of military service and the use of arms.  And they look with contempt on less educated, rural sectors of American society in which hunting, ownership of arms, and military service are highly valued traditions.  The wealthy bourgeois living in a million dollar house in Palo Alto thinks it is simply criminally irresponsible to allow a bunch of rubes and other denizens of American society's lower orders to play with dangerous weapons.  Who knows? one of these losers might even shoot him.    <br/>

able to provide you with information wise. It will be helpful to<br/>
everyone to know what the extent (and if they really have) of their help<br/>
is.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It looks to me like they are going to decide that criminals can't own<br/>
them. I don't think that is as bad as what we had thought, but maybe I<br/>
misread what their intention was.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>In the opinion of an NRA member.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Actually, they prefer of thinking of it as keeping deadly weapons out of<br/>
the hands of the stupid, and the brutal.<br/>
<br/>
And there are those in the center, who adopt some conservative and some<br/>
liberal views, who also do not like the thoughts of military style<br/>
firearms on the streets. I am more than happy to oblige the hunter, the<br/>
marksman, and the collector their rifles and hunting weapons of all<br/>
sorts.<br/>
<br/>
It falls in my realm of common sense though that flooding the streets<br/>
with military ordinance will not put the public at risk of them. <br/>
<br/>
This logic pervails in the US government and people, who no doubt<br/>
applauded the arrest of the arms dealer who was selling a shoulder<br/>
mounted missile into the USA (a fake, but he thought it real). <br/>
<br/>
Therein lies the logic, and everyone embraced it. You don't need a<br/>
Russian made plane-downer. The logic is fully embraced by almost all, I<br/>
think only a true blue died in the wool something or other can convince<br/>
himself that every house needs a shoulder mounted missile.<br/>
<br/>
Attempts to attack the logic then are not really that valid. The issue<br/>
is more one of "where do you draw the line." We are all talking similar<br/>
stories. <br/>
<br/>
Even the extremist who wants a heat seeking missile might consider that<br/>
public ownership of nuclear weapons is not a good thing (it would,<br/>
however, protect one nicely from the tyrrany of the government). <br/>
<br/>
So with that said, my own line is pretty good and in tune with where<br/>
Canada put it. The USA has the line shortly to the north, but there is a<br/>
lot of talk about how if that line gives one iota then the country will<br/>
fall to pieces. Maybe it will, but I don't see examples around me in the<br/>
real world that reflect that.<br/>
<br/>
I'll say it again, if the people around me lose their assault weapons, I<br/>
don't think I'll lose my swords (it has already happened here, I think<br/>
since before I was born). <br/>
<br/>
The logic is sound, it's really about where the line is.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think you set a record there for sweeping generalizations. Sounds like<br/>
the *real* thing to do would be to just kill all the rich city folk and<br/>
the country would be in a state of bliss and harmony ;-).<br/>
<br/>
I think that with nothing concrete at all here that has anything to do<br/>
with swords, the NRA stuff should get an off topic / political treatment<br/>
until someone can cite a live example. So that's all from me on this, my<br/>
points have been stated.<br/>
<br/>
I do want to believe that the NRA would help sword owners, but there is<br/>
nothing here that has been presented which is not just simple and many<br/>
times repeated gun-owner rhetoric, complete with the sweeping<br/>
generalizations, simplification of issues, and demonization of those<br/>
that don't agree with the political opinion.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>There's so much I could comment on, but I'm trying to limit my time <br/>
on line per my better half's desire.  So let me just say that the <br/>
Second Amendment isn't about duck or deer hunting, it's about killing <br/>
people with firearms, particulary people within the government, <br/>
should such government turn on the people it is supposed to <br/>
represent.  As such, the protection for a handgun (a defensive, last <br/>
ditch weapon in a major armed conflict) is somewhat weak, but a fully <br/>
automatic long arm is just what the Founding Fathers had in mind, <br/>
given modern technological advancements.  This doesn't mean that <br/>
private citizens should be permitted WMDs, but a full "rock 'n' roll" <br/>
rifle should be every citizen's right.  Unfortunately, besides <br/>
killing renegade politicians, it is pretty lethal in the hands of <br/>
psychopaths.  And in order to preclude this, liberals believe it is <br/>
correct to forego the Second Amendment, and give up the right to <br/>
resist an oppressive government, thinking that the kind, just and <br/>
benevolent government elected by the people could never turn <br/>
virulent.  This, of course, ignores world history and basic human <br/>
nature.  Anywho, Australia is indeed the road map for the rest of the <br/>
liberal left world.  The "safety line" you speak of is never far <br/>
enough along for those who desire complete safety (and in the <br/>
successful pursuit of this, finally lose the safety of the whole <br/>
society).  In an armed society, government exercises control at the <br/>
will of the people.  In an unarmed society, people exercise freedom <br/>
at the will of the government.  Not oversimplified, just is.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-852390901">BTW, in case you don't believe the government can turn on its <br/>
citizens, click on the link below.  In the depths of the Great <br/>
Depression, the price of gold started to rise despite the <br/>
deflationary times.  A number of people sought the precious metal as <br/>
a solid store of value.  In 1933, FDR outlawed the private ownership <br/>
of gold (which was called "hoarding" in the executive order - spin is <br/>
no recent phenonemon!), and, after all the gold was sucked up by the <br/>
government for paper dollars, FDR devalued those dollars by re-<br/>
pegging the price of gold from $20.67 to $35 an ounce!  Here's the <br/>
Presidential order:<br/>

<br/>
BTW, the order is still on the books, just temporarily rescinded, and <br/>
can be re-implemented at any time.  So if you believe that the Fed <br/>
has pumped too much money into the economy and roaring inflation is <br/>
around the corner, and have bought gold to hedge this, be aware that <br/>
the gubbermint is ready, willing and able to yank your life preserver <br/>
away.  Too bad, so sad, glub-glub-glub!<br/>
