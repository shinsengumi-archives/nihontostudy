<div id="ygrps-yiv-636054881">Dear group,<br/>
<br/>
First let me say it is a priviledge to have access to all of your <br/>
opinions. I can only hope that thru years of study that I may obtain <br/>
some of the knowledge this group possesses.<br/>
<br/>
Now my question..........If you would go to 'elliotts photos' and look <br/>
at numbers 19 and 20 (click on them), I am trying to determine the <br/>
school and time (early, middle, late Edo) of this Tsuba. I have taken <br/>
a shot at the characteristics of this piece. Just point me in a <br/>
direction to study.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you all,<br/>

The good:<br/>
There are some nice tsuba in your in your folder. I<br/>
like the Sukeyoshi and the one labeled Saotome.<br/>
<br/>
The bad:<br/>
Photos #19 & #20 are of a shiiremono (mass produced)<br/>
tsuba. It might even be one of the better modern<br/>
chinese repros. For study's sake, look up Mito<br/>
Shiiremono.<br/>
<br/>
The ugly:<br/>
There is no sharpness or crispness to the design. The<br/>
nanako (little beads) are crudely spaced. The figures<br/>
are poorly cut, and gold washed.<br/>

Thank you! And it only hurts a little.<br/>
<br/>
I bought this tsuba and another from one of the many 'dealers' who <br/>
spout their so-called knowledge of Nihonto but don't know their ass <br/>
from a hole-in-the-ground (and who will remain nameless). I learned <br/>
a very good lesson..........Be very careful about what you are being <br/>
sold and how much money your spending. Since they didn't cost me <br/>
alot, this lesson was worth the money. <br/>
<br/>
As soon as I take some pictures of the other, I will submit them for <br/>
a consult.<br/>
<br/>
The Saotome piece I have in my album is fabulous. I should hope to <br/>
never sell it. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

Does not look like Mito school to me.<br/>

Since no " big money " changed hands.......... it's one of those " <br/>

imagination runs wild.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I have one " soft metal " dragon in the cloud tsuba with fine nanako, <br/>
very high relief carving of the dragon . From the pics it looks good <br/>
( after two glasses of Yellow Tail ) but in hand it just gives out " <br/>

No matter how hard we may try, I think all of us make<br/>
an ass of ourselves at one time or another. I<br/>
certainly have. By sticking my neck out and giving an<br/>
opinion here, I've probably just ticked off a dealer<br/>
who now is going to send evil thoughts my way.<br/>
<br/>
There are a lot of dealers out there who are very<br/>
honest and take small profit for their pains. Do them<br/>
credit.<br/>
   Lordy knows it pains me to go through the process<br/>
of selling anything. Absolutely hate to even try! This<br/>
past year I picked up 2 lots of exceptionally good<br/>
tsuba and am only going to keep about 40% of them. I'm<br/>
in the process of papering them (slow process)and<br/>
deciding which to keep. I planned to let an auction<br/>
house sell them, but learned the auction houses get<br/>
their pound of flesh! Unless I give them over $100,000<br/>
of items... they take a greater % than any dealer I<br/>
know.<br/>
    As the tsuba come back from Japan, I'll just put<br/>
them out at Tampa sword show and possibly Chicago--<br/>
but ultimately a few of them will probably end up with<br/>
a dealer.<br/>
<br/>
So go easy on the dealers. Many are good people who<br/>
provide a service to buyers and sellers. There are 2<br/>
or 3 I call friend.<br/>

I didn't know if Torigoye had much on the<br/>
Nagoya/Yokohama shiiremono, so I just mentioned the<br/>
Mito shiiremono. Does the Nihonto Koza Kodogu volume<br/>
have much on the Nagoya shiiremono.<br/>
   As far as I'm concerned, same difference. But<br/>
concerning Elliott's tsuba- Nagoya/Yokohama is<br/>
probably more correct.<br/>

I apologize, I sometimes 'leap before looking'! There are very few <br/>
dealers that one must be careful of. Asking a lot of questions, <br/>
getting a lot of opinions is critical for my survival along with the <br/>
other 'newbees'. But, the dealer that sold me this piece (19 & 20 <br/>
photos)was not honest with me. I ask the right questions and got <br/>
incorrect answers. As I said, "I have learned from this experiance." <br/>
<br/>
The Saotome has a Shakudo rim.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you very much,<br/>

<br/>
Elliott, I know how you feel and can sympathize with your frustration.  Unfortunately it is a part of the learning curve associated with this hobby.<br/>
<br/>
As far as the dealers go, many of the people who have tables at shows are not dealers.  They are collectors who are upgrading their collections, just like you, in San Fran by selling pieces that have nothing left to teach them and buying new ones that they hope to learn from.  The majority of these people have the same limited knowledge selling their items as you did buying it.<br/>
<br/>
I doubt if they had any intent to mislead you, they just did not know any better.  Unfortunately this is true in most instances.  The seller has very little idea as to what he or she is selling.  This in my experience this applies equally to blades that are gime, and fittings that are less than what they may be demonstrated as.<br/>
<br/>
The dealers who make their living buying and selling swords and fittings know exactly what they are selling, and if they should make a mistake, they will look after you.<br/>
<br/>
Its all part of the learning curve.<br/>

  Curran,<br/>
<br/>
  I apologize, I sometimes 'leap before looking'! There are very few <br/>
  dealers that one must be careful of. Asking a lot of questions, <br/>
  getting a lot of opinions is critical for my survival along with the <br/>
  other 'newbees'. But, the dealer that sold me this piece (19 & 20 <br/>
  photos)was not honest with me. I ask the right questions and got <br/>
  incorrect answers. As I said, "I have learned from this experiance." <br/>
<br/>
  The Saotome has a Shakudo rim.<br/>
<br/>
  Thank you very much,<br/>
<br/>
  Elliott<br/>
<br/>
  PS; I admit making an ass out of myself sometimes.....I hate when <br/>
  that happens. <br/>
