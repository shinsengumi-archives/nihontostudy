that helps.<br/>

Rich - <br/>

Interesting to see this tsuba. My Akasaka of this design signed<br/>
Tadashige (to my relief) passed shinsa in Chicago. Of course I have it<br/>
here in front of me now to compare the work with your tsuba. While the<br/>
design is the same, the work on mine is more delicate (?)--more<br/>
piercing--and seems to "flow" more, if you know what I mean. The<br/>
horse's hoofs on your tsuba are more "squared" and "bold" than the more<br/>
naturally shaped hoofs on my tsuba. I just saw a similar tsuba<br/>
(picture) just the other day that showed these rather boldly made hoofs<br/>
and it was called something other than Akasaka, but for the life of me<br/>
I don't recall where I saw this. Thought it was in the new Mosle'<br/>
catalogue, but if so, I'm not finding it now. My tsuba came out of a<br/>
large collection of tsuba sold in Santiago, Chile in 2003. That<br/>
collection also had another similar "horse" tsuba that had these large<br/>
hoofs like your new tsuba, but I didn't buy that one. Most of these<br/>
730-plus tsuba were bought up by Michael Zomber, so perhaps your's<br/>
could be the one I saw. I'll check my records. <br/>

  All, I had a tsuba arrive today, it is a lot better in hand than the <br/>
  original images I purchased it from showed. There are fine running<br/>
bones <br/>
  all the way around the mimi, I am thinking Akasaka. Here are some<br/>
pics. <br/>
  Obviously modeled after Tadashige though there are a few Ito/Bushû <br/>
  versions around as well.<br/>
<br/>
  Dimensions are 70mm x 68mm x 3mm<br/>
<br/>
  cheers all<br/>
