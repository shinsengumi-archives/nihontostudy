<br/>
Gentlemen,<br/>
	I have heard from seven of you who wanted the Haynes <br/>
Catalogs. I can get them for $125 plus shipping. You will get issues <br/>
2,3,4,6,7,8 and 9 in new mint condition. Shipping will depend on <br/>
where you are located and how fast you want to receive them. Alan is <br/>
putting together the sets for me and I will pick them up in a week or <br/>
so.<br/>
	You know who you are please reconfirm for me if you still <br/>
want the books at this price. Anyone interested please let me know <br/>
now and we'll put together more sets. For the sake of everyones <br/>
bandwidth do not reply to this email but contact me off list.<br/>
<br/>
