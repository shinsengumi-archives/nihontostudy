<div id="ygrps-yiv-2004097560">Hi All, Could someone assist me in translating the inscription on a <br/>
kogatana I have. It comes out of a quality kozuka and has signs of <br/>
quality itself. It has an hamon, hardened edge and yasurime. As well <br/>
it has a mark like an arsenal mark though I don't study in that <br/>
period. Thanks, John     picture at : Johns stuff  title : Kogatana</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-121771794">Hi John. I have a partial reading ( I posted on NMB ) .<br/>
<br/>
With the hollyhock mon and starting with Nagasone Minamoto and ending <br/>
with Okimasa and Kao (?????) , it could be very good if genuine. I am <br/>
not sure on the rest of the mei. I will look through my references to <br/>
see if I have a Kao for him. I have been studying the Nagosone line a <br/>
lot recently and I may have a Wakizashi by either Okihisa or Okinao and <br/>
am looking closely at that line.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-511125013">Reading more into this John and Barry, I believe it is Nagasone Kotetsu <br/>
Nidaimei Okimasa. He is recorded as signing this way in Nihonto Koza but <br/>
there are no oshigata for that mei. Maybe someone else has one. I will <br/>
keep looking.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I have one that is extremely similar.  Would love to compare notes on <br/>
it (eg- how is yours tempered?) and would especially love to know if <br/>
somehow knows how to verify if it is real?  I was told that the <br/>
kotetsu taikan has pics of some kogatana in it.  <br/>
Thanks<br/>
