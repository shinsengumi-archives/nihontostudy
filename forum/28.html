It sounds plausible.  I'm not a sword user and I'm not sure who here is or<br/>
isn't, but I wonder how much influence the weight of a tsuba right next to<br/>
the hand has on the feel or balance of the sword.  Does anyone have<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > Hi Matt et all,  Ithink that is exactly what I was saying. Thinner lighter<br/>
 </span></blockquote>tsuba were used for one handed sword action as the use of the sword was<br/>
generally mounted ( from the horse ), later on in the The Muromachi, the<br/>
action moved two the ground and became two handed ( both hands were free )<br/>
the sword didn't need to be as light and the tsuba became heavier to cope<br/>
with the balance required for two handed use.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1284112519">Jim and all,<br/>
<br/>
The fact that a tsuba is larger or smaller may play some small role in the use of a sword,  but not in cutting. I really can not imagine samurai sitting around discussing the weight of a tsuba and how it affects cutting, unless it is as heavy as a brick.  A tsuba offers some protection for your hand.  The only exception that I know about is that a very long sword is extremely difficult to draw if you have a large tsuba.  The tsuba  makes too much contact with your wrist.  So a small tsuba is best.  Now, what I have seen is a handle that has metal inlayed at the end of the tsuka past the nakago.  I have a shin shinto katana that is 32" long.  It sounds very awkward to use but actually it is made in a interesting way.  The blade is slender and has fumbari and a strong curvature, also the stuba is leather with black lacquer over it and the tsuka has some kind of steel inlayed it at the end.  It is very noticeable.  The fact that the tsuba has almost no weight and the tsuka has extra weight added in the at the end of it makes this blade very nice to cut with.  At 32" long it actually feel light.  I hope to write an article on this sword with pictures in the future when I have more time.<br/>

It didn't seem intuitively obvious to me that tsuba weight could be that big of a factor vs. the weight distribution of the sword.  But, I know nothing about using swords.<br/>
<br/>
In the mid to late Edo period we see a fair number of really thick, heavy tsuba by the Myochin and others.  Is that something that could help in test cutting?  Or just for show...<br/>

	In my mind Edo period tameshi giri was a very ritualized <br/>
activity. A whole series of fees had to be paid, divination done, the <br/>
officials involved had to agree on a schedule, lunch had to be <br/>
ordered and an agenda that wouldn't allow for any embarrassment set <br/>
up. It wasn't like a carwash, where you drop off your sword and come <br/>
back later. It had to be done in just such a way. My understanding <br/>
has always been that the testers used special "testing tsuka" and no <br/>
tsuba, and probably made a big show of putting it on. I am inclined <br/>
to see thick tsuba as fashion and personal taste and not practical <br/>
(though surely they were sturdier than say kyosukashi pieces).<br/>
	I am curious about your thoughts on the use of and changes in <br/>
the tsuba. Early kenukigata tachi and ito maki tachi have thick soft <br/>
metal or kawa tsuba, many of these are seen in the catalogs. What <br/>
mounts do we see the big perfectly circular Kokatchushi and Kotosho <br/>
tsuba on? In your minds eye what king of mount do you see these on?I <br/>
could see these large rather thin plates being useful say on <br/>
horseback, when blade to blade combat would have occurred less often. <br/>
But as Richard says once we move from tachi to katana, don't the <br/>
tsuba have smaller diameters and become a bit thicker? what is the <br/>
progression as you see it?<br/>
	Kyo-sukashi ostensibly was the rage in the capitol, where <br/>
artistic merit surely held sway, these pieces made for the elite may <br/>
have seen battle but were seen as worthy of preservation early on. I <br/>
am thinking the workingmans' sword guard would be more along the <br/>
lines of a Hoan, very simple iron and were used up or even tossed out <br/>
in favor of the latest fad.<br/>

<h3>Re: [nihontostudy] tsuba balance</h3>
by <i>retalt</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1125426284">Tom, Jim et all. re the size of the older tsuba, I am looking through the book, The Picture Book of Old Tsuba by Robert Buroway and in the earlier section, there are several Katchushi pieces, the classic Iron Ko-Sukashi tsuba that can be seen in many books. These, at first glance look very large, just by their own dimensions. There is a Sukashi Katchushi Tsuba with the famous chrysanthemum design that is from the Nambokucho period. The size of the Nakago Ana and the hitsu and kozuka ana give the impression that the tsube would be roughly 4 " or something like that across, it looks huge. ( the pic is on page 9 if anyone has it )This leeds me to more questions. <br/>
<br/>
Were Nakago that much smaller ( width and depth not length ) in the earlier periods than say the late Koto, early Shinto eras ?, giving the impression of bigger tsuba, or were the tsuba just bigger in some cases ?. <br/>
<br/>
In most thing's we find, bigger is better, that is our way as collectors. All things being equal,  bigger swords are generally worth more than smallers ones. The same seems to apply to tsuba. Would that same mentality applied to the owners of these swords when they first had them made ?. Bigger looks better, show's greater wealth, looks more menacing ?<br/>
<br/>
During the waring periods when swinging a sword in battle was maybe a daily excersise, would a larger Tsuba have offered more protection, than a smaller tsuba ? or was it maybe a phycological advantage that the wielder had.<br/>

Don't think that a heavy tsuba will help in cutting test but a thin wide heavy sword will cut well generally.  Mino sword cut well, and a lot has to do with the fact that most are thin and wide with little niku in the ji.  But I don't believe that they will hold up well striking armor like the earlier koto blades of bizen, yamato and yamashiro. <br/>

  It didn't seem intuitively obvious to me that tsuba weight could be that big of a factor vs. the weight distribution of the sword.  But, I know nothing about using swords.<br/>

  In the mid to late Edo period we see a fair number of really thick, heavy tsuba by the Myochin and others.  Is that something that could help in test cutting?  Or just for show...<br/>

Yes, again there seems to be a great difference between the ideal sword for<br/>
armored battle hacking and that for shirt sleeve high noon showdown.  Still<br/>
haven't gotten photos yet of my flat polished Chen katana (I know you can't<br/>
wait!  ;o).  It should be good for the typical grass mat and green bamboo<br/>
cutting, but it looks way too delicate for smacking anything hard.  Like the<br/>

I have a late koto uchigatana (1 hand sword) that has<br/>
a small nakago.  It looks like a small tachi blade<br/>
which I was told wasn't uncommon at the time?  <br/>
<br/>
While I am certainly not an expert on the subject<br/>
seeing armour of the samurai and head gear etc, I<br/>
would assume these were meant at least in partial to<br/>
intimidate an opponent.  I think a larger tsuba would<br/>
fit into that concept.  Transmitting a message to the<br/>
opponent that he is taking on a man of importance?  My<br/>
gaigin guess.<br/>
<br/>
I asked this before, but what about the kogai/kozuka<br/>
ana being filled in? what purpose did this serve?  You<br/>
had a katana now its a wak size tsuba?  Purely<br/>
aesthetic?  Just to make sure you didn't stick you<br/>
kogai/kozuka in the wrong hole?<br/>

	I feel if the sword AND tsuba are of exaggerated proportions <br/>
then you might be intimidating. A large tsuba could look very awkward <br/>
on a short katana. Ana were usually filled later to "restore" older <br/>
tsuba to their original whole. I am sure there were later works made <br/>
with hitsu-ana that were then filled with gold say to add an <br/>

If you look at the uchigatana koshirae book, you will see at least one, but<br/>
maybe more of the Tensho mounts with what looks like Ko-tosho and<br/>
Ko-kattchushi tsuba on them. Sasano wrote a book that has reproductions from<br/>
Kamakura and later period e-maki-mono in which unmounted bushi wearing<br/>

        In my mind Edo period tameshi giri was a very ritualized<br/>
  activity. A whole series of fees had to be paid, divination done, the<br/>
  officials involved had to agree on a schedule, lunch had to be<br/>
  ordered and an agenda that wouldn't allow for any embarrassment set<br/>
  up. It wasn't like a carwash, where you drop off your sword and come<br/>
  back later. It had to be done in just such a way. My understanding<br/>
  has always been that the testers used special "testing tsuka" and no<br/>
  tsuba, and probably made a big show of putting it on. I am inclined<br/>
  to see thick tsuba as fashion and personal taste and not practical<br/>
  (though surely they were sturdier than say kyosukashi pieces).<br/>
        I am curious about your thoughts on the use of and changes in<br/>
  the tsuba. Early kenukigata tachi and ito maki tachi have thick soft<br/>
  metal or kawa tsuba, many of these are seen in the catalogs. What<br/>
  mounts do we see the big perfectly circular Kokatchushi and Kotosho<br/>
  tsuba on? In your minds eye what king of mount do you see these on?I<br/>
  could see these large rather thin plates being useful say on<br/>
  horseback, when blade to blade combat would have occurred less often.<br/>
  But as Richard says once we move from tachi to katana, don't the<br/>
  tsuba have smaller diameters and become a bit thicker? what is the<br/>
  progression as you see it?<br/>
        Kyo-sukashi ostensibly was the rage in the capitol, where<br/>
  artistic merit surely held sway, these pieces made for the elite may<br/>
  have seen battle but were seen as worthy of preservation early on. I<br/>
  am thinking the workingmans' sword guard would be more along the<br/>
  lines of a Hoan, very simple iron and were used up or even tossed out<br/>
  in favor of the latest fad.<br/>

Thanks for the reply on tameshi giri.  I have an old friend staying with me and haven't had much time to devote to the list.<br/>
<br/>
The only koshirae mounted with Ko Katchushi or Ko Tosho tsuba that I have seen in person or in illustrations were typical mid to late Muromachi katana or wakizashi.  I have not seen an early tachi mounted with these guards.<br/>
<br/>
Most of the early tachi koshirae that have been preserved seem to have been for formal wear and these are fitted with relatively elaborate soft metal guards.  There are many practical tachi preserved at Oyamazumi, and some others in existence elsewhere, and they are mounted with nerikawa tsuba.  It seems that early tosho and katchushi guards were intended for practical use, but it is not clear to me that they were ever mounted on tachi despite some references claiming this.  I'll try to get back to the possible use of some of these tsuba on naginata or nagimaki, but I don't think that the majority were mounted on pole arms.<br/>
<br/>
Reading ahead through the email list, Gordon is of course correct about Sasano's interpretation of the picture scrolls and his construction of a chronological sequence from extant iron guards.  I don't think that any of these very early katana or koshirae still exist.  I have to wonder why the tsuba still exist and why so many of the supposed early examples have wakizashi-style kozuka ana that are considered to have been added later.<br/>

It's late and I'm out of steam again...  more to follow when time permits.<br/>

	I think Richard posed the original question. Since I have an <br/>

practicality. I am far from expert in such matters but never short of <br/>
opinion. I seem to have most of it worked out in my head but those <br/>

<h3>Ko katchushi and ko tosho on tachi</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-779969664">Hi. <br/>
 When one considers the design orientation of some of those tsuba it would<br/>
seems that must have been carried on tachi. On the issue of the lack of<br/>
confirmatory evidence, I used to point out to students, when the lecture<br/>
got to methodology, that the absence of evidence is not the same thing as<br/>
the evidence of absence. Further there are many katchushi and tosho that<br/>
would seem from the design orientation to be intended to be carried with<br/>
katana koshirae, and undoubtedly most were carried that way, however some<br/>
of them, perhaps the largest ones, were probably used on no-dachi for<br/>
which a katana orientation would probably make sense if they were used for<br/>
over the shoulder carry most of the time.<br/>

Tom,<br/>
Thanks for the reply on tameshi giri.  I have an old friend staying with me<br/>
and haven't had much time to devote to the list.<br/>
<br/>
The only koshirae mounted with Ko Katchushi or Ko Tosho tsuba that I have<br/>
seen in person or in illustrations were typical mid to late Muromachi katana<br/>
or wakizashi.  I have not seen an early tachi mounted with these guards.<br/>
<br/>
Most of the early tachi koshirae that have been preserved seem to have been<br/>
for formal wear and these are fitted with relatively elaborate soft metal<br/>
guards.  There are many practical tachi preserved at Oyamazumi, and some<br/>
others in existence elsewhere, and they are mounted with nerikawa tsuba.  It<br/>
seems that early tosho and katchushi guards were intended for practical use,<br/>
but it is not clear to me that they were ever mounted on tachi despite some<br/>
references claiming this.  I'll try to get back to the possible use of some<br/>
of these tsuba on naginata or nagimaki, but I don't think that the majority<br/>
were mounted on pole arms.<br/>
<br/>
Reading ahead through the email list, Gordon is of course correct about<br/>
Sasano's interpretation of the picture scrolls and his construction of a<br/>
chronological sequence from extant iron guards.  I don't think that any of<br/>
these very early katana or koshirae still exist.  I have to wonder why the<br/>
tsuba still exist and why so many of the supposed early examples have<br/>
wakizashi-style kozuka ana that are considered to have been added later.<br/>

It's late and I'm out of steam again...  more to follow when time permits.<br/>

        I am curious about your thoughts on the use of and changes in <br/>
  the tsuba. Early kenukigata tachi and ito maki tachi have thick soft <br/>
  metal or kawa tsuba, many of these are seen in the catalogs. What <br/>
  mounts do we see the big perfectly circular Kokatchushi and Kotosho <br/>

  could see these large rather thin plates being useful say on <br/>
  horseback, when blade to blade combat would have occurred less often. <br/>
  But as Richard says once we move from tachi to katana, don't the <br/>

<h3>Re: [nihontostudy] Ko katchushi and ko tosho on tachi</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-530116439">Hi Arnold,<br/>
<br/>
However, absence of evidence is still absence of proof, and of course speculation is not evidence.<br/>
<br/>
The Nambokucho nodachi that I have seen were mounted with moderately sized nerikawa tsuba.  I have not seen one mounted with any sort of iron tsuba.  [Why were the leather-mounted swords perserved and the iron-mounted ones lost?]<br/>
<br/>
Most of the so-called "tachi design orientation" katchushi and tosho guards that I have seen have been speculative at best and incorrectly interpreted at worst.  I'd like to discuss any specific examples anyone can cite.<br/>
<br/>
Jim<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  Hi. <br/>
  When one considers the design orientation of some of those tsuba it would<br/>
  seems that must have been carried on tachi. On the issue of the lack of<br/>
  confirmatory evidence, I used to point out to students, when the lecture<br/>
  got to methodology, that the absence of evidence is not the same thing as<br/>
  the evidence of absence. Further there are many katchushi and tosho that<br/>
  would seem from the design orientation to be intended to be carried with<br/>
  katana koshirae, and undoubtedly most were carried that way, however some<br/>
  of them, perhaps the largest ones, were probably used on no-dachi for<br/>
  which a katana orientation would probably make sense if they were used for<br/>
  over the shoulder carry most of the time.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1688806606">I happened to visit the Metropolitan Museum of Art today to see their new show "Great Waves, Chinese Themes in the Art of Korea and Japan."  While not a particularly successful show, there are some very good paintings, including an interesting set of newly acquired handscrolls from the Nanbokucho period on display that included some apparently accurate battle sequences.  <br/>
<br/>
Titled "Aki no yonagawa monogatari emaki" (Illustrated tale for a long autumn night), there are clear depictions of wakizashi-sized swords being worn edge-upward under the sash.  These are worn by unarmored and otherwise unarmed monks, lightly armored footsoldiers also armed with naginata, and even by a few elaborately armored mounted and unmounted warriors sporting tachi and bow or naginata.<br/>
<br/>
These "uchigatana" have no no tsuba.  The tachi appear to be mounted with typical mokko-gata nerikawa tsuba of the period.  The lower status individuals carry naginata without tsuba and the higher carry naginata with rather small guards.  There are no "O-dachi" depicted.<br/>
<br/>
The drawing of the arms and armor appears to be accurate enough to be worth study.  It is of course only one data point, but it is one that I haven't seen exhibited before.<br/>

Darn it, you guys that live in New York have all the fun :-)<br/>
<br/>
Did they publish a show catalog that happens to have pics of this piece <br/>
in it? (this would be a good spot to use that G3<br/>
 :-) ).  This is interesting - I wonder if there are so few pieces <br/>
because they got "used up" (like most of the early yari/naginata),<br/>
remade into something else, or were simply not "worthy of preservation". <br/>
 They did appear longer than sun nobi tanto, right?<br/>
<br/>
I've always wondered if the footsoldier types would  normally carry a <br/>
full length sword in additon to a polearm - seems<br/>
like it would kind of get in the way...<br/>
<br/>
And speaking of polearms, have you seen many "original" polearm koshirae <br/>
from this period?  I was kind of wondering about<br/>
the presence, size, etc, or tsuba and/or "catchers" on the yari/naginata <br/>
of the period. (I think I've only seen a couple<br/>
(the ones that are in "all" the books - as usual, the few examples the <br/>
owners let anybody see)).<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

I put up a few fuzzy images in the group photo album.  I'm not sure anyone will be able to make anything out of them without having already seen the original.  Photography was, I'll just say "not encouraged."<br/>
<br/>
There isn't a catalog of the exhibition, but hopefully they will publish this scroll at some point.  The swords seem to be of the same sort as numbers 3-7 in the 1987 Uchigatana Koshirae exhibit catalog from the Tokyo National Museum.<br/>
<br/>
I have seen some period naginata koshirae without guards and others with moderate-sized ones.  Oyamazumi has quite a few very interesting early naginata and nagamaki, but I haven't seen the koshirae and don't know if they still exist.<br/>
