<h3>Tsuba carving terminology</h3>
by <i>sworddad</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-333840446">Hi all - <br/>
<br/>
What is the Japanese name (term) for sunken relief carved design on tsuba? I'm talking about the design being made by carving the plate surface away. The tsuba I'm looking at has been posted under photos...<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://tinyurl.com/2jq42a">http://tinyurl.com/2jq42a</a><br/>
<br/>
and shows a 24-petal kiku sukashi where the petals are rounded down below the surface of the rim and overall plate. (In this case, the tsuba is actually tapered, the flat edge being 1 mm less than the seppa-dai surface.) In the Boston book Ogawa called this sukidashi takabori  in the Hayne/Harvie study book it seems to be called horiage (if I'm understanding the description correction) and also another term which I can't find right now. <br/>
<br/>
Is there a common name for this type of sunken relief carving? <br/>

Tsuba 227 design is all made (carved) below its plate surface the same as 627 except this one is more elaborately done with the plum blossom branch design. <br/>

Also an interesting tsuba that has a Choshu design but the work is much more thin and delicate and looks more Kyoto-something to me...could it be Kyo-Shoami? Again...I'm looking for terminology here. <br/>

<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I think in the case of your two tsuba, niku-bori would be the correct term,<br/>
but, I could be wrong. Sukidashi-bori and sukidashi takabori are used when<br/>
there is carving that digs downward into the flat surface of the tsuba and<br/>
creates high relief carvings. Such carving typically does not include<br/>
sukashi work.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-106791304">Hi Ron:<br/>
<br/>
  In the case of solid tsuba, the term would be<br/>
"Sukidashi-bori", but I don't think I've ever seen it<br/>
applied to this particular type of tsuba, although I<br/>
suppose if you were writing a description for sale you<br/>
could say that the blossoms are carved in<br/>
sukidashi-bori.  <br/>
  The tsuba itself is pretty clearly Bushu-Ito work,<br/>
despite the slender Akasaka like lines. Typically,<br/>
I've seen these pieces coming from the Tokugawa<br/>
domains, either Edo (the mimi-zogan is characteristic<br/>
of the Edo Bushu Ito school) or Hitachi.  You've got a<br/>
slightly unusual design here because it looks like it<br/>
might have a bit of influence from the Higo Hayashi<br/>
school as well (I'm thinking of the shape and<br/>
positioning of the larger branches, but the carving is<br/>
definitely Bushu-Ito style as is the mimi-zogan. Not<br/>
really surprising to see these little cross-style<br/>
techniques creep in because of the Sankin-Kotai.  It's<br/>
obviously a high-class piece and my guess is that it<br/>
was probably custom made for one particular sword and<br/>
did not go the typical route of a gazillion remounts<br/>
like the more typical trade-goods tsuba.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>

  Gordon and I never seem to agree on anything, but<br/>
isn't takabori more properly used to refer to high<br/>
relief carving, even when the techique is primarily<br/>

<br/>
The two terms are often used together particularly with deeply carved Mino pieces <br/>
where the top of the cravings are at the surface level, but a great deal of metal has <br/>
been removed using the sukidashi technique that results in takabori. <br/>
