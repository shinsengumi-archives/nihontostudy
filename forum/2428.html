<h3>kokuin (stamped seals)</h3>
by <i>sworddad</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1623742023">Hi all - <br/>
<br/>
Somebody asked me about how "kokuin" were put onto nakago. I've always refered to these as "hot stamped" but really, I wonder how the smith applied these stamps. The nakago being soft (not hardened), were they punched in after the sword was finished? It would seem illogical to think the smith "heated the nakago" enough to "hot stamp" their seal. Can anyone explain how this was done? <br/>
<br/>
A related question is about Masahide who did apply a "kokuin" to his nakago. Does anyone know if Masahide ever signed his nakago with his "kokuin" only? (Not signing his full mei with it.) <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1068986728">Hi Ron, is response to the Masahide question, I assume it is Suishinshi <br/>
Masahide you are referring to, in Suishinshi Masahide to Sono Ichimon <br/>
there are many oshigata of Masahide blades with the kokuin, none of the <br/>
kokuin on it's own though. There is a small section also on his kokuin <br/>
and Kao ( do you have the book ? ) it is in Japanese but I can copy that <br/>
section for you if you like.<br/>
<br/>
Just for general interests sake, his Kao is made up up the disassembled <br/>
kanji 'Hide' which is re assembled in a different order, interesting.<br/>

Yes, the Gassan did this thing, too. The few times I've looked at these stamps they really didn't look like they were "cold stamped." They don't appear "sharply" cut nor do they appear "pushed out" around their edges (so to speak). But I can't understand how you could "hot stamp" a nakago. It would seem the nakago would have to be at a "red" temperature for hot stamping, and that would seem to need to be done before the hamon treatment is done. These stamps seem to be nicely done and in keeping with the rest of a "finished" nakago, not done way ahead of finishing the nakago. Honestly, I have no knowledge of how this is done, other than what has been passed on over the decades. It would be interesting to hear from somebody (swordsmith?) who has first-hand experience on this. Let's see what others can offer...<br/>

<h3>Re: [nihontostudy] kokuin (stamped seals)</h3>
by <i>Barry Thomas</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-670141746">Dear Blokes,<br/>
<br/>
Trickie, if the stamp was white hot it would simply be like a piece of<br/>
plasticine when hit with a 10 kilo hammer!!!  A friend of mine has a Naotane<br/>
wakizashi with a kokuin that reads in katakana "KOROMO", the town where<br/>
Naotane made the sword.  This stamp has been struck slightly off true.  I'm<br/>
not in metallurgy either, but I would speculate that when a hardened stamp<br/>
is placed against a tang resting on a very heavy anvil then struck very hard<br/>
with a 10 kilo hammer, that the softer tang metal truly flows like caramel<br/>
fudge - somewhat like the phenomenon of explosive plastic deformation.  I<br/>
remember reading of a swordsmith in Japan who (in an interview) said that<br/>
metal can be pushed around from place to place.  So all in all, considering<br/>
what little I do know of metallurgy I think it is done as I have outlined.<br/>
<br/>
The Gassan with the stamp is more likely to be by Sadakazu 1st than<br/>
Sadakatsu.  I have a monograph written by Benjamin Hazard of a Gassan I<br/>
tanto in the MMA that has a kokuin (from a failing memory...).<br/>

Not being involved in metallurgy at all, could not the stamp be white<br/>
