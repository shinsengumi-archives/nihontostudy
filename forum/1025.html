<h3>Akasaka Age</h3>
by <i>retalt</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-981994291">Hi all, I picked this Akasaka tsuba up some time ago. It was sold to me as Shôami I think from memory. I  personally believed it to be from around the 6th or 7th Gen Akasaka line, though unsure who in that line may have made it.<br/>
<br/>
A few months back I took it to a trip to Melbourne and showed it to some friends and our local Kodôgu expert there believed it was early Akasaka, maybe around the time of the 2 - 4th gen.<br/>
<br/>
It is Wak sized and about 4mm thick. Any thought's ?<br/>

For some reason I can't use your links - I get an error message saying the file is inaccessible.  (Same thing that happened before.)  <br/>
<br/>
Is this the tsuba labeled Akasaka-1 & 2 in your folder ("Sashimono in negative silhouette and clouds in positive silhouette")?  <br/>
<br/>
4 mm would be unusually thin for early Akasaka.  The late guards can be that thin.<br/>

A lot are even thicker.  Early Akasaka guards will usually have a very full, round maru mimi.  Owari guards tend to be rather squarish (but there are exceptions).  Some guards that otherwise resemble Owari get put into Ko-Shoami if the rim is more rounded.  But these have no where near the rounding of early Akasaka work.<br/>
<br/>
I'll get to something on Ezo and Ainu work in the next couple of days.<br/>

The lunar eclipse is underway here in the Eastern US.<br/>

I think. Seems more likely to me.<br/>
