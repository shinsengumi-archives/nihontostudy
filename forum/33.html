No ISBN number, but the name appears in English and Japanese on the front<br/>
cover of the book, but not on the spine.  It doesn't appear in English on<br/>
the thin board dust cover, but the name is in English on both the spine and<br/>
the front of the thicker two-piece outer cardboard box.  (I don't know the<br/>
proper terms for these boxes, I'm sure Craig would know.)  It shouldn't be<br/>
hard to spot.  I'd guess that you could get it at Isshindo:<br/>

<br/>
Since my name was mentioned, I'd better respond! For anyone that doesn't<br/>
know me - perhaps many of you since I'm usually pretty quiet on all the<br/>
lists I've been on since Robert Cole's first - I am a notorious<br/>
bibliomaniac, among other obsessions, mostly tsuba these days.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately I don't know any special terminology for these<br/>
boxes-within-boxes except "slipcover" and "shipping box." When I do get<br/>
books that have the shipping box part (still on used or on new books) I<br/>
archive them in the attic since they tend to look shoddy on my shelves. It's<br/>
a very Asian thing, although I have seen them on high-end European art<br/>
books. Is Alan Bale on board here yet? He's the real pro on books.<br/>
<br/>
For anyone who hasn't drifted off to sleep through this, what originally<br/>
came to my mind was "chitsu," which is the name of the very Japanese folding<br/>
book cover with little ivory (or plastic) tabs that slip into little pockets<br/>
on the spine. Love those.<br/>
<br/>
Of course I can't spot my copy of "Studies in Kyo Goto" at the moment, wish<br/>
they had put the English on the spine, too. But I did find my copy of "Tsuba<br/>
no Bi" that was discussed on the other list recently. In fact, I'm pretty<br/>
sure I have *two* copies of that.<br/>
<br/>
Bibliomania - a perplexing and tragic affliction.<br/>

PS - Thanks Jim for giving us a sane refuge.<br/>
