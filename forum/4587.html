<br/>
This scan is from the book 'Tsuba in Southern California', pg. 32 <br/>
bottom right.  This tsuba apparently belonged to Robert Haynes and I <br/>
believe it had the ume added when the box/hako gaki was done <br/>
(conjecture).  <br/>
I did some research into this tsuba mei and I believe it is Myochin <br/>
Ki Muneharu, Haynes 06041.0 in that the kanji for Haru matches that <br/>
of the mei most closely.  Unfortunately I do not have Katchushi <br/>
Meikan by Sasama,Y. so I cannot verify this attribution.  In <br/>
researching the mei I found these to be the closest:<br/>
Muneyoshi:  Haynes 06365.0 Kinko Meikan new: pg. 436<br/>
                                        old: pg. 535 - 536<br/>
                          Wakayama TKMT-III: pg. 270 - 271<br/>
Muneharu:   Haynes 06049.0 Kinko Meikan new: pg. 427<br/>
                                        old: pg. 525<br/>
Of note is the teganemei, although subtle, point to Muneyoshi.  <br/>
However, the mei simply does not match any of the examples found in <br/>
any of the above texts.<br/>
It would be of interest to see the mei from the Sasama book which <br/>
perhaps another member might have on hand.<br/>
