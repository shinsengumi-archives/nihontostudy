	Despite light sales activity no one I talked to was disappointed  <br/>
with this years show. The tables were all full, unlike laste year  <br/>
when storms back east prevented some from attending. There were  <br/>
several Japanese with tables set up that had not been here in the  <br/>
recent past, Most notably Aoi Arts. There were exceptional swords,  <br/>
and lots of average blades though maybe not as many swords overall  <br/>
compared to last year. two things of note were the number of Gassan  <br/>
works for sale, there were a half dozen polished and papered pieces  <br/>
scattered through out the show room and a real chance to study  <br/>
Sadakazu, Sadakatsu and others. Also there were many more koshirae of  <br/>
exceptional quality and interest and I enjoyed quite a bit of my time  <br/>
pouring over these.<br/>
	The NTHK presented the Swords and Fittings of Mino Province, the  <br/>
Naginata seen below is from that exhibit. The NBTHK did a  <br/>
presentation of Tanto, 13 total as I recall, from Awataguchi Hisakuni  <br/>
to Gassan Sadakazu. The Soshu Yukimitsu tanti which was number two on  <br/>
the table was my pick for best of show. There was a Soshu Hiromasa  <br/>
Otanto (kowakizashi) in the middle of the pack that was in an older  <br/>
polish which was a bit scuffed up but this did not prevent one from  <br/>
seeing the quality, a fine example of the period and not the kind of  <br/>
koto we usually see around here.<br/>
	There was an NBTHK Kantei-kai as well. With a Yosozaemon Suksada  <br/>
yoroidoshi and a Kawai Hisayuki katana being the stand-outs. The  <br/>
Kawai blade was presented by the First Japanese Ambassadors to the US  <br/>
to their American chaperone and it is still held in the same family.  <br/>
A real treasure.<br/>
	I bought some books as one might expect, sold very few that I  <br/>
brought with me but I learned lots and enjoyed good company all  <br/>
weekend. I am sure we'll here more from others as they get back to  <br/>
their homes from way out west...<br/>

<br/>
I kinda went into a Nihonto feeding frenzy and bought a sword, koshirae and <br/>
3 tsuba.  I should never have left the front check-in table......  But I <br/>
agree with your statement about enjoying good company the whole weekend.  I <br/>
enjoyed that most of all.<br/>
<br/>
I have a Kawai Hisayoshi in my lineage, but I'm wondering if Hisayuki is <br/>
there also...  I have a family scroll that shows my family history dating <br/>
back to around the beginning of the Heian Period which states that I am <br/>
descended from Taira Kiyomori.  I'm bringing it to club meeting because I <br/>
talked to Fred at the show and want some clarification about what it says.<br/>
<br/>
Has the club ever given out a questionaire/feedback form when someone <br/>
registers for a table?  Or maybe hand them out to people before the end of <br/>
the show to get feedback about the show and if we can improve on anything or <br/>
any gripes they may have (including accomdations)?  This information could <br/>
help us make the show even better.  Just thinking out loud...........<br/>

looking forward to seeing your new treasures. For other folks I  <br/>
posted some photos to my Nihonto@ foto folder since I had lots of  <br/>
room there. Not a lot of pics really but I didn't have time to take  <br/>
pictures while simultaneously picking up everything on all the tables...<br/>

<h3>Re: [nihontostudy] Kawai Hisayuki</h3>

	It would be interesting to find a connection. Kawai Hisayuki was a  <br/>
Tokugawa vassal who made swords for pleasure. His given name was  <br/>
Kametaro, his Go was Shoseishi, he had a son, Kawai Hisataka who  <br/>
succeeded to the name of Hisayuki. The Shodai Hisayuki died in Tokyo  <br/>
in Sept. 1868, his son died in Tokyo in 1886. I believe the temple  <br/>
they are buried in is called the Ryuyoji.<br/>
	Any of this fit your genealogy? would be cool if he was a long lost  <br/>
cousin...<br/>
