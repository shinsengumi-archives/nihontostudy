<h3>sword found</h3>
by <i>samurai@xhasc.com</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-724498540">Apologies for the bulk email (sent to the list and to some individuals)<br/>
as a lot of people were informed and I got a lot of nice supportive<br/>
emails from everyone who helped along the way.<br/>
<br/>
This Yukimitsu was finally delivered to me after five weeks. <br/>
<br/>
The final story as told to me by Canada Customs was that a postal<br/>
employee brought them the sword on January 24th (it was sent from Japan<br/>
on December 22nd by air), they then released it the same day.<br/>
<br/>
The final story as told to me by Canada Post was that one of their<br/>
employees searched at Canada Customs and found the sword there. <br/>
<br/>
Obviously not both can be true, so someone is covering their ass<br/>
somewhere. <br/>
<br/>
Canada Customs was always very good on this whole thing were the ones<br/>
who gave me detailed information about Canada Post that CP didn't even<br/>
know about itself... information that was required to let me get the<br/>
sword in the end, rather than what Canada Post wanted to do which was to<br/>
write it off as permanently lost. It allowed me to get a message sent to<br/>
the warehouse manager that started the search that immediately turned up<br/>
the sword.<br/>
<br/>
This identical problem happened to me one year ago in Montreal, with the<br/>
same situation... someone removed a sword from the stream, scanned that<br/>
it was sent to Customs, then it was put aside in someone's office where<br/>
at the end of three weeks of phone calls and searching it was later<br/>
"found" 15 minutes after I said I was sending the police.<br/>
<br/>
Needless to say it is Fedex only for me here on in, and I could myself<br/>
lucky to have gotten both pieces back.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks go to a lot of you who sent me supportive notes. I was pretty<br/>
deep in despair there due to the value and importance of the<br/>
piece. Those notes helped me make it through, so thanks.<br/>

<br/>
I will get some pictures up to share shortly, it is a very impressive<br/>
sword. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-121968166">I lost a kodachi signed Bitchu Sadatsugu (nagamei) dated 1379 somewhere<br/>
around 30 years ago, so I know how you feel darcy.  The real worry is that<br/>
the people who do these things really have no idea just how precious and<br/>
fragile they really are.  Still, I wouldn't collect anything else despite<br/>
the potential nightmares...<br/>
