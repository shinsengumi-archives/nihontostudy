<h3>Question for tsuba experts</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1086948076">I have a tsuba which has a certain amount of what looks like black lacquer remaining on a minority of its surface.  Should I be boiling this tsuba, trying to remove whatever is left?  Or should I preserve it as is? <br/>

An almost identical tsuba (evidently without lacquer) is identified in Haynes catalogue 2 as "Ko Umetada style." <br/>

I would say yours is later than the ko-umetada. I<br/>
don't know how much later. I'm just basing my opinion<br/>
off the seppa dai and some of the other measurements.<br/>
Maybe yours is 50 to 100 years younger than the<br/>
ko-umetada photographed. My confidence level isn't<br/>
super high though, so don't quote me. Just sticking my<br/>
neck out to risk an opinion.<br/>
<br/>
As to the black lacquer- thats your call. If the<br/>
lacquer is fair to good quality, I personally would be<br/>
inclined to leave it. I'm of the minimally invasive<br/>
school of thought. Clean it to a preservation point of<br/>
view.<br/>
   If the lacquer is well done and has survived this<br/>
long, I consider it part of the atmosphere of the<br/>
piece. If its a hack job, boil away.<br/>

Not disagreeing with Curran at all, as I am a cautious<br/>
preservationist. "Do no harm" is my motto, and from the photos though<br/>
it looks like the lacquer doesn't add to the appeal, I would be<br/>
worrying what the patina will look like in those areas if you do<br/>
remove it. If it ends up blotchy, you would have to look at<br/>
repatinating the whole piece, leaving it hardly original.<br/>
<br/>
Of course the argument can be reasonably made that the lacquer (or<br/>
paint, Milt) - being a later add-on - makes it impossible to have the<br/>
"original" article without some restoration. While there are those who<br/>
believe that all tsuba as we have them today have been messed with and<br/>
should be taken down to bare metal and patinated "as originally<br/>
intended," they are in the minority, and I would question their claim<br/>
to certain knowledge of what was "originally intended" by the artisan.<br/>
<br/>
Wait a few weeks, David, you will get a number of more qualified<br/>
opinions in person at the San Francisco Token Kai.<br/>

 Almost all old iron, particularly tosho and katchushi, would have had<br/>
lacquer. It is a real plus to have even traces remaining. Sometimes soft<br/>
metal will also have lacquer traces. Do not remove. <br/>
