<h3>Nihontopedia</h3>

<br/>
I've been mulling over the idea of creating a wiki (open source, user <br/>
driven encyclopedia) on Nihonto for a few months now. The idea was <br/>
based on my seeing a need for a more comprehensive and <br/>
monitored/moderated source of Nihonto information on the world wide <br/>
web that would be easily accessible to anyone seeking or having <br/>
information on our favorite subject.<br/>
<br/>
Please browse to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.nihontopedia.org/">http://www.nihontopedia.org/</a> or <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.nihontopedia.com/">http://www.nihontopedia.com/</a> and take a look. You will need to create <br/>
a user id before it will let you publish anything. At this point in <br/>
time, I am the only sysop/admin. As you and the rest of the <br/>
enthusiasts post articles, this will surely overwhelm me, especially <br/>
since I am by no means an expert yet. Let me know if you're <br/>
interested in sharing the sysop role with me and I'll consider all <br/>
respondents on a case by case basis.<br/>
<br/>
I'm footing the bill for this, both from an administrative as well as <br/>
a server/bandwidth perspective, so please bear with me while I work <br/>
out some of the kinks, technically and operationally. Also, please <br/>
send me your thoughts, ideas, concerns and anything else related to <br/>
this little project of mine.<br/>
<br/>
The wiki is 100% empty now, I was going to write a few articles but <br/>
it's the end of the week and I only just now finished setting it up <br/>
to where I think it's stable. Which reminds me, any bugs you notice, <br/>
let me know.<br/>
<br/>
If you like the idea, and I know there are a lot of extremely <br/>
knowledgeable nihonto experts here, please start posting some <br/>
articles. Also, please send the url out to your contacts not on the <br/>
two lists I'm posting this to, Nihonto and NihontoStudy on Yahoo Groups.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for reading, and I hope you like it!<br/>
<br/>
Best Regards,<br/>
