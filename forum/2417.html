<br/>
For those who do not have a copy of the old 1979 Meibutsu catalogue--a super exhibit put on jointly by the JSS/US and (now defunct) Chicago TSG, I'm listing a batch of these on Ebay for awhile. Check out: #2288820817 and then go to "sellers other auctions" for additional copies. Lots of interesting oshigata/descriptions.<br/>
<br/>
Found a stack of these recently in my attic and decided to peddle them. Covers are slightly "aged" but not seriously. Good catalogue for cheap. (Put $27 Buy it now on them.) Nice book, especially for the newer collector. What a nice exhibit that one was!! <br/>
<br/>
Anybody want copies outside of Ebay, hollar privately, off-list: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:swords@...">swords@...</a> <br/>
