<h3>Unusual fuchi</h3>
by <i>sworddad</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1974006869">Hi all - <br/>
<br/>
Looked at a sword for a friend last evening which had something I've never seen before. The fuchi--all that remained of the tsuka fittings--was of plain shakudo with the motif of (I'm guessing) a "Noh character" and a "closed fan in a holder." Oddly, this decoration was "pinned" to the fuchi rather than soldered on. Never saw that before! Actually, it was a bit loose and seemed like a careless way of attaching this to the base metal, but it was quite old and done originally and not post-war by some GI. Anyone else ever seen this method used?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1540774874">Hi Ron,<br/>
I had a Ko-Kinko kogai (Tokubetsu Hozon) that had the decoration pinned in place.  It was well fitted and wouldn't be noticed if not for the end of the pin visible on the back.<br/>
<br/>
There are one or two old tsuba in Bob Haynes' auction catalogs that are described as having the decoration pinned in place.  <br/>
<br/>
I can't recall ever seeing it used on a fuchi but it would be easy to miss without close inspection.<br/>
