<h3>Looking for an article</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-94926792">All-<br/>
	Some years ago there was an article I believe in the JSSUS that  <br/>
dealt with the specifics of how a smith applied for and received his  <br/>
court titles. I am not talking about the Art and the Sword Vol 7.  <br/>
Rather this was a stand alone article that covered the costs, the  <br/>
people and the application process at least in the Edo period as I  <br/>
remember it.<br/>
	If anyone remembers who wrote it or which issue it may have come  <br/>
from I would greatly appreciate the point in a right direction.<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
