<div id="ygrps-yiv-2008540994">I have added scans of the other side of the tsuba to the folder below.  I forgot to mention the dimensions again, so for the record they are 90.1 mm H x 84.1 mm W x 5.0 - 5.5 mm thick at the mimi.<br/>
<br/>
The maker is Nobuie and the signature is of the type now called futoji-mei &#22826;&#23383;&#37528; (bold, thick).  Within both the hanare and futoji-mei types there is considerable variation in the detail of the signatures.  This example is not one of the more boldly executed futoji-mei.  As Pete crypictically indicated, an oshigata of this guard is published in Nakamura Kakudayu and Akiyama Kyusaku's 1926 Nobuie Tsuba shu (#52).  There the signature is described as sumari-mei &#35440;&#12426;&#37528; ("close packed"), which is one of the older terms now included within the futoji-mei type.  This guard is described as futoji-mei in several later books and in the NBTHK's attribution.<br/>
<br/>
The hitsuana had not yet been filled when the oshigata was made.  This guard was the property of the Okubo daimyo family in Odawara until it was sold in 1931, so the ana were likely filled by the new owner.  It is unlikely that they are original to the plate given that they are made such that the guard would be mounted with the unsigned side as the front.  The shapes of the hitsuana are unusual.   It was clearly mounted with an o-kozuka, which are typically 18-20 mm wide (vs. the standard size of 14-15 mm).  As Gordon mentioned, the small size of the kogai-ana suggests it was mounted with one of the narrow style ko-Mino kogai.  The opening is too small to accommodate a standard 14-15 mm wide kogai.<br/>
<br/>
The early Edo period "betsujin" (different person) Nobuie work will lack the quality in the metal, tekkotsu, finish and carving.  The plates are usually rather characterless and the working lacks subtlety.  The late Edo period revival pieces do indeed try to emulate the finish of the originals and as Alan mentioned some do a fairly good job.  In general, the working of the rim is a bit forced and overdone in these examples compared to the originals.  They obviously will look young, but there is also a somewhat artificial quality to them.  The same feeling comes from later copies of early Shino and Oribe ceramics.<br/>
<br/>
The metal, tekkotsu and yakite finish should lead to an Owari origin.  Remember that Kaneie worked in Kyoto, and everything about his guards is in line with Kyoto methods and aesthetics.<br/>

That's all I can think of at the moment.<br/>

Even though the rim is thick, the plate itself is fairly thin, so it's not as heavy as you might think.   Compared to earlier sukashi and ita tsuba though, it is heavy.  Nobuie was probably the first to make heavier guards, but I'd have to think about that a bit more.<br/>
<br/>
Regarding Owari iron, go back through the previous kantei two albums and as a group consider the metal, hammer work, tekkotsu and "melted" finish.  These are all typical of early Owari area work.  Also this album about tekkotsu<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://ph.groups.yahoo.com/group/nihontostudy/photos/browse/d4b0">http://ph.groups.yahoo.com/group/nihontostudy/photos/browse/d4b0</a> are all Owari region.<br/>
<br/>
By comparison Kyoto iron has a softer look to it, more homogenous, shows less modulation in the hammering, generally does not show prominent tekkotsu or a melted finish (although some Ko-Shoami will have this).  Some would say more refined, others would say more boring.  Think Kyo-sukashi, Heianjo, Onin, Kaneie, etc.  Usually it is more of a brown color rather than blue-black of Owari (all caveats about color in effect).<br/>
<br/>
It's probably not possible to explain without examples in hand, but try to look carefully at the photos.  Even with examples in hand it takes some years of effort to see.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1489625643">Thanks, Jim, for the quick pointers re: Owari iron.  All good to <br/>
know and remember.  I would imagine, too, that the particular period <br/>
one is considering would play a role, too, no?  I guess I would <br/>
expect that even Owari iron would be less "worked," less "dramatic" <br/>
with the coming of the Edo period...  <br/>
<br/>
On the weight of the Nobuiye, yes, if the plate is considerably <br/>
thinner than the rim, I could see where the tsuba wouldn't be quite <br/>
as heavy as it appears at first glance.  Interesting thoughts, too, <br/>
on Nobuiye being the first to develop heavier guards.  Is it correct <br/>
to suppose that the shift to the "two-hand swords" at the time of <br/>
Nobuiye might have been influential...?  Thanks again, Jim.<br/>

and ita tsuba though, it is heavy.  Nobuie was probably the first to <br/>
make heavier guards, but I'd have to think about that a bit more.<br/>

and "melted" finish.  These are all typical of early Owari area <br/>
work.  Also this album about tekkotsu<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > <br/>

prominent tekkotsu or a melted finish (although some Ko-Shoami will <br/>
have this).  Some would say more refined, others would say more <br/>
boring.  Think Kyo-sukashi, Heianjo, Onin, Kaneie, etc.  Usually it <br/>
is more of a brown color rather than blue-black of Owari (all <br/>
caveats about color in effect).<br/>

it takes some years of effort to see.<br/>
