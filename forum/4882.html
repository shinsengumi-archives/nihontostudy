<div id="ygrps-yiv-1547293452">Everyone,<br/>
����������������� Just thought I'd share this with you.  This is how things<br/>
go down in Canada.  I've copied and pasted the answer from my RCMP friend.<br/>
 <br/>
"So on to the legal question...in Canada you can use as much force as is<br/>
necessary to defend yourself and others but no more. In order words, you<br/>
must be able to justify the force you used. If burglar enters your home and<br/>
you surprise him (or her in a politically correct world) with sword in hand<br/>
and burglar flees...your done, the defence is complete. If, while burglar is<br/>
in the process of getting his/her butt out of your house you use your latest<br/>
iaido move to slice a pound of flesh off, you are in serious s**t.<br/>
Alternately, if burglar is armed and means to kill you for your meager<br/>
belongings and you use your best iaido move to slice a pound of flesh off,<br/>
then it becomes your word against his/hers. The most important<br/>
statement...you have to justify the force you used. The weapon you use is<br/>
irrelevant. You will have to explain why you used what you did and justify<br/>
it to satisfy a judge in court. THEN...there's the whole civil side of the<br/>
law. If, as a result of the pound of flesh you sliced off, burglar can no<br/>
longer function in society, can't hold a job and support him or herself<br/>
(even if that job is burglary) you might get your butt sued and will have to<br/>
support said burglar for a long time. In Canada it's all a matter of<br/>
justification of the force used."<br/>

The laws in England have changed much in the last few years. For<br/>
example, a gent was arrested, convicted and imprisoned for defending<br/>
himself in his own home using a sword against an unarmed burglar who had<br/>
broken into his house. I don't know specifically if possession of a<br/>
bladed weapon is a problem, but any aggressive or defense use likely is<br/>
a problem.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-199745056">I agree completely. It is all about the 'level of force' needed to <br/>
protect ones life from deadly harm. I too, am in law enforcment; I <br/>
work as a corrections deputy. The levels of force are studied yearly <br/>
in order to keep certification.<br/>
<br/>
But, I know of no thief who doesn't carry at least a screw driver and <br/>
when used properly, can be a deadly weapon. So rather than get sued <br/>
for maiming him (her) for life, I will prove beyond a reasonable <br/>
doubt, that the thief came after me to do bodily harm and thats why I <br/>
killed him.<br/>

I rest my case.<br/>

Chinese fakes on ebay though :-)<br/>
Pity they are all mumei though. Traditional weapons are a problem.<br/>
When carried at political rallies, the cops daren't try and take them<br/>
away for fear they are accused of disrespecting cultural items that<br/>
aren't weapons..just symbols.<br/>
I am sure there are parallels in the Japanese art world, where you<br/>
have to ignore the original status of items as weapons, and see them<br/>
in a new light as symbols of history and art.<br/>
