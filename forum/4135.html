Jingo eagles are not meant to be lifelike in the way, say that the Ishiguro would depict them but they are very powerful images of eagles. Your eagle/hawk is very stiff in execution and coarsely carved.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-344000252">I do not think it's always about how life like the portrayal of the bird <br/>
is Milt, but about how well the work is executed. In the case of the <br/>
Jingo tsuba, the light wash of gold over the iron I think is the <br/>
underlying beauty. The bird probably has little to do with it in <br/>
essence. I mean by that, it could be anything other than a bird. It is <br/>
the iron first, then the shape and the mimi, then the layout of the <br/>
seppa dai and hitsu ana and the design. Then step back and look at the <br/>
thing as a whole. It is why kinko mono is held in low esteem. Take away <br/>
average or poor work on the top, and there is nothing underneath.<br/>
<br/>
I remember a young collector Richard being educated by this bloke Milt <br/>
who spent days talking to him about Wabi-Sabi , it took him a while but <br/>
Richard finally sort of got it. The lesson was the aesthetic, the <br/>
underlying beauty, not what one thinks one sees on the surface. Sound <br/>
familiar ?.<br/>

	Along with the comments Richard made (I think it was Richard) about  <br/>
the quality of the iron and the overall presentation, what I think  <br/>
makes Jingo special is the character of the work. It is rustic, it is  <br/>
rough, yes but all the materials are worked and presented just so.  <br/>
Nothing more needs to be added, little or nothing could be removed  <br/>
without destroying the presentation.<br/>
	Was the first Jingo master a rustic who simply did things his way  <br/>
naturally with no thought as to the outcome? or was he as Hagihara  <br/>
has suggested a genius, who was repelled by the trends in kinko work  <br/>
around him, and inspired by the tea culture of his time to create  <br/>
works shockingly different from any other artist of his time?<br/>
	I can't answer the question, but I agree that if you compare the  <br/>
best of Jingo to other kinko works, it is shockingly different, it is  <br/>
solid, quiet but powerful and very befitting a samurai. A pleasant  <br/>
shock indeed, and I think  genius as well...<br/>

<br/>
You realize I would be the last person who would ever disagree with you, BUT as I have a soft spot for good Ko-Kinko tsuba I must tell you that you are blowing smoke, or perhaps having one of those wacky ones, when you make such a comment.<br/>
<br/>
Good Ko-Kinko has excellent nanako, very fine and even, painstakingly produced.  If it is uneven, and looks like Nagoya mono then chances are that is what it is.<br/>
<br/>
Good Ko-Kinko shakudo has a beautiful rich dark black purplish color not often found in later kinko works, good weight, and normally a floral or vines style of decoration, simple but elegant and very fine nanako, at least the ones I have.<br/>
<br/>
Just my .02 cents worth of course.<br/>

Now, this is a very old piece (pre-Edo, as in over 400 yrs) and it <br/>
does show some age.  This also may have been produced by repouse' <br/>
which is very delicate and can have the nanako easily blunted.  It <br/>
might have had a fukurin at one time but I'm not sure on the <br/>
construction method here.  As for the deer, it looks nice to me but <br/>
beauty is always in the eye of the beholder.  Simply put, I'd love to <br/>
be able to obtain this piece as it is a wonderful example of early <br/>
kinko workmanship, IMHO.<br/>

You cannot compare a ko-kinko tsuba of say, 1550, with an Ishiguro tsuba of around 1850, the taste of the times were totally different. Even the Goto family whose work remains relatively static in design over the centuries had to change and designs of the earlier period would not be saleable in the late Edo period (i.e. a single flute on a kozuka),<br/>

	Do you have an image of the deer tsuba you keep referring too? Can  <br/>
you direct me to a book I am likely to have where it may be found?<br/>
	You raised a question earlier, is the taste in schools like Jingo  <br/>
"learned" because the books and teachers all say it is good? I think  <br/>
that quality has to be "taught", you have to see and compare many  <br/>
fine examples to discern it. The teachers taste though may not become  <br/>
the students. Alan makes a good point, in that we have to know the  <br/>
tastes of the times to understand why certain themes and materials  <br/>
were used and what was seen as masterwork in one era may not compare  <br/>
well to those of another time. However we don't have to blindly  <br/>
follow the fashions of the past.<br/>
	If you like it, you like it. Buy and collect what you like. What we  <br/>
see as clunky and rustic in a bad way, appealed to someone at some  <br/>
point or your tsuba would not exist. It seems you like it and it  <br/>

Sorry, I don't agree with John, generally Aizu tsuba are low quality. The school was not supported by the local daimyo and they turned out mostly poor pieces, having said that there were a few makers who could produce better tsuba but nothing outstanding. The quality is way below that of even the average Waki-goto artists whose best work could rival that of the Goto main line.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Aizu Shoami from Torigoye, 'Tsuba, An Aesthetic Study', abridged:<br/>
<br/>
"By the Genroku era, and after, we have ample evidence of this school <br/>
in the mass production of inferior quality tsuba.  This work is <br/>
little better than shiiremono.  The style of this period was a <br/>
combination of Shoami and later Umetada school styles. ...  The poor <br/>
quality of Aizu Shoami tsuba is partially due to the fact that for <br/>
two hundred and twenty six years the Kato family governed this <br/>
province without giving their patronage to the Shoami artists who <br/>
lived there.  They made no effort to raise the level of the work <br/>
produced, or take an interest in its production. The workers of the <br/>
province were forced, as independent artists, to fend for themselves, <br/>
seeking work anywhere it might be available.  ...  At the end of the <br/>
Edo age there were two wholesale dealers of 'saikumono' (metal <br/>
handiwork) living at Wakamatsu in Aizu.  They employed many workers <br/>
to fill the orders for the mass productions of the Aizu Shoami <br/>
school. ... In Meiji/Taisho they produced all types of copies and <br/>
imitations for the Tokyo and foreign market.  In addition to the Aizu <br/>
style they made Heianjo brass inlay and Heianjo openwork, as well as <br/>
Nobuiye, Kaneiye, shingen and famous late kinko artist forgeries and <br/>
imitations.  In fact, they made any and all styles that had a ready <br/>
market with the foreigners of Europe and America.  This was the final <br/>
fate of the Aizu Shoami school".<br/>
<br/>
Personally I wouldn't draw a comparison with Bungo as they were a <br/>
very legitimate area of sword production and these became outright <br/>
forgeries and reproductions of poor quality in later Edo.  <br/>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-142558596">I have followed this discussion with great interest and will have to go over it<br/>
again I'm sure, but I clearly see what Milt is talking about.  To find a stiffer<br/>
deer one would have to go to the tundra...<br/>
<br/>
I recall well a tsuba that I found many years ago.  It was a small, copper<br/>
sanmai awase (if I correctly remember a phrase I haven't uttered for 15 or more<br/>
years!) with a touch of silver (tin??) showing stylised (stamped?) waves with a<br/>
creature on it that I always thought was an "over-endowed rabbit", but Bob<br/>
Haynes told me was a fox!!  I wrote to Bob when I saw a similar tsuba in one of<br/>
his catalogues.  I was amazed when he said this was a very early style of tsuba<br/>
ca 1300 - 1400.  I had it for years, often looking at it and saying "Do I like<br/>
it, or do I not??"  Same thing with this deer kinko.  I have gazed at Pete<br/>
Klein's image on yahoo (I actually have the Lundren Collection book, but it's<br/>
out on loan to a 'kinko' mate) for a long time on this sleepless night, and I<br/>
ask myself the same question all over again.  So David Z, if I could ask you a<br/>
question, when you say "I don't collect kinko at all,  but this is one of a<br/>
small number of cases which, granted a opportunity, would lead me to alter my<br/>
policy" I have to ask you "WHY??"  Please explain.<br/>
<br/>
If I found this very tsuba I would think it was junk.  I don't have to tell you<br/>
why.  Or do I??  The design spilling into the seppadai I have only seen on tsuba<br/>
I didn't care for.  The wobbly surface and incredibly bad nanako would kill it<br/>
for me.  And the stiff deer doesn't do anything for me at all.  However, I would<br/>
look at the larger than usual kozuka ana and opine "Hmmm, maybe it's early".<br/>
Back to my question to myself "Do I like it, or do I not".  If I don't like it,<br/>
I don't collect it, no matter what the aesthetes say.<br/>
<br/>
Now, this puts me into the rustic class, I know, but there is a point to this<br/>
that is not all derisory or derogatory.  It is this.  It is easy to pick<br/>
excellent work amongst Edo period tsuba , even in the iron "wabi-sabi" class,<br/>
but the archaic styles, the transition between (if we might say) conceptual<br/>
forerunners and the refined later schools is much, much more difficult.  Or is<br/>
it??  Recall here Milt's hawk tsuba that lead to the present discussion.  And I<br/>
can show you a tsuba that a well-educated (tsuba knowledge) mate of mine<br/>
dismissed as "late, possibly 1920s".  It is a masterwork of late Edo/early Meiji<br/>
and belongs to a friend of mine.  If he gives permission I'll put up some images<br/>
of it.<br/>
<br/>
So, to bring this to a close, are there any others inhabiting the same closet as<br/>
I???  I know I'm lacking an ability, an aesthetic if you like, to appreciate the<br/>
stiff deer kinko in question and it worries me.  It seems without thorough study<br/>
and training many tsuba in this time frame would indeed be considered junk and<br/>
sold off, possibly to an ignominious fate.  The other kinko that Pete shows in<br/>
two images at the same link does "speak to me".  It is from the same time frame<br/>
and I find it elegant and refined and would collect it.  I think this discussion<br/>
parallels the Sue Koto kazuuchimono line of thinking with blades - I don't<br/>
collect those either...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-567492144">My My Grandma, what big hitsuana you have!!!<br/>
<br/>
Where did that fake tsuba in the black and white image come from!!!!  Ah, this<br/>
is indeed a different kettle of fish.  I think even Milt might say that this<br/>
deer is kicking with a bit of life!!  I iamgine that in the hand it would look<br/>
even better?  I look forward to reading further discussion on this tsuba and<br/>
Ko-Kinko in general.  Here I must mention Robert Burawoy's little picture book<br/>
of early tsuba.  I don't have it immediately to hand but Msr Burawoy discusses<br/>
early tsuba types with the passion that appears to come from serious and<br/>
hard-won knowledge.  I'll dig it out and read it again in conjunction with the<br/>
present discussion.  Could I suggest that those of you who have followed this<br/>
discussion with interest should seek out Msr Burawoy's little book if you don't<br/>
already have it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-509375076">David's tsuba of the maple tree with leaves shows greater <br/>
sophistication in detail than the original deer/maple tsuba being <br/>
discussed. The branches really give a wood feeling with a minimum of <br/>
carved accents. The original tsuba I believe is a simple <br/>
representation of a still/quiet moment, unmoving, of deer in a <br/>
glade. A brief instant of peace/harmony. Quite opposed to, as in a <br/>
discussion I have had recently, where certain sukashi motif depict <br/>
motion. The stiffness that some observe is, I think, this frozen <br/>
tableau and intentional. John<br/>

<br/>
I just remembered that we never finished discussing that great Ko Kinko tsuba with the Kasugane motif. <br/>
<br/>
I'm particularly fond of the deer. I've added to the photo on the web-page an illustration from a book on Paleolithic art, describing the same combination of perspectives we see in the deer on the tsuba.  This very ancient approach to perspective is not naturalistic in the way we are normally accustomed to seeing, but I think, in the case of this tsuba, it very successfully communicates the kind of imperfect image of deer we receive, looking from a distance in less than optimum light at moving animals. <br/>
<br/>
I think the imperfection of the perspective makes this tsuba more exciting than a it would be if it featured a much more literally modeled image.  And the archaic quality, the comparative roughness of the representation of the deer, on the elegant kinko background is more dramatic by the virtue of the extreme contrast between image and background.             <br/>

<br/>
  I have followed this discussion with great interest and will have to go over it<br/>
  again I'm sure, but I clearly see what Milt is talking about.  To find a stiffer<br/>
  deer one would have to go to the tundra...<br/>
<br/>
  I recall well a tsuba that I found many years ago.  It was a small, copper<br/>
  sanmai awase (if I correctly remember a phrase I haven't uttered for 15 or more<br/>
  years!) with a touch of silver (tin??) showing stylised (stamped?) waves with a<br/>
  creature on it that I always thought was an "over-endowed rabbit", but Bob<br/>
  Haynes told me was a fox!!  I wrote to Bob when I saw a similar tsuba in one of<br/>
  his catalogues.  I was amazed when he said this was a very early style of tsuba<br/>
  ca 1300 - 1400.  I had it for years, often looking at it and saying "Do I like<br/>
  it, or do I not??"  Same thing with this deer kinko.  I have gazed at Pete<br/>
  Klein's image on yahoo (I actually have the Lundren Collection book, but it's<br/>
  out on loan to a 'kinko' mate) for a long time on this sleepless night, and I<br/>
  ask myself the same question all over again.  So David Z, if I could ask you a<br/>
  question, when you say "I don't collect kinko at all,  but this is one of a<br/>
  small number of cases which, granted a opportunity, would lead me to alter my<br/>
  policy" I have to ask you "WHY??"  Please explain.<br/>
<br/>
  If I found this very tsuba I would think it was junk.  I don't have to tell you<br/>
  why.  Or do I??  The design spilling into the seppadai I have only seen on tsuba<br/>
  I didn't care for.  The wobbly surface and incredibly bad nanako would kill it<br/>
  for me.  And the stiff deer doesn't do anything for me at all.  However, I would<br/>
  look at the larger than usual kozuka ana and opine "Hmmm, maybe it's early".<br/>
  Back to my question to myself "Do I like it, or do I not".  If I don't like it,<br/>
  I don't collect it, no matter what the aesthetes say.<br/>
<br/>
  Now, this puts me into the rustic class, I know, but there is a point to this<br/>
  that is not all derisory or derogatory.  It is this.  It is easy to pick<br/>
  excellent work amongst Edo period tsuba , even in the iron "wabi-sabi" class,<br/>
  but the archaic styles, the transition between (if we might say) conceptual<br/>
  forerunners and the refined later schools is much, much more difficult.  Or is<br/>
  it??  Recall here Milt's hawk tsuba that lead to the present discussion.  And I<br/>
  can show you a tsuba that a well-educated (tsuba knowledge) mate of mine<br/>
  dismissed as "late, possibly 1920s".  It is a masterwork of late Edo/early Meiji<br/>
  and belongs to a friend of mine.  If he gives permission I'll put up some images<br/>
  of it.<br/>
<br/>
  So, to bring this to a close, are there any others inhabiting the same closet as<br/>
  I???  I know I'm lacking an ability, an aesthetic if you like, to appreciate the<br/>
  stiff deer kinko in question and it worries me.  It seems without thorough study<br/>
  and training many tsuba in this time frame would indeed be considered junk and<br/>
  sold off, possibly to an ignominious fate.  The other kinko that Pete shows in<br/>
  two images at the same link does "speak to me".  It is from the same time frame<br/>
  and I find it elegant and refined and would collect it.  I think this discussion<br/>
  parallels the Sue Koto kazuuchimono line of thinking with blades - I don't<br/>
  collect those either...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-262691624">David, I agree with everything you are saying except the moving <br/>
animals thing. This is a frozen moment of perhaps decision or <br/>
indecision. Only subjective of course. Lighting, well is it the time <br/>
of day or the shade of the tree? John<br/>
