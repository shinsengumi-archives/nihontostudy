> In fact, a famous sword Okita used at Ikeda-ya (one supposedly made<br/>

> seen on most websites being sold as "Okita's favorite".<br/>
><br/>
> According to some sources, after that sword broke, he used a sword<br/>
> made by Yamatonokami Yasusada. The sword was 2.2 shaku long<br/>
> according to a source at www.n-p-s.net/aitoh.htm , but my<br/>
> photocopied page from a swordbook (name of book lost long ago) says<br/>
> it was 2 shaku, 3 sun, and 6 bu long.<br/>
><br/>
> On a side note, OishiKuwajiro (known by the nickname"<br/>
> hitokirikuwajiro) also used a sword made by Yamatonokami Yasusada<br/>
> that was 2 shaku 5 sun in length according to this site<br/>
> www.bakusin.com/jiten41.html<br/>
><br/>
> Okita's most famous sword, though, was the "Kikuichimonji", which<br/>
> was 2 shaku 4 sun 2 bu in length. There is some speculation as to<br/>
> whether he actually owned such a valuable sword, but we will<br/>
> probably never know if he really owned it since it was supposedly<br/>
> lost after he died. If you are interested in reading more about it,<br/>
> I recommend Shinsengumi Keppuroku by Shiba Ryotaro.<br/>
><br/>
> As far as the swords being accurate, for sure Hijikata's is<br/>
> accurate. Unfortunately the model on that page is the "affordable<br/>
> model". The exact replica which is listed on Ozawa swords Japan is<br/>
> quite a bit more.<br/>
><br/>
> Okita's replica is in what they call handachi (han-dachi)mounts,<br/>
> literally "half tachi" mounts, which come from the pre-edo periods<br/>
> where there was a transition from tachi to katana. Unfortunately,<br/>
> i've seen conflicting data on if his Ichimonji blade was mounted in<br/>
> handachi mounts. He owned one other sword besides the Kiku Ichimonji<br/>
> and that one could have been the one mounted handachi style." I hope<br/>
