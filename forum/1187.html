<div id="ygrps-yiv-1793745270">Hi all - <br/>
<br/>
As a follow-up on my earlier question regarding the mei of Shigekatsu, Mishina Keji replied that it reads: "Kanayama Oite Jinya Shonai ju" which--correct me if I'm wrong--that this was made at the Shonai shrine in Kanayama???  (I should have asked Mishina Kenji about this but I didn't want to be pesty.)<br/>

  Hi all - <br/>
<br/>
  Perhaps one of you can translate this place-name for me (linked to Yahoo photos, below):<br/>

  The shinshin-to (dated 1860) is signed by a Shigekatsu who I "suspect" is associated with the shinshin-to Kaga smith Tomokatsu, but I'm not at all positive of that. I must give up trying to translate this place of residence as in the mei. Maybe we can all learn something from it? (I've written Mishina Kenji about this reading but thought the groups would enjoy the challenge. <br/>
<br/>
  Thanks!<br/>
