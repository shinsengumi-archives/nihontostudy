<h3>Interesting Sword</h3>
by <i>dwmac2000</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-884982507">Hello Again,<br/>
<br/>
I've managed to post a few photos in my album titled " Interesting <br/>
Sword."  The pictures are mediocre at best, but will hopefully show <br/>
some of its charactoristics.  The grain lines in the hada 2 photo <br/>
actually shine brightly as opposed to what is seen in the picture.<br/>
There is a bit of the hamon which can be seen in the upper section <br/>
of the hamon 1 photo.  The sword is in obvious need of polish.  It <br/>
laid on the battlefield at Okinawa during WWll for several days <br/>
before being discovered by a young Marine.  It was stored away with <br/>
little or no attention since.  Oddly, the sword seemed to have found <br/>
me as opposed to the other way around.<br/>
<br/>
I'm trying to research the sword and have a little knowledge from <br/>
research I did on swords my Father brought home from WWll as a 11th <br/>
Airborne Paratrooper.  I didn't realize what I was getting into!<br/>
<br/>
I've had some much appreciated input from Ron and Ricky.  I still <br/>
think judging from the Nakago condition the sword is most likely a <br/>
Bakumatsu era Ko-to copy.  If anyone should happen to have opinion <br/>
as to time period or otherwise based on the photos it would be again <br/>
greatly appreciated!<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Based on the images, it needs to be determined whether this sword has <br/>
been exposed to serious heat. The scaly-dry appearance of the steel <br/>
is an indication that it might have been. Fires were a problem <br/>
throughout Japan's history that affected many swords. There are <br/>
articles written that describe to some degree what characteristics to <br/>
look for. <br/>
In general, this is one lesson many beginners unfortunately <br/>
experience at one time or another. <br/>

Thank you,  Fire damage is something I had not considered.  I've seen a<br/>
few articles concerning the characteristics of swords subjected to<br/>
intense heat.  I will definitely reread them and pay more attention as I<br/>
do!!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again,<br/>

<h3>Re: Interesting Sword</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-300054844">Franco,<br/>
<br/>
Just an update as you were kind enough to offer advice and  an opinion. <br/>
I reread a JSSUS article by T.C. Ford regarding fire damaged blades and<br/>
retempering.  After reading this article and others, I can say with a<br/>
reasonable amount of confidence , Hamon loss due to fire and retempering<br/>
is not the case with this blade.<br/>
<br/>
The blade is obviously not in top condition and I also adjusted the<br/>
photo scene balance in order to hopefully enhance the grain pattern. <br/>
The pictures do look as though the sword at some time had been recovered<br/>
from a fire. Particularly the Hada 2 and 3, but the sword really doesn't<br/>
appear that brown or scaly.<br/>
<br/>
Due to the rough condition of the sword the  Hamon is there, but not<br/>
that visible.  I really feel as though the sword has not had polish<br/>
since the original. ( There doesn't seem to be any reduction from Nakago<br/>
to blade).  I can also say the sword would look absolutely stunning with<br/>
a fresh polish.   Future decision....<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
<br/>
Dave<br/>
