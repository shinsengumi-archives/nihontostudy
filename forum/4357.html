 </span></blockquote>I've never heard of ancestral/antique blades having been<br/>
given a Showa stamp. All I've ever heard is that Showa<br/>
stamps are Showa period made blades; mostly non-traditionally<br/>
made blades.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1961984773">I'm asking because I have a blade which has all the hallmarks of a <br/>

than most WWII blades (ha is 26.75").  It also has a Showa cherry <br/>

Its matching saya is also unusual--it is covered in a tan-colored same <br/>

I've seen several pieces that were nontraditionally made that had hada, <br/>
interesting hamons, etc.,.  There were some interesting comments in<br/>
one of Kapp's books about how some of these were made with wrought iron <br/>
from train rails.<br/>
<br/>
One other thing to look for is nie - no nie usually means not <br/>
traditionally made.<br/>
