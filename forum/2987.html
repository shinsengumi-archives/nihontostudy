<h3>tsuba box kanji</h3>
by <i>davidzincavage</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1358504833">A new tsuba came in today, in an interesting box of a form I have not seen.  The inside cloth portion was recessed to fit the tsuba.  No centerpiece to come off and expose the nails.  <br/>
<br/>
The box's side had some kanji.  Could this be a reference to the particular tsuba, which has lightning inlaid in zogan.<br/>

The kanji say Akasaka, written right to left.  Usually things written on the side of boxes are group or motif names that make it easy for the owner to pull a given piece out of a stack.  What does the tsuba in the box look like?<br/>

It's the one linked by this url.  And as I said below the box interior was fitted to this particular tsuba.  What about fukurin, Jim?  Was the fukurin rim typically added later ? as a repair?  Or was it commonly an original feature?<br/>

It's Heianjo-zogan.  This fukurin is probably a later addition.  The way that the decoration crowds and crosses the edge gives me the sense that the plate was cut down a bit.  A fukurin was typically added to a guard that was cut down or otherwise damaged at the edge.  There are plenty of tsuba with original fukurin too, usually for aesthetic reasons.  Also, functional original fukurin were used to bind the edge of three layer copper alloy guards or on nerikawa tsuba.  Some fukurin (original or added) may have been intended to keep the edge of a guard from catching on or damaging clothing.  <br/>
<br/>
The motif isn't lightning.  It's a very loose manju/key-fret design.  I don't recall the Japanese term.  The Raijin guard shows the square-spiral typical of the ends of lightning.  <br/>
<br/>
I don't know what relationship the kanji on the edge of the box have to the tsuba.  Of course the interior can be fitted to the guard even if the box was used before. <br/>
