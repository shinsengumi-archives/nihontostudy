I haven't seen a signed example.  Here's a drawing from Kajihara's Visual Glossary:<br/>

The rough lines show the direction of the very fine file marks in the gold.  It's a multi piece construction.  The flat, wide base plate is probably the most obvious diagnostic feature, but once you've seen a few the type stands out.  I probably have a photo of an actual example somewhere, but this will have to do for now.  If anyone has a photo please post it or send it to me for posting.<br/>
<br/>
The style and quality of file work is also seen in solid gold Umetada tsuba. <br/>
