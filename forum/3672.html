<h3>ukiyo-e Japanese war prints</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-173500530">Hi all -<br/>
<br/>
Today's St. Louis Post-Dispatch has an interesting article featuring a local collector of Japanese "war prints" -- woodblock prints -- from the wars with China (1894) and Russia (1904). Not a lot of detail but an interesting write-up neverthless. Thought some of you might enjoy reading it. <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://tinyurl.com/8acwl">http://tinyurl.com/8acwl</a><br/>
<br/>
Obviously this collector and his wife are upper-crust St.Louisans and probably not too accessible, but it sounds like one day they hope to exhibit their collection which would be nice. Again, just passing it along. I'm sure there are a number of list members who collect such war prints. I've always found these interesting but have never allowed myself "another interest." Have enough!!<br/>

(Might try to sit in on one of his lectures sometime, if I can hear about it scheduled somewhere.) He also makes some comments about disposal of one's collection. <br/>

"Collecting, an Unruly Passion, Psychological  Perspectives" by Werner Muensterberger is an interesting if sometimes slightly uncomfortably accurate read.  (Princeton University Press, 1994.)<br/>
