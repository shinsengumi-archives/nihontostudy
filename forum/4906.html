<h3>Boys sword...</h3>
by <i>sworddad</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-867790033">Hi all - <br/>
<br/>
Quiet weekend. Thought I'd ask if anyone knows of any factual articles or simply some background information on those miniature "Boys swords" that we sometimes see from time to time. Some of these appear pretty low-end quality while on occasion, some real workmanship shows up. <br/>
<br/>
Personally, I've never had much interest in these but recently, a very nice quality one was brought to me here in St. Louis by an antique appraiser friend. Now I own it. What impressed me was the nice quality of the fittings, the baleen wrapping and a very handsome, well forged blade. The blade appears to be signed Bizen Osafune Morimitsu and is dated Oei 5 but more likely, from what I've gathered, it is more likely a shinshinto creation made as a Morimitsu. Hamon is a narrow suguha with ko-nei with a boshi swept in ko-nie (hakikake). Bo hi and an extended kissaki, male/female mekugi with "mellon" crest. Quite a nice "package" as we say. <br/>
<br/>
I've been told some of these were for export, but others were indeed made for presentation during coming-of-age. It would seem that somebody would know more detail about these swords or perhaps know of an authoritative article on them somewhere. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-466433974">Hi Rich - <br/>
<br/>
No, I don't recall seeing those at Choshuya but then my aging brain was on its way to overload at that time.  I kind of figure "quality is quality" and if it exists, enjoy and appreciate it. I'll be curious is there was ever an article written about these miniatures. My friend (trained as a goldsmith) seems to think one seppa is solid gold which if so, would indicate something.<br/>
