<div id="ygrps-yiv-1561951514">Hi:<br/>
 No, the images you attached are all photographs of well known and often<br/>
illustrated Nobuiye. Akiyama, who died in 1936, was the foremost<br/>
researcher on tsuba, particularly iron. of his day, and has left a<br/>
lasting impression on the categorization of tsuba to this day. He<br/>
collected dozens and dozens of oshigata of Nobuiye, some very<br/>
unassuming, as was the found one I refereed to, and they were published<br/>
by a Mr. Nakayama, or Nakamura or something close to that (only my poor<br/>
brain as a reference here). When you see one like the example you asked<br/>
about, what makes me suspicious is the "pulled out of the fire" look it<br/>
has and the lack of depth and sharpness to the chisel work. Those done<br/>
by the Norisuke, I and II, often look quite good, but they must be<br/>
examined in hand. They often are deficient on the part of the mimi you<br/>
don't see from a photograph, as it is said they tended to work from<br/>
books that did not illustrate the sides, or that is one story I have<br/>
heard.<br/>
 There are many many gimei Owari Nobuiye out there as his work was very<br/>
much in vogue during the early 19th Cent. revival period. One the other<br/>
hand there were other, entirely legitimate Nobuiye working elsewhere,<br/>
and they are entirely worthy collectors' pieces in many cases. <br/>
 The dealer, that should probably remain confidential to him.<br/>
 I hope this helps.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi Arnold, thanks for the response. Did you mean the book that these<br/>
scans<br/>
came from? <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.jpsword.com/files/kn/nobuiye.html">http://www.jpsword.com/files/kn/nobuiye.html</a><br/>
This webpage is very good for making side by side comparisons with the<br/>
pix<br/>
on Mr. Weissberg's website. I think I can see the sutble differences in<br/>
the<br/>
mei now, or perhaps I want to believe I can *grin*. Some more pointers<br/>
in<br/>
this direction might be good for me all the same. Are there any<br/>
specifics to<br/>
look for besides the 'softness'?<br/>
<br/>
With regards to the Akiyama tsuba that was found, the mind boggles how<br/>
it<br/>
wound up on a table at a sword show in the US among a pile of other<br/>
tsuba!<br/>

Ps. I know I shouldn't ask, but who was the lucky finder?<br/>
