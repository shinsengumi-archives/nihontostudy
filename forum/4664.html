<h3>Book Question on Kogai</h3>
by <i>klepet33319</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1126214636">Jim, Gordon, Alan et.al.;  do you know if the book(s) 'Kogai', 'Ko <br/>
Kogai' and 'Furukogai' are one in the same?  I have been reading some <br/>
descriptions from the Sotheby London 9 November 2004 catalog and they <br/>
list 'Furukogai' and 'Ko Kogai' as well as the 'Mitokoro Shu' by Ikeda <br/>
which I already have.  I have been attempting to find research books on <br/>
kogai and, although I know they are all difficult to locate, it would <br/>
be of great help knowing if there is actually more than one book to be <br/>
looking for.<br/>
Thanks as always!<br/>

Furukogai and Ko-Kogai are the same book, just two different readings.  It's definitely worth getting.  I can't think of a book titled just Kogai.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1934588129">Thanks much Jim!  I got thrown by the use of the different names in the <br/>
same Sotheby catalog.  One listing would be for Ko Kogai, another for <br/>
Furukogai, etc.  Possibly they had different people doing the <br/>
attributions therefore creating an apparent inconsistency.  <br/>
I wish it was as easy to find a copy of the damn book as it was to find <br/>
the answer! LOL  It's like trying to pick up a copy of Furukawa's <br/>
Collection -- not easy.<br/>
Thanks again!</div>
