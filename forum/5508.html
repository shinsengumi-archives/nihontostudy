<h3>NSR - just raising funds...</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-131731440">Hi all - <br/>
<br/>
In the spirit of the holiday shopping season...I would like to get material for a moment and mention a few very nice swords that are for sale from my collection. I've placed four swords on consignment with Danny Massey. Check out www.nihontocraft.com  and have a look. Swords are: nidai Tsuda Sukehiro, ko-Uda, Echizen Kanenori and a mumei Seki Kanenori. <br/>
<br/>
I've asked Danny to lower prices on my things as a LIMITED TIME HOLIDAY SALE in hopes of stimulating some buying interest. Just trying to reimburse some sword funding folks. Take a look and maybe you'll be tempted to put another package under your tree! <br/>
<br/>
Questions? All sword sales will go through Danny but I'm happy to answer any questions you might have regarding my items. Privately, off-list please at: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:swords@...">swords@...</a> <br/>
<br/>
BOOKS - My intentions of working up an illustrated listing of a dozen or so titles I've got for sale has not yet materialize. However, if anyone is looking for something to add to their library, email me privately off-list and I'll at least send you my list of titles and prices. Of these titles, I still have ~20 copies of the Kokusai Tosogu Kai (KTK) 2008 4th International Convention publications available at $90 pp (U.S.)  Books can be shipped in time for Christmas to a U.S. address. For a listing, email me OFF-LIST at: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:swords@...">swords@...</a> <br/>
<br/>
Sorry for the lengthy marketing email but it gets the word out. <br/>
<br/>
