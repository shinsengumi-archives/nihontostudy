I am quite  pleasantly surprised that the tsuba was given an <br/>
attribution of " mid edo Hoan " by the shinsa team headed by Hagihara <br/>
sensei.<br/>
I recall we discussed this tsuba long time ago on this list that this <br/>
is most likely  a Shoami on an average day or a Umetada ( or <br/>
Myochin ) on a very very good day.<br/>
<br/>
You mentioned briefly that it has something to do with the beveling <br/>
of the guard which I don't quite understand. Can you elaborate on <br/>
that ?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks........<br/>
<br/>
p.s.  Just found out from an old timer that it is indeed good luck to <br/>
wear pink on shinsa day.<br/>
That guy in pink tee shirt submitted one of the highest point score <br/>
tsuba !!<br/>

Interesting. I have one exactly like it and there is also one<br/>
on Robert Coles' site like it. Would never have thought Hoan<br/>
in my wildest imagination (which is pretty wild at times :-)<br/>

That design was used by several groups.  As usual with iron guards, a lot of the kantei comes in seeing the characteristics of the metal and its treatment in person.  The Kodai Hoan attribution came because the raised edges around the sukashi and mimi were formed by etching, a characteristic of later Hoan work.  Also remember that Kodai (later generation) Hoan is a different level of attribution than Hoan.  I'm glad that you're happy with the attribution, I think it's a good one and certainly a lot more fun than Shoami.<br/>
<br/>
It worked the other way on your dragon and Fuji-san tsuba, which was in Yanagawa style as you pointed out, but in person was not up to the level of Naoharu's work.  The dragon was very nicely chiseled, but the work was attributed to Mito Kinko, which matched my earlier "internet kantei" as I recall.<br/>
<br/>
Mr. Pink Shirt didn't get one of the highest point values, but his guard by a very important maker did pass and was one of the highlights of the shinsa.  It was a great day for all concerned.  We had some really fine pieces come through.<br/>
<br/>
Milt, thanks for your hours manning the copy machine and outgoing table.  This shinsa was a bit different and we couldn't have done it without the people who stepped up to the job.  Moses Becerra, Tom Helm, Arnold Frenzel, John White, Fred Geyer and Bob Holcomb gave up most or all of their "show time" to make the shinsa happen, including some late night and very early morning hours for a few on Thursday/Friday.  I'm sure I'll kick myself soon for forgetting to mention someone by name, but big thanks to all who did the work.<br/>

All kidding aside, there is nothing wrong with Shoami, right ?<br/>
Sort of like " Bungo Takada swords " of tsuba world ?<br/>
<br/>
Question regarding the yagyu guard.............<br/>
Besides the quality of the iron + the " masame like bones ? " on the <br/>
mimi, why Yagyu ?  <br/>
To my untrained eyes, the design looks Shoami or certainly not the <br/>
usual waves based design that's typical of that school.<br/>
Is that particular design listed in the Yagyu design book ?  An old <br/>
timer told me there's such a book.  True ?<br/>
<br/>
Again, thanks, it was fun making copies........just like that <br/>

Yes, Shoami can be great.  As with Bungo Takada there are both very good ones and poor ones.  I personally like good Ko-Shoami work a lot.  <br/>
<br/>
You're talking about the Yagyu guard with the dice game motif that went through while you were working the first day?  The quality of the iron and the work in the rim are the most important kantei points, so don't forget what you saw.  That shape is a distinctive Yagyu trait -- curved sides, almost straight top and bottom, sometimes with a "bump" in the middle.  Of course there are also plenty of round ones.  The design of dice and gaming chips is very unusual for Yagyu (or anyone else).  I'm not sure what to make of it, made for a gambler? <br/>
<br/>
Yes there is a Yagyu design book.  I have a photocopy of a hand-drawn copy, which was copied from another hand drawn copy.  This design is not in it, but I've seen other Yagyu designs that do not appear in the book.  It's an interesting document, but not the final word on Yagyu (at least the copy I have, there may be other variations).  Yagyu is a very complicated topic.<br/>
