Your link is one of the few that doesn't senationalise the attack, simply<br/>
reporting a "sword" as being used.  Just about everthing else in print and<br/>
electronic media reported "samurai sword".  See for example:<br/>

Within a couple of days there was another "samurai sword" attack on the other<br/>
side of Melbourne:<br/>

<br/>
Here is a bulletin board thread discussing a case in the UK that may be of<br/>
interest, seeing this issue appears to be well on the way to becoming a<br/>
world-wide phenomenon:<br/>

From the few photos I've seen of the incident David Zincavage refers to the<br/>
sword looks like a repro of some sort - it's gunto-like but the tsuba is just<br/>
too brilliantly gold for it to be a real one.  In a couple of months or so I'll<br/>
be retired and I intend to follow up on these with the police to identify all<br/>
the swords involved in "samurai sword" attacks here in Victoria leading up to<br/>
the infamous, ignorant and outrageous laws that we are well aware of.  John's<br/>
email (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:excelsiorilluminati@...">excelsiorilluminati@...</a>) spoke of:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > These attacks on people with 'Samurai Swords' are<br/>
> the exact reason there has been legislation enacted<br/>
> already with more being contemplated in certain parts<br/>
> of the world.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>More information please.  I think my home state of Victoria here in Oz was the<br/>
first in the West to introduce laws as a direct result of "samurai sword"<br/>
attacks, and we have heard of the Scottish move.  Anything else??  Any more<br/>
details??  Perhaps it might be better to reply to me offline in this<br/>
"developmental" stage??  We can take the list's time and bandwidth in the event<br/>
of concrete actions by legislators.  OR - keep the discussion online until<br/>
someone complains??  Personally I'm 'red-hot' on somehow correcting the<br/>
ignorance of our legislature here in Victoria as well as the media.  Not sure<br/>
how I'll go about a one-man, retired old geezer moral minority campaign gainst<br/>
abysmal ignorance, but once retired I'll have 'the rest of my life' to get into<br/>
it...<br/>
