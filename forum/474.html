<h3>umegane-good or bad?</h3>
by <i>Peter A Bleed</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-526942347">Listeros!<br/>
      Allow me to once again present the limits of knowledge with a<br/>
question that others may find either 1) of interest or  2) answerable.<br/>
      Yesterday I looked at a "sword" brought home from the Philippines and<br/>
owned (proudly) by the nephew of the man who sent it home in 1944. Since<br/>
this could be anything and not likely for sale, I think we will all agree<br/>
that the chances of this being of any interest were pretty slim.  Surprise,<br/>
it turned out to b a relatively clean wakizashi in a nice old shira-saya.<br/>
The blade was signed Fujishima Tomoshige, I assume one of the late<br/>
koto/very early Shinto Kaga smiths of that line - tight itame with a<br/>
komidare. A sword.<br/>
      Perhaps the most interesting thing about the sword was a rectangular<br/>
umegane set into the shinogi-ji in the monouchi. It measured maybe 1/4" by<br/>
1/2" and was clearly visible. It had not fully removed the flaw since there<br/>
was a clear fukure on its edge.<br/>
      My question to the List is whether on not this kind of umegane is<br/>
good or bad. Well, it can hardly be "good," right? There was a flaw there,<br/>
but an umegane must be better than a flaw, right? Does an umegane detract<br/>
from or enhance the value of a sword?  And how visible should an umegane<br/>
be?  Is the fact that this plug was clearly visible - and square! - mean<br/>
that it was poorly done?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-92644165">Hi Peter,<br/>
<br/>
I don't know if this has been answered yet, but, in general umegane are<br/>
always bad, particularly if they are easy to spot. In a blade like this<br/>
Fujishima where open, flowing grain in the shinogi-ji is to be expected,<br/>
doing an umegane is just silly. The same is true with a very fine omi-yari I<br/>
own that is hugh. It also has a series of rectangular umegane that have<br/>
mostly fallen out. The blade is Kanabo and one should expect powerful<br/>
running masame that opens up in places in such a work. There is no reason to<br/>
do umegane and now that they are visible and have fallen out, it detracts a<br/>
great deal from the blade. On the other had, I have a rather nice katana<br/>
where the umegane had fallen out. I had it replaced. You can't see it and it<br/>
looks better now as opposed to the open hole in the skin. So, a case by case<br/>
answer. Just my 25 cents worth.<br/>

anyone happen to know when umegane were developed. I assume that they would<br/>

Not really sure about that. I would expect late Edo or so and I am sure they<br/>
must have been a cheap fix. I do not know how much the umegane work on my<br/>
own sword will run, but I was told it was expensive.<br/>

According  to Inami Hakusui in his book " Nippon-to, the Japanese Sword " <br/>
published in 1948 , the cost of sword polish done in  Japan " is about four <br/>

So the cost of umegane cannot be that much more ( at that time, i.e. )?<br/>
