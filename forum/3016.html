<h3>Heading East...have swords for sale</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1272204686">Hi All - <br/>
<br/>
Have begun a major "fund raising" venture which means I've pulled a number of very nice swords out of my collection, sacrificed to the cause. (Not all THAT dramatic but...) I am going to try and continue to seek out some buyers while out in the Philadelphia (Marcus Hook) area the last half of this month, so I plan on carrying my "wares" with me in hopes of a sale or two local to that area. So...if any of you live close enough to Marcus Hook (just south of Philly) and would like to perhaps connect with me to see what's available, please, let me know. Contact me off-list at: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:swords@...">swords@...</a> for more information as to what I'm parting with, if interested. <br/>
