I agree.  But, I think that Soten-style work was produced by others through the end of the Edo period.  Most of it is poor quality, but some is not. <br/>

  The work on the tsuba is very good but the shape seems so late, perhaps<br/>
  1800-40, I'm puzzled that I have never seen anything by Soten that would<br/>
  fill the gap between Soten II and this tsuba, a gap of maybe 50 or more<br/>
  years. Do you agree?<br/>
