Indeed, I think I am familiar with this sentiment. I believe the American<br/>
version is, "The check is in the mail."<br/>

<h3>Nihonto Trader is closed</h3>
by <i>retalt</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1419542028">All, I closed Nihonto Trader 2 weeks early. It had not had any visitors <br/>
since I announced it's closure and all funds had dried up and as such it <br/>
was covered in advertising so I thought, nows the time to go.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any and all participation.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers<br/>
