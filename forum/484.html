<div id="ygrps-yiv-1059088681">Well, his drawing techniques for the blade wouldn't help the rendering of the nakago.  If anything, keeping the representation of the nakago consistent with the way the blade is drawn would probably result in a strange looking oshigata.  Maybe it's just easier to just avoid the problem. <br/>

Still, you would think it<br/>
would include an oshigata of the signture for the signed pieces. I think it<br/>
is a bit ambiguous.<br/>
