Haynes and Wakayama list a Tosa Myochin Kuniyoshi.  Died ca. 1800, which is actually a bit early for the group.  I don't think I've seen any as early as the 1600's - Sasano dates them to the late Edo period.  They took many of their designs from the Akasaka and some from Higo groups (as the later Akasaka did themselves).  Some of them supposedly studied with later Akasaka makers.  Their work can be quite good.  Cary had a nice signed Tosa Myochin guard on his table in SF.  It looked so much like an Akasaka guard that one of our club members asked me which generation it was by.  <br/>

I haven't studied Tosa Myochin guards closely enough to come up with something that is unique about them other than the signature or tagane-mei if present.  Usually it is more a matter of lacking attributes that would normally be found on earlier mainline Akasaka or Higo piece.  With Akasaka or Higo guards of the same period there is very little if any difference between the best Tosa Myochin work and the originals.  Even with lesser work, there are pieces that are a toss up between later followers of the original groups or the lesser Tosa Myochin.  <br/>
<br/>
In general it can be very difficult to determine the maker of unsigned mid to lower level work in the mid to late Edo periods.  People could and did make whatever the customer wanted.  Sometimes you'll run across the signature of a maker that would not have even made your best guess list if the piece was mumei.  <br/>
<br/>
I'll have to take a closer look at the signed Tosa Myochin pieces in the future to see if I can pick up any clues.<br/>

Your piece does not have the classic Tosa Myochin-style tagane-mei, but I don't think that all pieces do.  A better photo would be helpful, but from what I can see the signature on your piece is not out of line with the one illustrated in Wakayama.<br/>
<br/>
Regarding Wakayama, there are two works that are routinely referred to as "Wakayama."  The first is the one I just referenced which is the three volume Toso Kodogu Meiji Taikei, published in 1978.  This is a book of photos of mei with brief information on the makers.  The Wakayama that I referred to in the previous email was his Toso Kinko Jiten, published in 1984.  This has no photos, but is a single volume of biographical information on fittings makers.<br/>
<br/>
Less frequently referred to but no less valuable is Wakayama's 1972, 8 volume Toso Kodogu Koza, which is an illustrated encyclopedia of sword fittings.<br/>
<br/>
Haynes is Robert Haynes' The Index of Japanese Sword Fittings and Associated Artists, published in 2001.  It is similar to Toso Kinko Jiten, but expanded and in English.  It's a three volume set with no photographs, but the largest available listing of makers.<br/>
<br/>
FWIW, there is a Tosa Myochi Kuniyoshi tsuba in the first Compton sale catalog with a somewhat similar motif to yours.<br/>

Brings to mind a tsuba I sold earlier this year which looked classical Akasaka...sort of. Sasano papered it years ago to one of the Akasaka generations (when a friend owned it). Later, it ended up in a Haynes auction where Bob explained it was papered Akasaka, but it is possibly Tosa Myochin. I bought the tsuba and Bob didn't send the papers. I had to ask for them and when he gave them to me (at a show) he grumbled about the call being all wrong, that they were definitely Tosa Myochin. The tsuba did have the "wiskers" tagane marks on the seppa-dai. Always have to laugh when I recall how upset Bob was about the Sasano call.  <br/>

    Hi Ron et all, ok, I did some homework and now understand the punch <br/>
    marks you were describing, "Kakushi-tagane" and the image I provided <br/>
    is not the same as these. Any thoughts if this is a gimei piece or <br/>
    not ?, I assume if he was a lower end smith it's likely not to be <br/>
    gimei. <br/>
<br/>
    Sorry to all inmy first mail, I was reading about two schools at the <br/>
    same time and confused myself, easy for me to do. <br/>
<br/>
    Yes the Tosa Myochin are late Edo.<br/>
<br/>
    Jim, what is the Haynes/Wakayama book you are referencing ?.<br/>
<br/>
    Cary, do you have an image of the tsuba you had at the show or did it <br/>
    sell ?, Just for intrests sake.<br/>
<br/>
    best wishes<br/>
<br/>
    Rich<br/>
