<div id="ygrps-yiv-1952851261">More questions today...<br/>
<br/>
First question. I've never picked up on this before, but realized that both NAMBAN and NANBAN is used with describing these tsuba. Is there a simple explanation for this? <br/>
<br/>
Second question. What is the difference between the carving techniques, SUKIDASHI-BORI and SUKISAGE-BORI? My translated texts use the term sukisage-bori but glossaries seem to only define sukidashi-bori. I'm suspecting they describe the same technique of producing low relief by carving away the tsuba's surface metal. <br/>
<br/>
Just more confusion discovered when writing was was to be a simple, straight-forward namban tsuba article. (sigh)<br/>
<br/>
P.S. I'd like to ask Jim Gilbert a question. Jim, are you out there???<br/>

  Hi Ron,<br/>
  Really neat tsuba, I believe these are water dragons the way they are done in Hizen style, I found a couple links below:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  this one has the closest silhouette  but yours has more detail<br/>

  Pretty positive this is the right type of dragon. I'm sure your library is way superior to mine, and this will help point in the the right direction.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1602837174">Hi Gordon -<br/>
<br/>
Yes, several explanations came in that cleared this up for me, so don't <br/>
worry about trying to explain it again. Takes some explaining but also takes <br/>
time to write it out! I admire you guys who have mastered all of this <br/>
language thing!!!<br/>
<br/>
Same thing about the two carving techniques. As I thought, the one is <br/>
carving away the ground to create low relief, the other carving out the <br/>
design in what I've always heard was sunken relief...if that makes sense.<br/>
<br/>
Since you are involved with the NTHK, let me ask this. The name Namban <br/>
(Nanban, in modern terms, so I hear) is a general term. There are the <br/>
sub-catagories for those fittings. However, I've noticed that the NBTHK, <br/>
auction houses, dealers, etc. (I don't have any NTHK examples) do not get so <br/>
specific and call these things, "Namban." (Except perhaps for the most <br/>
earliest examples?) Care to comment on this thinking for all to see??? <br/>
Interesting topic!<br/>
<br/>
See you in SF?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-348587535">Hi Ron,<br/>
<br/>
It is, as Bob says, a pronunciation/spelling thing. The actual  <br/>
pronunciation is /m/, so Namban. It is very difficult to pronounce /n/  <br/>
after the initial /n/, but some sources use that as the spelling. It  <br/>
is similar to the nengo Tenbun. Some sources give Tembun. I always use  <br/>
Namban and Tenbun, but some other sources use the alternative spelling.<br/>
<br/>
The carving explanation sounds reasonable, but I think there is a fair  <br/>
degree of ambiguity over many of these terms. And, thanks for getting  <br/>
back on the kanji stuff.<br/>
