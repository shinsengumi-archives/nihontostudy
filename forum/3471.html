<h3>Tsuba Mystery</h3>
by <i>pac0datac0</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-784254374">Recently I bought a WWII Officer's Katana. I've been trying to do <br/>
research on it and I'm a little puzzled. The Tsuba has 4 or 5 <br/>
swastikas (can't remember how many exactly) carved into the Tsuba. I <br/>
found out that swastikas are buddhist symbols as well as what Hitler <br/>
used them for. There are designs of painted fish on the scabbard as <br/>
well as the handle. Which are also buddhist symbols. Has anyone else <br/>
ever seen Katanas decorated with swastikas? I was just wondering if <br/>
someone might have any background info. Any help would be great. <br/>
Please e-mail me back with any info.</div>

        Recently I bought a WWII Officer's Katana. I've been trying to do <br/>
        research on it and I'm a little puzzled. The Tsuba has 4 or 5 <br/>
        swastikas (can't remember how many exactly) carved into the Tsuba. I <br/>
        found out that swastikas are buddhist symbols as well as what Hitler <br/>
        used them for. There are designs of painted fish on the scabbard as <br/>
        well as the handle. Which are also buddhist symbols. Has anyone else <br/>
        ever seen Katanas decorated with swastikas? I was just wondering if <br/>
        someone might have any background info. Any help would be great. <br/>

about the 10,000 lives or 10,000 incarnations of<br/>
Budda? Someone with a copy of Joly want to help?<br/>
     Memory also says it showed up in Southwest<br/>

'discontinued' by the US. This last bit may be<br/>
(hystorical myth). I believe most of this is from a<br/>

<h3>Re: Tsuba Mystery</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-565523010">Thanks for all of your help. I really appreciate it. Currently, I'm <br/>
not even sure if my Katana is authentic or a fake. My wife bought it <br/>
from EBay. She, of course, didn't think that the seller could be <br/>
trying to scam her so she didn't do any reseach before buying it. I've <br/>
been doing research NOW though (unfortunately it may be too little too <br/>
late). The Hada looks like it is acid etched into the sword, giving me <br/>
the impression that it's fake, but I could be wrong. There is kanji <br/>
located on the tang but I haven't been able to translate it. It seems <br/>
as though there are no kanji characters that match the ones on the <br/>
tang. Might just be hard to find a correct match since I'm not an <br/>
expert in kanji translating. Any thoughts?</div>

<h3>Akasaka tsuba age</h3>
by <i>retalt</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1415890709">All, I have an Akasaka guard ( mumei ) I always attributed to the 6th ( <br/>
or there abouts ) Tadatoki. It has some pitting in the mimi and <br/>
recently, in better light, I noticed for the first time, unmistakable <br/>
layers in these pitted area. Clearly 3 layers are visible.<br/>
<br/>
Reading Masayuki Sasano, he talks about a famous tsuba by the shodai <br/>
Tadamasa that was burnt in a fire in the early 20th century, and how the <br/>
layers were revealed with this damage. He also mentions that if you can <br/>
see the layers with the tsuba in good condition, then it is not a great <br/>
tsuba.<br/>
<br/>
As the layers on mine are visible only in the pitting damage and no <br/>
where else on the tsuba, I was wondering if this guard maybe older than <br/>
I originally thought ?. When did the 3 layer construction finish/taper <br/>
off in Akasaka tsuba production?, was it still in the first few Tadatoki <br/>
or mostly with the first 4 masters.<br/>

( note: the pitting never looks as bad in the hand as it does in this <br/>
photo )<br/>

cheers<br/>

by <i>mvinehout</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-747718030">I couldn't find much in Joly's books, I did see on page 476; "On their white <br/>
paper sails are written the soul names (kaimyo) of the dead.  Upon their <br/>
deck is placed a small cup of fresh water, besides an incense cup and some <br/>
banners bearing the manju (svastika, fylfot), with the cross arms turning <br/>
towards the right, or sometimes, but rarely turning towards the left <br/>
(suvastika).  They are used on the Festival of the Dead (Ura bon ye)."  Also <br/>
I found this info:<br/>
The svastika is a symbol of auspiciousness (svast = auspiciousness). It has <br/>
been used as a symbol of the sun or of visnu or even of ganesa. It also <br/>
represents the world-wheel, the eternally changing world, round a fixed, <br/>
unchanging centre or god.<br/>
<br/>
Svastika marks depicted on doors or walls of buildings or an animals, are <br/>
believed to protect them from the wrath of evil spirits or furies of nature.<br/>
<br/>
I have seen this mark on old maps, marking the place of temples in Japan, so <br/>
I know the Japanese used this symbol to represent more than what I found out <br/>
tonight.  I'm sure Jim or Tom probably knows...<br/>

<h3>Re: [nihontostudy] Re: Tsuba Mystery</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-501852494">Andres and All,<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for the Field Museum link.  I've had a good trawl and was very<br/>
interested to see the tsuba by Sonobe Yoshihide in the Boone Collection.  Is<br/>
this a Shupa (day-night) tsuba??<br/>
<br/>
In the link itself as given by Andres I was particularly interested to see that<br/>
Rob Nalewajk's commentary inluded the note that shakudo was an exclusively<br/>
Japanese alloy.  I believe this is now considered not to be so.  The quote from<br/>
the link is:<br/>
<br/>
"Shakudo (literally "red copper") is a metal alloy that was invented and used<br/>
exclusively by the Japanese."<br/>
<br/>
I had also always believed shakudo to be an exclusively Japanese alloy, probably<br/>
having read it in the same quoted sources.  A friend of mine disagreed with my<br/>
thought and pointed me to an article, which I will briefly recap here for the<br/>
listeros interest (I last did this on Ichi's Nihonto list in March 1996!!).  He<br/>
gave me a copy of the article he had read and, voila, it does seem shakudo is<br/>
far from being a uniquely Japanese alloy.  The article is:<br/>
<br/>
   "Secrets of Achilles' shield", by Paul Craddock, in New Scientist, 22 January<br/>
1994, pages 32-35.<br/>
<br/>
Paul Craddock is head of metals research at the British Museum, London.  The<br/>
article gives further reading for those interested:<br/>
<br/>
   Metal Plating and Patination, edited by S. La Niece and P.T. Craddock<br/>
   (Butterworth-Heinemann, 1993).<br/>
<br/>
OK, OK, "What's it about", I hear you cry.  I hope a short quote from the<br/>
article will suffice:<br/>
<br/>
"It now turns out that some of the most prestigious metals from the ancient West<br/>
are almost identical to a sophisticated metal, known as shakudo, that is still<br/>
made in Japan.  The trail led from Egyptian hieroglyphics of 3500 years ago to<br/>
clues contained in Homer's Iliad, on to the famous and highly prized Corinthian<br/>
bronze of the Roman Empire, eastwards with more clues from the great epics of<br/>
Indian and Tibetan literature, then to the work of barely remembered Chinese<br/>
craftsmen before culminating in 19th century Japan.<br/>
<br/>
"The detective work took place at the British Museum in London, where we had<br/>
suspected that some of the processes briefly described by ancient alchemists for<br/>
making a special type of bronze with a black patina were similar to those for<br/>
making shakudo.  By a happy combination of detailed examination of metalwork,<br/>
careful study of ancient literature, some intuition and a little luck we were<br/>
able to turn promising hypotheses into fact, and build up a cultural and<br/>
technical trail stretching over half the globe through more than 3000 years."<br/>
<br/>
I found this to be fascinating reading, and I hope it is of interest to the<br/>
list.<br/>

As for the discussion on symbolism, do share if you ever find it.<br/>
There's lots of info on the net on the symbol itself, but none I've<br/>
seen related specifically to its use in tsuba.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1512580473">Fantastic find! I was blown away when I saw the picture of the tsuba. <br/>
Other than a slight variations, it basically is the same tsuba that I <br/>
have. Of course mine isn't nearly as old. Supposedly mine is from the <br/>
WW2 era. A pic of my tsuba is in "WW@ Katana Pics" in the files <br/>
section. Obviously mine is not made out of the same metal but the <br/>
basic shape is almost the same. I'd love to get that translated.</div>

<h3>rub-a-dub-dub</h3>
by <i>retalt</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-316687977">greetings all, last week I was rummaging through my tsuba collection and <br/>
pulled out a Higo ( Nishigaki ) tsuba i have had for some time. I <br/>
decided it could do with an extended vacation in the pocket, wrapped in <br/>
a nice soft cotton cloth I have. I got to thinking about what was <br/>
actually required here as I do not do this very often, just preferring <br/>
to leave well enough alone. A visit to Jim G's site and a read through <br/>
his article "Cleaning Iron Tsuba <br/>
<<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://home.earthlink.net/%7Ejggilbert/Cleaning.htm">http://home.earthlink.net/%7Ejggilbert/Cleaning.htm</a>>" was required to <br/>
see if there was anything I needed to know besides the basics.<br/>
<br/>
Reading through, I came across the following sentence, "Lots of patience <br/>
and tired fingers is the only way."<br/>
<br/>
This got me to thinking and asking the following questions.<br/>
<br/>
1. How much pressure is applied generally ?, A: only a soft touch, <br/>
lightly brushing the surface with the cloth. B: a firm touch, bring a <br/>
little pressure to the surface. C: hard pressure, rubbing like a <br/>
lunatic. The last I think would be a big no no as my main concern is <br/>
over polishing, making the tsuba shiny and this is the last thing we <br/>
want to achieve.<br/>
<br/>
2: Is there any sort of preferred cloth. ie. cotton, silk, flannel, <br/>
gingham ???? ( just joking on the flannel ). Has anyone tried all types <br/>
of cloth and had varying result.<br/>
<br/>
3: Do people use oils ?. I have heard of Choji, skin oil ( i.e forehead, <br/>
neck etc ) and gun oil add to lustre but I find this makes the tsuba <br/>
look a little artificial. Ok, to stop any active rust I understand but <br/>
if the Hira is just a little dull and neglected then.................<br/>
<br/>
Ok, so just something to generate some thought and discussion.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers all.<br/>
