<div id="ygrps-yiv-879919409">Barry Thomas sent along some information on several interesting articles he turned up in his files:<br/>
<br/>
  1.  Inscriptions on Japanese Sword Fittings,<br/>
       by Henri L. Joly.<br/>
       Japan Society: TRANSACTIONS, VOL. XV,<br/>
       pps 86 - 117 with 6 plates and a Table of kakihan.<br/>
<br/>
  2.  European Influence on Japanese Sword Fittings, 1543 - 1853<br/>
       by C.R. Boxer.<br/>
       Japan Society: TRANSACTIONS, VOL. XXVIII,<br/>
       pps 151 - 178 with 15 plates.<br/>
<br/>
  3.  The Sword Ornaments of the Goto Shirobei Family,<br/>
       by Alexander G. Mosle, M.J.S.m Imperial Japanese ..... (Consul??).<br/>
       Japan Society: TRANSACTIONS, VOL. VIII,<br/>
       pps 188 - 208 with a few plates and figures AND a genealogical<br/>
       table of the pupils of the Goto Shirobei Family.<br/>
<br/>
Have any of these appeared in print recently?  Seems like a worthwhile project to make them available on line (Barry's idea).<br/>

I'm not aware of any of these being published anywhere<br/>
recently. It would be nice to read/see the articles, but<br/>
it would IMHO be a huge task to code them all for the<br/>
web. Not to mention the webspace and download bandwidth<br/>
needed.<br/>

If Barry is willing to send me copies of these articles I can have them<br/>
reprinted in the JSSUS newsletter.  There is no copyright issue because of<br/>
their age.<br/>
 <br/>
I don't have his e-mail so I am sending this message to you.<br/>

Thanks - probably much easier than making them into web documents.  Barry is on the list, so we'll see what he wants to do.  <br/>
<br/>
I checked with Alan Harvie who has been publishing a lot of vintage material in the Northern California club newsletter to make sure that he wasn't already working on it (he isn't).  I'd certainly like to see these articles get another airing.  Barry, if I can help with it, let me know.<br/>
