<h3>stolen sword</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1006006662">Posted recently to another list, please let us know if you encounter <br/>
this sword.<br/>
-t<br/>
<br/>
It is embarrassing for me to tell you that I have lost a valuable sword.<br/>
It was sent Global Express Mail .  It was routed to Mexico instead of to<br/>
Tokyo, according to EMS in San Francisco. We are still awaiting response<br/>
from Mexico but it should be shortly.<br/>
In the meantime if this has been lost or stolen someone may attempt to have<br/>
it valued or try to sell it at the S.F. Taikai.<br/>
If approached please alert security.  I will be there with full description<br/>
and oshigata and photo.<br/>
Shinsakuto signed: Musashi no Kuni ju Kato Chozaemon Sanehira saku<br/>
Dated: Showa 47, Feb. (1972)<br/>
28.11 nagasa, width 1.38in  .79 sori<br/>
horimono: Bohi on both sides<br/>
Full polish<br/>
In shirasaya, The saya is in an unusual  white cloth bag with tie string.<br/>
It was appraised at 480,000 yen or now something over $4000. dollars.<br/>
Your help would be most appreciated.<br/>
<br/>
sincerely<br/>
