<h3>The Last Samurai</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1419663688">Fellow List Members,<br/>
<br/>
I'm not sure how many of you have gotten the chance to<br/>
see "The Last Samurai" yet as I'm not sure when it<br/>
comes out stateside and elsewhere. I went last night<br/>
to see it with my wife. I've got to say that I was<br/>
extremely well done in my humble opinion. I can see<br/>
this movie propelling a lot of new students into Kendo<br/>
dojo�s as well as the other areas of martial arts. The<br/>
same will probably happen to the sword collecting<br/>
community as well. So if changes are to be made to<br/>
attract new members to the sword groups I would<br/>
suggest that NOW would be the time to update your<br/>
sites with new information for the newer crowd. Forget<br/>
the market surveys and polling (no offence Pat) but<br/>
you won�t need them. Within the next month and a half<br/>
to two months I would imagine that anyone with a<br/>
website that is Japanese Sword or Samurai related is<br/>
going to be getting a lot of traffic and email with<br/>
questions. Rich S your site is going to be running way<br/>
over it�s bandwidth I�m sure. It will probably happen<br/>
again when this movie makes the jump to DVD/VHS and<br/>
the rest who haddn�t seen it in theaters see it at<br/>
home. I don�t want to give away any of the story as<br/>
it�s a movie that you have to see for yourself. But I<br/>
would suggest seeing it if nothing else than for the<br/>
final battle scene. Enjoy!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1652495372">Hi Lou, sorry, poor choice of words on my behalf, I see an older copy as being a reproduction of the original, thus it is a repo in a sense. this of course gets confused with repo's as in modern/present day items. No, I think it looks like it may be from around the late edo era/early meiji era, but not the original.<br/>
