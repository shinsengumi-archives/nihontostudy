<h3>Thin Tsurumaru Tsuba</h3>
by <i>leonkim</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1775556122">Gentlemen,<br/>
<br/>
I'd like to get any advice for this crane tsuba. It has chocolate <br/>
color (very smooth surface and slightly dark red) and size is big, 9.1 <br/>
cm X 8.8 cm but quite thin, only 3.0mm thickness. <br/>

A tsuba of very similar design is shown on page 3<br/>
of Hawley's Tsubas in Southern California. It is<br/>
signed Bushu something (the mei is legible, just<br/>
I can't read it all). Perhaps someone with better<br/>
Kanji skills than I (that's almost everyone :-)<br/>
who has the book can translate the rest for you.<br/>

<h3>factory plate</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1841093106">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
I have recently acquired Haynes catalog #1 and was<br/>
reading the very nice intro as well as tsuba<br/>

 Any history would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks.<br/>

<h3>katana vs wakizashi</h3>
by <i>kdw21620</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1892468333">Sorry had 1 more question from a previous thread.  How<br/>
is it determined when a tsuba is for a katana or for a<br/>
wakizashi?  Is it soley based on the presence or lack<br/>
of a kogai/kozuka ana?  How are they viewed when the<br/>
ana's are filled in?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.<br/>

Presence of kogai and kozuka ana are maybe part of the<br/>
story. I asked Jim a similar question and as I understood<br/>
his reply (perhaps he will elaborate); katana tsuba<br/>
normally have both kozuka and kogai ana or either<br/>
while wakizashi tsuba normally only have a kozuka ana.<br/>
Although there are numerous exceptions; small sukashi<br/>
tsuba which to my eye are obviously for a wakizashi<br/>
based on size not uncommonly have both. Also many<br/>
of the very early tosho and katchushi tsuba had<br/>
only one (many had been added later). I hope I haven't<br/>
done too much damage to what Jim had said. I'm sure<br/>
he will fill in the blanks.<br/>

<h3>Re: [nihontostudy] Re: katana vs wakizashi</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1333840313">Hi,<br/>
Just time for a partial answer.  From early koshirae I have seen, katana are mounted with kogai only, kozuka and kogai, or neither.  I have not seen a katana mounted with only a kozuka.<br/>
<br/>
Wakizashi are very commonly mounted with only a kozuka, but are also seen with kozuka and kogai.<br/>
<br/>
The two files in the nihontostudy website File section include columns to indicate the kozuka and kogai configuration for each mounting in the Katana Koshirae catalog.<br/>
<br/>
We see a fair number of 8+ cm tsuba around with a kozuka ana cut in them...  were they really big wakizashi tsuba, were katana mounted with kozuka only at some point or was the ana used for a kogai, despite the kozuka shape?  I don't know.  There is one wakizashi koshirae in the spread sheet with an 8.6 cm tsuba, so that might be the explanation.<br/>
<br/>
I'll come back to this later.<br/>

I don't think that the article on iron plate is on my site, just on Rich's.  It might be buried in my Q&A page text.<br/>
<br/>
I have seen a couple of copper or brass plates that appeared to be folded, but I think that's pretty unusual (and I'm not even sure about those).  I think that the earlier ones were just hammered out into a plate without folding.  Both earlier and later pieces were cast to shape.  Metallurgists can identify casting vs. hammering vs. a combination of the two in copper alloy artifacts by microscopic examination of cross sections.  I'm not aware of any reliable way to tell from just looking at the finished piece.<br/>

Could it be that we're seeing the double ana katana tsuba/single<br/>

that the others are for battle mounts or perhaps earlier<br/>

FWIW, the data in my spreadsheet and the dat file that Rich made from it comes from ca. late Muromachi to early Edo period mounts.<br/>
<br/>
I think that katana and wakizashi with both kozuka and kogai is the more formal arrangement. <br/>
<br/>
I see the katana with neither (kozuka or kogai) as the likely battle setup, or with kogai only, depending on rank.  Kozuka only for wakizashi.  No proof for that, though.<br/>

<br/>
Could it be that a some of these "uchigatana sized" tsuba got flipped <br/>
over and the kogai ana used for kozuka ana?<br/>
<br/>
I have one piece where the side where most of the banging is around the <br/>
nakago ana would iply the hitsu ana was for a kozuka, but<br/>
from the shape the ana itself kind of looks  like it might have been for <br/>
a kogai, and there is some banging on the other side<br/>
that looks like they originally did on these pieces - check out:<br/>

<br/>
Another couple of  explanations I'd posit is that perhaps there were a <br/>
LOT more uchigatana<br/>
 that weren't katana length or that perhaps  people were turning their <br/>
uchigatana into<br/>
wakizashi via shortening when it became the rage to have a<br/>
wakizashi.  It seems that a lot of the early tachi fittings got reused <br/>
in various ways - could it be that<br/>
a lot of these pieces got "recycled" into wakizashi one way or another, <br/>
hence the large number of early tsuba that have<br/>
the kozuka ana?.<br/>

<br/>
Looks like a kozuka-ana to me. The shape of the ana would be more indicative<br/>
of a kogai rather than the size. Some early stuff with what can be taken as<br/>
ubu-ana can be either very large or very small. Ko-Mino kogai come in a wild<br/>
variety of sizes including pencil thin ones.<br/>

  Hi,<br/>
<br/>
  Could it be that a some of these "uchigatana sized" tsuba got flipped<br/>
  over and the kogai ana used for kozuka ana?<br/>
<br/>
  I have one piece where the side where most of the banging is around the<br/>
  nakago ana would iply the hitsu ana was for a kozuka, but<br/>
  from the shape the ana itself kind of looks  like it might have been for<br/>
  a kogai, and there is some banging on the other side<br/>
  that looks like they originally did on these pieces - check out:<br/>

  Another couple of  explanations I'd posit is that perhaps there were a<br/>
  LOT more uchigatana<br/>
  that weren't katana length or that perhaps  people were turning their<br/>
  uchigatana into<br/>
  wakizashi via shortening when it became the rage to have a<br/>
  wakizashi.  It seems that a lot of the early tachi fittings got reused<br/>
  in various ways - could it be that<br/>
  a lot of these pieces got "recycled" into wakizashi one way or another,<br/>
  hence the large number of early tsuba that have<br/>
  the kozuka ana?.<br/>

Thanks for the input - I was thinkin' maybe that funky shape on part of <br/>
it might have started out as a kogai...<br/>
I guess I'll just have to keep looking for more pre edo fittings to <br/>
study :-)<br/>
<br/>
thx,<br/>
