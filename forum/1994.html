<h3>Tsuba Theme Question</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-429285865">Lists,<br/>
<br/>
A while back I was helping ID a tsuba for a friend.<br/>
The tsuba was large and fairly well done with what<br/>
looked like a toothy bat face on one side and either a<br/>
bow or an arrow on the other side.<br/>
<br/>
I originally thought the toothy bat face to be a<br/>
maedate representation- but I've seen it repeated on<br/>
tsuba almost always in conjuction with the bow and/or<br/>
arrow. Today I suddenly remembered, as a kid, reading<br/>
of either a Japanese or Chinese god of batlike face<br/>
that wore red armor and (possibly multiple hands)<br/>
preferred a bow of tremendous strength. Possibly a God<br/>
of Archery?<br/>
   I've been looking in what mythology books I have,<br/>
and trying to research it on the web. I know very<br/>
little about Japanese mythology, so I thought this<br/>
might be a representation of Hachiman, but have had no<br/>
luck in finding supporting evidence or images.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone able to connect the dots for me and tell me<br/>
about this theme?  --"Toothy bat face character and<br/>
related archery theme."--<br/>

Without seeing the face I might be thinking in the wrong direction, but my guess is that it's an oni or other demon which could make it a reference to Raiko, aka Minamoto Yorimitsu.  Check Joly's "Legend in Japanese Art," page 411.  In brief:<br/>
 <br/>
"Legendary warrior who is credited with the wholesale slaughter of the Ogres, Demons and Goblins with which mediaeval Japan seems to have been infested.  Raiko was sleeping one day in the autumn of 988 when a beautiful lady appeared to him in a dream.  She held a bow and arrow, and introduced herself as the daughter, Shokwa, of the famous Chinese archer Yoyuki, and said that her father had entrusted her with the secrets of archery, to be transmitted to the most worthy.  She then disappeared, leaving near him the weapons, which he found on awakening."<br/>
<br/>
Joly goes on to describe his campaigns against various monsters.<br/>
<br/>
There is also Minamoto Yoshiie who "in 1096 when his father was very sick, he cured him by frightening away, with three twangs of his bowstring, the oni, cause of his illness.  It is sometimes said that he saved the life of the Emperor in this way."  No arrow involved in that story, but another possibility.  No doubt there are other stories that could fit. <br/>

your description fits the Chinese god of Archery, Chih-Chiang Fyu-ya.  <br/>
Unfortunately my books on Chinese mythology are boxed, or I could give <br/>
you more detail.<br/>
