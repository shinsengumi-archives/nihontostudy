<h3>Bridge of Dreams book sale extended</h3>
by <i>musashibobenkei</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1608527680">Thanks to all of you who took the opportunity to expand their<br/>
libraries. As the saying goes, good reference books don't cost, they<br/>
pay.<br/>
<br/>
I've decided to extend my sale through next Wednesday. I was out of<br/>
town on three separate short trips last week to tour universities with<br/>
my son, and did not get nearly as much new material uploaded as I had<br/>
planned to. Once again, it's a 33% discount on all sales of books from<br/>
my website, shipping at cost.<br/>
<br/>
I will be adding newly found books to the website, and continuing to<br/>
pack up for the Chicago Show, where I will offer a slightly less<br/>
attractive discount since as an Illinois business making sales in<br/>
Illinois I have to deal with a 10% sales tax.<br/>
<br/>
As long as you are comfortable with orders placed near the end of the<br/>
sale waiting until after the show to ship, order away!<br/>
<br/>
I'm very pleased with the results, and I'm glad to have made the<br/>
acquaintance of many of you whom I did not know before.<br/>
