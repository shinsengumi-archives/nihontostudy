<h3>Does anyone have this Heianjo Tsuba?</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1119697308">Hi all,<br/>
Shot in the dark here, but worth a try.<br/>
A member has posted on my forum. Many years ago, Hal K. used to<br/>
frequent the sword shows. Some may remember him.<br/>
10 or more years ago he sold a Heianjo tsuba (Large round solid plate<br/>
with mixed soft metal flowers) to a guy either at the Chicago or<br/>
Florida show. In cleaning up his stuff, he has come across the papers<br/>
for that tsuba, and would love to unite them with the owner now.<br/>
So if anyone thinks they may have it, pop into<br/>

see if you can get your origami 10 years later :-)<br/>
