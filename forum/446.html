<div id="ygrps-yiv-1959354903">hey guys. i just joined but i have been collecting Japanese swords <br/>
for some time now. well the other day at the flee market i found this <br/>
GREAT KATANA. it only cost $500 and i could date it back to the 1844 <br/>
from the markings on it. i was woundering if anyone could help me <br/>
price it. i'll have the pictures on the photos page under great <br/>
finds. so if anyone has a number for me or could help me find one <br/>
then i would like it very much.<br/>
<br/>
peace,<br/>
