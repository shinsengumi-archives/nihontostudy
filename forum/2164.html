<br/>
Te sales of Asian art are about to begin in New York, with previews<br/>
this weekend of Chinese, Japanese and Korean works at Sotheby's and<br/>
Christie's.<br/>
<br/>
Christie's auction of Japanese art on Wednesday has two highlights<br/>
worth seeing during the viewings. One is a pair of 17th-century<br/>
Japanese six-panel screens that depict the Portuguese on their ships<br/>
as they are approaching Japan. The Japanese found the foreigners<br/>
strange; they are depicted with red hair, bulging eyes and huge<br/>
noses. This cross-cultural art, known as Namban in Japan, is always<br/>
worth a look, if only to see how Westerners were viewed when first<br/>
encountered.<br/>
<br/>
Christie's is also selling an entire set of Noh theater masks and<br/>
robes from an Edo-period (1615-1868) collection. They belonged to a<br/>
lord from Yamanouchi Province. Any would-be producers could pick up<br/>
enough masks and costumes at this sale to supply an entire Noh<br/>
troupe.<br/>
<br/>
Many galleries plan exhibitions to coincide with the auctions, and<br/>
the most astonishing show of Japanese work may be the elaborate<br/>
Japanese sword fittings at Sebastian Izzard Asian Fine Art, at 17<br/>
East 76th Street in Manhattan, from Tuesday through Sept. 30. The<br/>
protectors are beaten, patinated, lacquered and adorned with golden<br/>
figures from famous Japanese war stories. The workmanship makes<br/>
Fabergé look almost amateur.<br/>
<br/>
The sword fittings are from the collection of Alexander G. Moslé, a<br/>
German businessman who worked in Japan from 1884 to 1907. As the<br/>
representative of the Gruson Company, a subsidiary of Krupp Steel,<br/>
Moslé was able to persuade the Japanese government to switch from<br/>
French to German arms just as Japan was asserting itself as a<br/>
military power. (The first Sino-Japanese War was in 1894-95 and the<br/>
Russo-Japanese War in 1904-05.)<br/>
<br/>
The arms trade made Moslé wealthy; at one point he had 2,249<br/>
Japanese swords, armor, more than 1,600 sword fittings, Japanese<br/>
paintings, prints, sculptures, ceramics, lacquer and textiles. Moslé<br/>
retired in 1907 and returned to Germany, working with scholars and<br/>
dealers to learn more about his collection. In 1909 he exhibited it<br/>
at the Königliches Kunstgewerbe Museum in Berlin. It was published<br/>
in two catalogs in 1914, which are still considered important<br/>
reference works.<br/>
<br/>
In the late 1920's, Moslé traveled to the United States to try to<br/>
sell his collection to public institutions. He did sell some prints<br/>
to the Art Institute of Chicago and some lacquers to the Freer<br/>
Gallery of Art in Washington, but, apparently, little more. He was<br/>
in the United States in 1941, when America went to war, and was<br/>
stranded here. Sometime before his death in 1949, he entered a<br/>
mental institution.<br/>
<br/>
His bank organized a sale of his Japanese works at Parke-Bernet in<br/>
New York in 1948, including the fittings in this sale. These 170<br/>
works have been in private hands since that earlier sale. They<br/>
include simple designs made of iron and ceremonial sets embellished<br/>
with gold, silver and copper. They range in price from a few<br/>
thousand to a few hundred thousand dollars apiece.<br/>
<br/>
It is not easy for Americans to appreciate the importance of swords<br/>
in pre-20th-century Japan. Beginning in feudal times, Japanese<br/>
warlords equipped their armies with razor-sharp swords and fancy<br/>
sword fittings.<br/>
<br/>
"During the Edo period, a time of peace, swords were worn as status<br/>
symbols," said Mr. Izzard, who was the head of the Japanese and<br/>
Korean art department at Christie's from 1980 to 1997. "Craft<br/>
schools specializing in sword fittings emerged, each with its own<br/>
traditions and styles."<br/>
<br/>
Samurai wore their swords in public, a symbol of class and honor. A<br/>
samurai might choose quiet, subdued fittings to wear at a high<br/>
governmental occasion or something more flamboyant for a more casual<br/>
event, much as women wear their jewels today. In 1876 the emperor<br/>
Meiji banned the wearing of swords in public as part of his<br/>
modernization campaign.<br/>
<br/>
"What were once wearable symbols of wealth, prestige or entitlement<br/>
became relics that illustrated 600 years of designs by some of the<br/>
world's finest metalworkers," Mr. Izzard said. "Collecting swords<br/>
and their fittings quickly became popular in Japan and the West. Mosl<br/>
é's tenure in Japan coincided with the wave of interest in Japanese<br/>
art among Westerners, who were intrigued by the recently opened<br/>
country and its culture."<br/>
<br/>
Japonisme swept over Europe and America, influencing artists,<br/>
furniture and textile designers and metalworkers. Mr. Moslé was in<br/>
the right place at the right time. The Metropolitan Museum of Art,<br/>
the Brooklyn Museum and the Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum all<br/>
have Japanese metalwork in their collections, some from the same<br/>
period.<br/>
<br/>
Many of Mr. Izzard's sword fittings come in beautifully lacquered<br/>
boxes that may have been commissioned by Mr. Moslé; they are works<br/>
of art in themselves. Sword fittings are ardently collected by<br/>
connoisseurs of Japanese art, so it is worth seeing Mr. Moslé's<br/>
collection before it is dispersed.<br/>
<br/>
Doyle New York will not have its Chinese porcelain auction until<br/>
Oct. 27, but from Monday through next Friday the auction house is<br/>
scheduling previews by appointment for 60 lots of Chinese blue and<br/>
white porcelain from the Kangxi period (1662-1722) from the Ralph<br/>
Spencer Collection. (Information: Andrea Blunck Frost, Doyle's Asian<br/>
art expert, 212-427-4141.)<br/>
<br/>
Mr. Spencer assembled his collection in the 1960's and 70's on trips<br/>
to London and at prominent Manhattan galleries like Chait. He was a<br/>
contemporary, and collecting rival, of<br/>
<br/>
F. Gordon Morrill, whose Chinese porcelain collection Doyle sold<br/>
last September for $12 million. (Morrill's rare Yuan dynasty pilgrim<br/>
flask, circa 1345, sold for $5.8 million, a world auction record for<br/>
a piece of Chinese porcelain.)<br/>
<br/>
The Spencer Collection, which is later in date, is expected to earn<br/>
about $300,000.<br/>
<br/>
Philadelphia Curator<br/>
<br/>
Anne d'Harnoncourt, the director of the Philadelphia Museum of Art,<br/>
has announced the appointment of David L. Barquist as curator of<br/>
American decorative arts, beginning in January. Mr. Barquist has<br/>
been acting curator of American decorative arts at the Yale<br/>
University Art Gallery, where he began his career as an intern in<br/>
1981.<br/>
<br/>
An authority on American silver, Mr. Barquist is the author of "Myer<br/>
Myers: Jewish Silversmith in Colonial New York" and "American and<br/>
English Pewter at the Yale University Art Gallery."<br/>
<br/>
"The Philadelphia collections are extraordinary, but the museum is<br/>
regionally focused," Mr. Barquist said in an interview. "In trying<br/>
to present the story of American decorative arts, there are a few<br/>
holes one would try to fill judiciously. We need a few carefully<br/>
chosen examples of works from places like Boston to play off of the<br/>
museum's collections."<br/>
