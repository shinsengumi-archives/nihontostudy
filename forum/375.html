<div id="ygrps-yiv-1490285551">Hi All,<br/>
this is a first message to the group so I am hoping I havent been beaten by technology.<br/>
having seen Carys beautifully mounted Kongo-bei katana I was wondering what the current view/ opinion of this school was. I understand that they were not particularly highly thought of 20+ years ago as they were regarded as ultra conservative and not conforming directly with one of the 5 traditions. More recently 1 was listed in Comptons 100 masterpieces and I have seen several others (well at least 1) with Juyo certification. I bought a O-suriage katana with hozon papers a couple of years ago and have to say I really like it, not least for the fact it is extremely healthy ( particularly for a blade that is between 5 and 700 years old) and a powerful blade. Originally it must have been 31+ inches long. Has the school become more widely appreciated in recent years or is it just us ultra conservative suguha fanatics that love them.<br/>
would value opinions<br/>
regards<br/>

<br/>
Nobody seems interested in answering this, so I might as well put my foot<br/>
into it. The school, as you note, is conservative, which is probably due to<br/>
their Yamato origins, another very conservative place. I read the school<br/>
name as Kongobyoe, which is the pronunciation typically heard in Japan,<br/>
although there seems to be an alternative to just about every possible<br/>
reading for a name. The blades are seen as "waki-mono" or outside the main<br/>
schools. There has long been a tendency to look down on "waki-mono" with<br/>
some exceptions. Part of the problem is that with this school and others<br/>
such as the Kanabo school, the Bungo Takada school, the Kai Mihara school,<br/>
they produced a lot of kazu-uchi, which were obviously popular because they<br/>
have been so well used -- or used up. There are many who think that this is<br/>
all these schools produced, which like all generalizations, doesn't hold<br/>
true for a small, but important body of very good work. Thus, you should<br/>
look at the individual blade for the quality it possesses and not the<br/>
"truths" distributed by opinion makers. The nice thing about Kongobyoe and<br/>
the other schools I have mentioned, is that due to these kinds of<br/>
prejudices, their prices remain affordable even in Japan. Hope this fogs the<br/>
issue up sufficiently.<br/>
