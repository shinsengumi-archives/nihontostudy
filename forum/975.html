<h3>beautiful kozuka</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1063122512">found this beautiful kozuka while web surfing<br/>
<br/>
www.japanese-art.mcmail.com/Docu/kozuka.htm <br/>
<br/>
another bit of info on kozuka - and peek into Japanese mind set of <br/>
the day [at least late Edo period, anyway] -- representation of prime <br/>
minister as a pig.<br/>
<br/>
also found translation [asserted anyway] of old meaning of kozuka as <br/>
both "knife" or "art piece".  <br/>
<br/>
to bad kogatanna was tossed.  Any examples of complete daisho, in the <br/>
original mounts out there -- i would bet the kogatana made by same <br/>
smith [or student] who made the sword.  complete set would be quite a <br/>
plum.<br/>
