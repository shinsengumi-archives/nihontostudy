While at the SF TK, U should take in the Sword Etiquette demo, put on by the <br/>
JSSUS, Sat. morning, Grey Doffin always makes the sword handling basics <br/>
informative for all, (new and old guys!),<br/>

<br/>
Welcome to the discussion group! To post photos you need to go to "photos" at the bottom of these emails and post them there, then direct everyone to your "file" once you open a file. Any photos sent as attachments will not make it through, as attachements are deleted. <br/>
<br/>
Always interesting to hear how these swords came into the hands of today's caretakers. It sounds as if what your father brought home might be more than just mass produced "weapons," being mounted as you described. Do you know how to remove the handles to look for any maker's signature? I'm sure somebody here will instruct you on a few "care" pointers, etc. <br/>
