<div id="ygrps-yiv-1379832031">Good day to all.  I was looking at a Bizen Suruga tsuba and reading up <br/>
on the school in comparison to Bizen Shoami when it occured to me that <br/>
the placement of the kuchi beni (sekigane) by the tsubako as part of <br/>
the design may have been a purposeful endeavor to reduce wear to the <br/>
nakago or possible shock-related fracture to the tsuba as well as for <br/>
the fitting of the blade.  It just hit me that the use of a more <br/>
plastic metal would result in a two-fold benefit of helping to prevent <br/>
these named problems and also in fascilitating the fitting and later <br/>
tightening of the tsuba to it's sword.  That this practice occured in <br/>
Bizen could make sense in that they had a long history of sword <br/>
manufacture and when the Haruta family moved to Bizen and began tsuba <br/>
fabrication (Tsuba An Aesthetic Study pg. 31)they looked for advice <br/>
from the local smiths and began placement of the copper shims on their <br/>
observations/advice.  Just a bit of conjecture but as I have seen <br/>
swords with considerable wear to the nakago from ill-fitting <br/>
(assumption) tsuba it may be a plausible assumption.  The placement at <br/>
the top and bottom would also seem to make sense as the primary axis of <br/>
shock-force delivery would occur on this plane from strike/rebound <br/>
energy and would help explain why circumfirential placement was not <br/>
utilized.  Interesting.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-969343322">Yes, very interesting. But I think cart before the horse. As the <br/>
early swordsmiths made their own tsuba with sword to hand and could <br/>
be fitted in situ the use of shims of any form would be unnecessary. <br/>
As swords are forged by a particular smith the general dimensions <br/>
would have been consistent and the nakago-ana would have been made <br/>
consistent to these dimensions. As the fabrication of tsuba became a <br/>
cottage industry, dependent on the swordsmith hence the close <br/>
proximity of them, the tsuba-ko had to fit their tsuba not knowing <br/>
what measurements they may see and the sekigane shims developed. The <br/>
effect that had on the ability to absorb shock or reduce wear would <br/>
have been a subsequent discovery. Also may I suggest that sekigane <br/>
may have been added to some tsuba later that had worn loose to <br/>
tighten the tsuka as well as adding seppa.The rattle of a loose <br/>
tsuba is extremely annoying. These are just my take on the possible <br/>
development of such. <br/>
