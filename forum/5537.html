<h3>Help with mei and date on katana</h3>
by <i>ren47</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1599864862">I just purchased a WW11 mounted katana from a WW11 bring back from a <br/>
local inheriter of sword. I have included photos listed under the name <br/>
ticoman. Has stamped signature on one side and japanese characters on <br/>
opposite side of tang. Sword is an earlier hand forge blade in old <br/>
polish, short katana size. Blade has beautiful solid hamon and full <br/>
boshi, couple of battle nicks in blade.<br/>
Any help would be greatly appreciated.<br/>

<br/>
Thanks so much for the info, what do the red painted characters on the other side mean?<br/>
Not as old as I thought but thats why I'm no expert and the clubs are such a great resource.<br/>
I have another sword that I know is old, I've been told Koto and its a cut down to wakasashi<br/>
size but I'll include photos this week.<br/>
I paid 300 for the pictured sword....too much or reasonable?<br/>

They are numbers painted on Verne. $300 is fine, you did well. B<br/>

 </span></blockquote>As was replied by another, the painted characters are numbers, likely<br/>
assembly numbers to match the sword to its fittings, which should be<br/>
marked or stamped with the equivalent number set.<br/>
