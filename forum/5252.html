<h3>Tsuba artisans:  Norisuke I and Norisuke II</h3>
by <i>neobliviscar</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1067599859">Dear Lists,<br/>
<br/>
I've been reading and researching Norisuke I &<br/>
Norisuke II for a while. There is a good bit of<br/>
information on them in Art & Sword Vol. 3, the Owari<br/>
Tsuba book, and even a book dedicated entirely to<br/>
their work and that of a few of their students.<br/>
<br/>
Question:   Has anyone ever seen a tsuba signed by<br/>
both Gen1 ('Niwa' Norisuke) and by Gen2 ('Iwata'<br/>
Norisuke)?<br/>
   I would think there would be more than a few, as<br/>
their lives overlapped a good bit.<br/>
<br/>
There are no joint signed examples in the books, so<br/>
I'm hoping someone has seen or owns a joint work.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you in advance,<br/>
<br/>

I haven't seen one illustrated or in person.  Jointly signed works are very uncommon in fittings.  Most examples that I can think of are where the plate was prepared by one person and the decoration applied by another.  <br/>
<br/>
 It'd be an interesting study to assemble a group (even photos) of jointly signed pieces of any type.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1172091870">Dear Jim,<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for the reply.<br/>
   I have a nice tsuba signed (Niwa) Norisuke on the<br/>
front and Norishige (early sig. of Iwata Norisuke) on<br/>
the back. It is a pleasant design of a pine tree. A<br/>
design I like alot.<br/>
<br/>
I was away in Connecticut for a while and did not have<br/>
access to my books. Hitting the Owari to Mikawa no<br/>
Tanko (aka the big blue Owari book), I noted a similar<br/>
one signed and dated 1851 by Norisuke the 1st. It is<br/>
usually the last one listed in any book, as I believe<br/>
it is the latest date at which he was known to have<br/>
made a tsuba.<br/>
<br/>
Given that these guys were fairly prolific:<br/>
   I expected to eventually find some other joint<br/>
works. A list member even loaned me the Norisuke book.<br/>
There are no joint works in there or any other<br/>
reference I have opened.<br/>
<br/>
To me the workmanship of the tsuba looks like that of<br/>
Iwata Norisuke. But the signature on the front is Niwa<br/>
Norisuke.<br/>
   So maybe Iwata Norisuke made it and his teacher<br/>
signed it- or a fun but much less likely possibility<br/>
(remember that these are master forgers) Iwata<br/>
Norisuke forged his teacher's signature? Unlikely, but<br/>
given the marked similarity of their signatures- fun<br/>
to imagine.<br/>
<br/>
Any recommendations who would be best in Japan to ask<br/>
about this tsuba?<br/>

I bid on a joint work by the two Norisuke about a year ago, I didn't get it. It was virtually identical to the tsuba on page 32 of the Owari book.<br/>
