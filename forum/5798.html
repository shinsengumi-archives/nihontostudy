<div id="ygrps-yiv-32387228">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
I just wanted to give a heads up to those coming over for the Dai- <br/>
Tôken-Ichi at the end of the month. This year marks the 100th  <br/>
anniversary of the founding of the NTHK.  We will be holding the  <br/>
following event not far from the site of the DTI: The event is on  <br/>
Sunday, the 31st of October at the ANA Intercontinental Tokyo Hotel  <br/>
near Roppongi Itchôme station on the Namboku line; however, it should  <br/>
be a short taxi ride from the DTI. There will be a display of  <br/>
important swords from 2 until 4 and a dinner party from 4 until 6. The  <br/>
display is ¥5,000 and the dinner is also ¥5,000. We will also be  <br/>
giving everyone a copy of the first volume of the Yûshûtô Zuroku. If I  <br/>
know how many of you will be coming, I will try to toss in the  <br/>
translation. I hope some of you can make this. It should be fun. I  <br/>
will be at the DTI in the morning and anyone who wants to go can grab  <br/>
me and I will arrange transportation.<br/>
