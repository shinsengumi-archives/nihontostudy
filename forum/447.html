first upload includes 8 koto, 4 shinto and 2 shinshinto. Have a look <br/>
at it. Nagayama sensei is drawing oshigata energetically and I will <br/>
add them in due order.<br/>

Any idea of how the oshigata are actually drawn?  Looks like mottled gray paper, the usual ink cake for the outline... opaque white pigment (gouache?) for the hamon?  Not sure how the hada is drawn in other than by lots of sharp pencil work.  Interesting way of representing utsuri and antai.  Reality can be marked on paper in many different ways.  I wonder if Nagayama-sensei's methods will catch on.  Certainly different.<br/>

	We should be asking Mishina Sensei of course. If you look at <br/>
the Kantei Dokuhon (connoiseurs') you'll see the same style. I <br/>
believe it was Cary who pointed it out to me first, but his oshigata <br/>
are like negatives with black and white reversed. Usually the ji is <br/>
presented as white and the hamon is pencilled-in in black. This way <br/>
is "reversed" but also better approximates what the eye sees...<br/>

I bet it would be interesting to see oshigata presented side-by-side of the very same sword, using Nagayama's method (which apparently illustrates details in a very graphic way) and the traditional (realist) method.  One method "draws in" the detail that should be noted while the other method gives a very "true" illustration of the hamon, leaving finding and understanding the subtle "detail" up to the viewer...something like that, anyway.<br/>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1578663356">Nagayama sensei has a few oshigata like this in his book, and it helped<br/>
me notice some things in the second sword that I bought a couple years<br/>
ago that I would have missed otherwise. For a beginner, his oshigata<br/>
makes it absolutely clear what you are looking at and what you should be<br/>
looking for. A standard oshigata is also a good thing, but I think it is<br/>
more appropriate for well trained eyes who know what they are looking<br/>
at, and also know from experience what it would look like if they had<br/>
that particular sword in hand.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, having Nagayama sensei's oshigata coming up makes a good online<br/>
reference for smiths. It sounds like there may be more coming, and if<br/>
so, it's going to become a great quick reference guide.<br/>

I doubt that these  images start as presentations of specific swords. They<br/>
look for like summary interpretations of what ALL the swords in the<br/>
category should look - and 'feel'  - like. Plus they do not appear to use<br/>
techniques of traditional Japanese graphics. A side-by-side comparison of a<br/>
picture and a sword would be wonderful, but I'd really like to see one of<br/>
these pictures being made. It is almost as if they are drawn from memory<br/>
based on a deeper understanding that a single sword could convey.<br/>
They sure are wonderful<br/>

	I'll be corrected if I am wrong, but I am almost certain that <br/>
what you are seeing on the website are specific oshigata of <br/>
individual swords. In the Dokuhon, the oshigata especially for the <br/>
general characteristics of individual schools, the images are <br/>
"idealized" like in Teiryo Yoji. Sometimes I have found those to be <br/>
"not quite" what I am seeing in a sword. Takes some imagination to <br/>
reconcile what the book shows and what you see in hand. It is still <br/>
the best book for kantei.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-604394049">Nope, looking at the same thing. I made a mistake. Still, you would think it<br/>
would include an oshigata of the signture for the signed pieces. I think it<br/>
is a bit ambiguous.<br/>

    1) mumei Shizu Kaneuji, ha-watari 66.7 cm., sori 1.22 cm.<br/>
<br/>
    2) mei Tegai Kanenaga, ha-watari  67.0 cm.,  sori 1.7 cm<br/>
<br/>
    3) Mumei but attributed to "Chikakage" by Hon-ami Kochu (Kin-zogan-mei),<br/>
Ha-watari - 70.9 cm. / Sori : 2.6 cm.<br/>
<br/>
    etc...<br/>
  Even the Kanabo has a length and sori specified.  Not sure if we're<br/>
looking at the same links:<br/>

  I can't comment on the merit of the remarks made under the Kanabo piece.<br/>
Your territory for sure.<br/>

    Hi Jim and all,<br/>
<br/>
    I did not take a look at these until just now. I think that these are<br/>
hybred<br/>
    oshigata as only width and curvature is given, but not a specific length<br/>
for<br/>
    the blade. Also note in regard to the Kanabo information, no Yamato-den<br/>
    style workmanship has been seen is false. I have a ko-wakizashi signed<br/>
Nanto<br/>
    ju Kanabo Hayatonosho Masazane on the omote and kore wo Hosho utsusu<br/>
(this<br/>
    is a Hosho copy) on the ura. The nakago has a ichimon style nakagojiri<br/>
with<br/>
    higaki yasuri like Hosho works and the jigane is masame with a narrow<br/>
suguha<br/>
    temper and nijuba, all typical of the Hosho school of the Yamato-den.<br/>
    Remember, never say never.<br/>
<br/>
