Well now I have seen everything. Just got done<br/>
watching a Japanese sword take 7 hits from a Browning<br/>
M-2 .50 cal machine gun firing FMJ (Full Metal Jacket)<br/>
rounds. I have to give the blade its dues it took 7<br/>
hits prior to snapping off. This from the same show<br/>
that fired at a sword with what I believe was a .44<br/>
Magnum could be wrong it was a while back. Just wanted<br/>
to let everyone know to keep an eye out for the clip.<br/>
Interesting to see the blade slice through the rounds<br/>
although the copper jacket did a number on the blade<br/>
taking a chunk of the Ha with each hit until finally<br/>
the blade just failed. <br/>
