<h3>KATANA, KANESADA</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-325769924">Gentlefolk,<br/>
 <br/>
I have gathered some data from some of our forum mumbers over the <br/>
past week or so. I just found this study group and joined up and <br/>
while I am sure that everyone who was kind enough to already help me <br/>
belongs to this group I was hoping that perhaps some additional <br/>
input might be derived from within this membership.  <br/>
<br/>
I have put together a small group of pictures of a sword that I <br/>
frankly am unqualified to provide an opinion or an valuation of.  <br/>
The mune is about 1/4" wide for about 7' then tapers down to about <br/>
1/8th". The shinogi in the tapered area appears to be wider than <br/>
that however. I would appreciate any information one could possibly <br/>
provide to me.<br/>
Regards<br/>
Tom</div>
