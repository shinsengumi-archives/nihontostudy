<h3>mitokoromono</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1776851585">Hi all - <br/>
<br/>
Looking at the beautiful mitokoro mono presently being offered by Bushido, it struck me that all (or almost all) of these sets have been, what appears, "put together" and were not made "as a set" by one artist. Never really thought about this too much before but I've always thought for something to be considered mitokoro mono that they would have had to been made by one artist, as a set. Certainly these sets of kodogu come with impressive provenance but it did kind of surprise me to notice this about these sets. It would be interesting to see what the thinking is today (in the past) regarding mitokoro mono. Can a person "assemble" like fittings and call them mitokoro mono and if so, is this practice accepted out there in the market place? Maybe comparing "values" will reflect (explain) the difference between "put together" (if this is a correct term) mitokoro mono and those made by one artist "as a set." Comments anyone?<br/>

They're certainly not "authoritative", but Sotheby's<br/>
usually notes sets as "associated" mitokoromono or<br/>
some such wording. I would tend to agree with you<br/>
that "true" mitokoromono would be made at the same<br/>
time by the same artist. Just my humble $0.02 worth.<br/>
