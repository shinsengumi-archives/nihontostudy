<h3>Tsubas made of iron meteorite? May be.</h3>
by <i>sosidore</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-255657537">Dear all,<br/>
<br/>
In Chinese documented 4000 years of history meteorite have long been <br/>
regarded as precious materials. Ancient Chinese craftsmen processed <br/>
stone meteorites into varieties of item for religious worshipping <br/>
purposes. I guess iron meteorites were also used for same purposes. <br/>
Only they weathered away in time sooner than their stonny counter part. <br/>
I posted once again 2 iron tsubas onto my folder entitled SOSIDORE. <br/>
This time they revealed cleared gilded finish. <br/>
I suspeceted they were made of iron meteorite based on following <br/>
reasons.<br/>
<br/>
1. They are lighter than iron.<br/>
Iron meteorites are rarely pure iron. They usually contain nickel. Some <br/>
meteorites contain plenty of iron. They are heavy in weight and <br/>
weathered away much sooner. Some iron meteorites contain plenty of <br/>
nickel. They are apparently lighter and can better resist weather. The <br/>
two iron tsubas showed here are relatively light. They showed <br/>
superficial rusting only, evidencing higher content of nickel. Initial <br/>
observations support the idea that they might be once a part of an iron <br/>
meteorite with considerable content of nickel.<br/>
The chiseled holes revealed a secret about the distribution of <br/>
materials within tsubas are not even. Again it points to a possibility <br/>
that the tsuba materials could have been iron-nickel alloy with content <br/>
of which not evenly distributed. And this is characteristics quite <br/>
common in case of meteorite.<br/>
<br/>
I purchased these two iron tsubas from a Chinese vendor who used to <br/>
sell antiques. There is strong possibility these twp artifacts were <br/>
unearthed in China.<br/>
<br/>
They way these 2 iron tsubas gilded was typical Chinese. However, I am <br/>
pretty sure that in Japan mirror craftsman followed exactly same method <br/>
in treating mirror surface with mercury. The same technique can come <br/>
out with gilded finish when adding gold-grains into the mixture of <br/>
rubbed-on materials. <br/>
<br/>
Now, I am wondering if these two iron tsubas were of Japanese origin.<br/>
<br/>
The most convincing clues of all are the inscriptions. <br/>
1. Chinese way of arranging characters always comes from top down and <br/>
from left to right. In this case. They are to be read from top down <br/>
then left to right.<br/>
2. The content of inscriptions are typical Japanese.<br/>
3. The style of fonts are typically Japanese.<br/>
<br/>
The three points mentioned excluded the possibility that they were <br/>
originally made in China. Even if they were once contracted with <br/>
Chinese craftsmen made to Japanese order the font of characters <br/>
concerned betrayed the fact that Chinese people never trained to write <br/>
nor processed kanji onto surface of any materials in Japanese style. <br/>
Only Japanese can..  <br/>
<br/>
For sure these two iron trubas are not isolated case. I wonder where <br/>
are the rest of them and in what form? Anyone knows any record about <br/>
iron meteorite processed into any other type of items that became part <br/>
of Nihonto?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-104743731">While I cannot add any knowledge to "sosidore"'s on the subject of <br/>
meteoric iron, I cannot let his comments pass without making some of <br/>
my own.<br/>
<br/>
The two artefacts that he illustrates, with their square apertures,  <br/>
demonstrate a common enigma in deciding what use they were intended <br/>
for.  They were clearly not intended for mounting on a Japanese <br/>
sword and, for this reason cannot be considered to be 'tsuba'.  <br/>
Neither is this aperture compatible with the tang of a Chinese <br/>
sword, and my own belief is that such artefacts were intended for <br/>
mounting on a tie-jian, or Chinese 'fighting stick'.<br/>
<br/>
The question of their nickel content can surely be resolved, either <br/>
by modern physical tecniques such as laser micro-spectral or atomic <br/>
absorption spectral analysis.  Surely the effect of the forging <br/>
process would be to more evenly distribute the nickel thoughout the <br/>
base metal?  Much more simply, the simple measurement of their <br/>
density might be a guide.<br/>
<br/>
As for the use of mercuric gilding, this is clealy only practicable <br/>
on copper artefacts or on those of the soft-metal alloys containing <br/>
this element.  Before the use of this gilding tecnique on iron, the <br/>
artefact needs to be coated with a copper film, and this can <br/>
normally be seen where the gold has subsequently separated.<br/>

<h3>Re: Tsubas made of iron meteorite? May be.</h3>
by <i>sosidore</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-766001800">Thank you Dr. Lissenden for your article.<br/>
The inscriptions shown on oblong shape tsuba read "To-yo(Oriental) <br/>
Martial Sword" in English. (I guess it strongly suggested that the <br/>
iron pieces are tsubas and not anything else.)<br/>
The way To-yo combined into new Kanji phrase is unique to Japan. It <br/>
indicats that the tsuba could be dated as early as when emperor <br/>
Meiji came to power or even earlier as I would explain later. <br/>
Western metal processing technique was then not yet introduced into <br/>
Japan. This probably explains why the quality of workmanship appears <br/>
to be out dated. <br/>
Meteorite of all kind have their own earth age respectively <br/>
measurable counting from the day they reached the globe. <br/>
I hope someday some scientists would be interested enough in doing <br/>
the dating for this tsuba.<br/>
Once determined of its age people could better tell its background <br/>
by linking its age with history of Sino-Japanese cultural enchange. <br/>
Tsuba or any other name one might have it called I am sure it must <br/>
have been a part of one very unusual martial sword exactly as the <br/>
inscription illustrated. <br/>
The owner of which could be rather important so qualifiable to claim <br/>
the ownership of the rare iron meteorite. Who is this man? I wonder. <br/>
By inscripting tsuba with "TO-YO(oriental) MARTIAL SWORD" The sword <br/>
must have been made with an western reciepient in mind. Again an <br/>
important figure. Who is this western man?<br/>
Here comes one interesting question. Why the Japanese craftman did <br/>
not inscribe the said tsuba straight forwardly with "Japanese <br/>
martial sword"?<br/>
Please note that during Chinese Ming dynasty, which is earlier than <br/>
Meiji period, Japan shipped a lot of porcelain art to Europe bearing <br/>
mostly Chinese designs. And remarkable portioned of them marked with <br/>
Chinese way of dating. <br/>
(This was happened when China sealed its seaport to contain its own <br/>
people within.) <br/>
Japanese porcelain exporters were aiming to impress European buyers <br/>
that the porcelain they shipped were of China origin. For in <br/>
European's mind then whatever oriental was mysteriously Chinese. <br/>
Somewhere in Japan long ago there might have been a recorded <br/>
meteoric fall. An iron meteor broke into many pieces before falling. <br/>
There in the local museum some specimen could still be found. What <br/>
if this tsuba happens to contain exactly same content as the <br/>
exsisting ones? <br/>
Should that be the case I would be happy to laon my tsuba to that <br/>
Japanese museum for the sake of happy reunion -- after many <br/>
centuries of roaming.<br/>
