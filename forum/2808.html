<h3>Tsuba dimensions</h3>
by <i>davidzincavage</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1167118635">I resolved to improve my understanding of tsuba recently, and have been poring over my small collection, taking measurements and making notes.  Does anyone know where on the rim and where near the center, the scholarly authorities were in the habit of taking their measurements?  I find that I can get pretty distinct differences in different regions of rim and seppa dai.  <br/>

I'm not aware of accepted standard measuring points.  FWIW, if there is variability in thickness around the mimi or seppa dai I use a rough average of the measurements.  In some cases I record the min-max thickness range if there's a lot of variability.  <br/>
