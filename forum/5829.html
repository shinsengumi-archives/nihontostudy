<h3>Nagamaki</h3>
by <i>maiorian</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1424859952">Amazingly at a London auction last week I purchased what I think is a late Muromachi/Momoyama period nagamaki in its original koshirae. The heavy 32.75" blade is unsigned but inscribed �ichi� as are the yamagane fuchi, koi-guchi and one seppa, the open end of the tsuka is similarly marked in ink under the fuchi. The tsuba is 16th century Tachi-kanagushi work lacquered red and may be original to the mounting.<br/>
<br/>
The blade is too discoloured to see any details but it has ububa of 7" and the edge side of the habaki has a slot cut into it to allow for this.  <br/>
<br/>
I assume this is the first of a group of similarly mounted weapons ordered by a clan or Temple. I think that the sword has been kept in storage for a very long time as it is not for everyday use, weighing around 6lbs and is 4'7" long overall and is in mostly good condition but with worm holes in the leather bound tsuka<br/>
<br/>
I would like to know if anyone on the list has seen a similarly mounted nagamaki, the black sam� and red lacquered binding are distinctive. I would like to know where it came from.<br/>

<h3>Nagamaki</h3>
by <i>maiorian</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1179760176">Members of the list have rightly been sceptical of my find as it is almost unheard of in the West, if I had not seen it myself I would not have believed it either. I have seen many swords with Muromachi/Momoyama style koshirae over the years, but 99.9% have been 19th c. swords in retro style. Two exceptions come to mind: Victor Harris and I catalogued the blades in the Museum of Japanese Sword Fittings in Tokyo for Christie�s in �05. In that collection was a Momoyama tachi koshirae that was later sold in NY, the other was an itomaki tachi made for an Ikeda Daimyo in Christie�s London. Victor has seen this nagamaki and agrees that it is 16th c.  <br/>
<br/>
I think this weapon is the first of a number of identical contract pieces for an armoury, as it is numbered �1' as are one seppa, the fuchi and the tsuka in ink under the fuchi, it is utilitarian, with thin yamagane mounts and low quality lacquer, the nakago-ana are not well made. The long ububa can be accounted for by its lack of use, it may have been polished only once or twice then stored for a very long time, this would account for its fairly good condition apart from the leather tsuka binding shrinking and being attacked by insects.<br/>
<br/>
It may look like a sword but it has the thick saya of a polearm, no kurikata and the tsuka is 21.5" long. <br/>
<br/>
As I stated in my earlier post it weighs around 6lbs, this is not something one would want as a personal weapon, it is too heavy and awkward to carry and I think would only be useful in battle.<br/>

	Would still like to see photos inside the opening of that saya  <br/>
(koiguchi) along with close-ups of the wood of the tsuka under the  <br/>
fuchi and the nakago. Not arguing with you just interested in your new  <br/>
acquisition. Nice tsuba BTW.<br/>
