<h3>Swords tsuba and books for sale for estate</h3>
by <i>jswords03</i>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1313183268">Dear All<br/>
<br/>
<>This is just a note letting you know that I have a group of swords, <br/>
fittings, a tachi stand, and books for sale.  Some of you might have <br/>
meet Dr. Louis Belschner a Dentist from Denver Colorado in the last few <br/>
years at one of the sword shows as he was selling off his collection.  <> <br/>
<br/>
Dr. Belschner passed away late last year and the family has ask me to <br/>
sell his remaining swords, tsuba and books. <> <br/>
<br/>
Dr. Belschner was a good friend and I always had a good time when I <br/>
visited him in Denver. Over the last 25 years I have bought a number of <br/>
blades from him and he bought a number of blades from me.  One of the <br/>
first blades I bought from him was a nice shin-shinto with dragon <br/>
horimono.  At the time he wanted $500 cash for the blade.  And I sure <br/>
wanted that blade.  I had to call my wife and talk her into wiring me <br/>
the cash as I did not have that amount.  It took all day but I walked <br/>
away with the blade very happy.  The blade was in good polish to my very <br/>
beginning eyes but I could not understand why there were dips in the <br/>
blade between the large gunome.  Turns out that he had used his dental <br/>
tools to clean up the blade and the softer metal above the hamon was <br/>
removed faster than the hardened edge.  I wonder what happened to that <br/>
blade after I sold it? <> <br/>
<br/>
If you would like a list of items that I have to sell please email me at <br/>
