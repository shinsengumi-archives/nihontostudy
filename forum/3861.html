<h3>Kantei setsumei</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1877761118">The scan of the front of the guard does not do it justice, but is sufficient to see what's there.  The photos of the mimi give some sense of the tekkotsu that place the guard in the Owari region.  Given the shape of the rim and the design, the two most likely choices are Kanayama and Owari sukashi.  I think either answer is acceptable given that you are working from pictures.<br/>
<br/>
The thickness and somewhat squared rim lean toward Kanayama, but can also be seen in Owari work.  The guard is on the thick end of the spectrum for either type.  The diameter is possible for either group, although on the large side for Kanayama.  The style of the tekkotsu is the most important point.  Kanayama tekkotsu tend to form pronounced, sometimes rough bumps.  Owari tekkotsu are low, smooth and emerge from the plate with more subtlety, forming "bean" shaped and "rope" forms.  This guard shows both of these latter types.  Also, Kanayama guards will often show some tekkotsu on the face, but Owari guards do not.<br/>
<br/>
Wild goose designs are common in Owari work.  It's not impossible to imagine a design like this in a Kanayama guard, but it is more naturalistic, complicated and even a little delicate for that group.  The majority of the evidence points toward Owari sukashi.<br/>
<br/>
The guard is in very good condition, so it may look younger than it is.  The quality of the iron and the tekkotsu are unlikely to date to the early Edo period, and are consistent with pieces from mid to late Muromachi.  The birds at the top and bottom of the sukashi design seem too free spirited to be from that time, though and seem more like Momoyama.  Given that design is easier to manipulate than iron, I lean toward late Muromachi, but Momoyama is possible.<br/>
<br/>
The guard has a kanteisho to Owari from the NBTHK.  No date given.<br/>
<br/>
Yagyu is in the correct region, but the texture of the metal will be cloudy/sandy and will tend to show many linear laminations in the rim.  It is also not a Yagyu design.<br/>
<br/>
I included this tsuba in the Akasaka display at Tampa to show the likely Owari origins of the Akasaka group.  While some Ko-Akasaka guards will show tekkotsu, they are not of this type and the color and texture of the iron is different.  The rim would show a more rounded shape in Akasaka.  The cutting of the sukashi would have sharper edges.  The design does have a bit of Akasaka feeling, but there would probably be more asymmetry and abstraction in an Akasaka piece.<br/>
<br/>
That's all I can think of at the moment.  Any other observations or questions?<br/>
<br/>
Jim<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
  OK, here is a guard for kantei:<br/>

<br/>
  77.0 mm H x 74.8 mm W, 7.2 mm thick at the mimi and 7.1 mm thick at the seppa dai.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  As far as I know it has not been published, but it has been exhibited at a couple of study meetings.  So, if you've already seen it and remember the attribution, please don't post the answer to the list.  It is mumei and there are two almost equally reasonable attributions, but I think that there is more evidence for one than the other.<br/>

Thank you for the fun kantei. I refrained to participate, but I might add,<br/>
and I am pretty sure you are aware of this thinking, with Owari, tekkotsu of<br/>

Excellent, while of course I would love to handle<br/>
them,  these pictures are the next best thing.  Great<br/>
stuff and makes it clearer.  If someone had the time,<br/>
it would be great to put these up on your/someone's<br/>
website.  All these sites devoted to swords, could use<br/>
some more to tsuba.  Would love to see tekkotsu<br/>
website depicting various schools.<br/>
<br/>
Now for the next question- why so different?  metal<br/>
used? folding techniques?  when forming the mimi what<br/>
steps would they do (I know big questions)?<br/>

BRILLIANT - one picture is truly worth a thousand words, let alone five!  I<br/>
don't believe I have ever seen this in real life, so after 40 years collecting<br/>
blades and only occasionally finding tsuba I can now look out for tekkotsu<br/>
"seriously".  A couple of questions spring to mind:<br/>
<br/>
- Is tekkotsu limited to a "time window"??  That is, is it only found in certain<br/>
iron tsuba (sukashi??) from say (hahaha) 1500 to 1620??  I guess most Edo iron<br/>
tsuba don't have tekkotsu.<br/>
<br/>
- Is tekkotsu when found a "good" indicator???<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for great pics.<br/>
<br/>
Best regards,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-661579995">I am taking the liberty of posting a reply from Jim I copied awhile <br/>
back on the board about tekotsu:<br/>
<br/>
'Checking the Yagyu article in the European NBTHK "Selected Fine <br/>
Swords..." book<br/>
I found these interesting comments':<br/>
<br/>
"Masters like shodai and nidai Yamakichibei, Nobuie and Hoan of Owari <br/>
had<br/>
studied the workmanship of old Owari and Kanayama tsuba, whose iron <br/>
has the<br/>
0.6-0.8% of carbon which produces tekkotsu. Nevertheless certain <br/>
schools<br/>
demanded higher standards, among them Yagyu; the Hayashi and Shimizu <br/>
groups in<br/>
Higo; and Nobuie, Hoan and Yamakichibei of Owari; while the Katchushi <br/>
group such<br/>
as Myochin used traditional forging methods.<br/>
<br/>
"Forging to produce the jitetsu and that for tekkotsu should be <br/>
carried out<br/>
separately. Each tsuba-ko decides the proportion of tekkotsu metal to <br/>
use, for<br/>
example 1-5% of that for of jitetsu. This is cut into one centimeter <br/>
pieces,<br/>
4-5 mm thick, which are mixed with the jitetsu during forging. If the <br/>
forging<br/>
is not good enough, it can open up later when heated in the process of<br/>
tekusarakashi, which results in cracks or so called forging mistakes.<br/>
Interestingly enough most of the highly valued futoji-mei Nobuie <br/>
tsuba show<br/>
those cracks.<br/>
<br/>
The bibliography cites an article "A Brief Summary of Tekkotsu" in <br/>
Token Bijutsu<br/>
#522, July 2000, 9-11 by a tsubako named Kazunari Naruki. I'm <br/>
guessing that<br/>
this is the source for the above comments.<br/>

The tsuba is very heavy and comes with two giant size shakudo seppa ( <br/>
covering the two hitsu ana and make it into a tachi tsuba ? ), the <br/>
pics show the most prominent bones but there are others all along the <br/>
mimi (  the  thickness of the mimi is close to 0.75 cm ).<br/>
I think this is a ko-shoami tsuba.<br/>

It is a beautiful example with Juyo papers. I don't<br/>

Good, glad it helped.  I plan to update the photos on my site and will include images of rims where there is something to see.  Given storage and bandwidth limitations I will probably have to get rid of the pieces that I don't have any longer so that I can focus on the best examples.  <br/>
<br/>
The technical aspects of tekkotsu are far from settled.  The quote that Pete posted from the Solingen catalog is an interesting one.  I don't know whether that is how tekkotsu were formed in the Muromachi period.  I have read hypotheses crediting everything from the source of the ore onward for being the cause of tekkotsu.  There is even an idea that the bones were not even visible in the original piece but are only revealed over time due to the corrosion and/or wear resistance of the higher carbon regions.  I doubt that that's entirely true, but it is a factor for guards with condition problems -- the tekkotsu will stand out.<br/>

  Excellent, while of course I would love to handle<br/>

  stuff and makes it clearer.  If someone had the time,<br/>
  it would be great to put these up on your/someone's<br/>
  website.  All these sites devoted to swords, could use<br/>
  some more to tsuba.  Would love to see tekkotsu<br/>
  website depicting various schools.<br/>
<br/>
  Now for the next question- why so different?  metal<br/>
  used? folding techniques?  when forming the mimi what<br/>
  steps would they do (I know big questions)?<br/>

If there is very bad rust pitting, it's possible that you will be left with substantial holes after removing the rust.  This guard though is in good condition and it's very doubtful that there would have been extreme rust in only a few spots on the rim.<br/>
<br/>
That said, tekkotsu are generally more rust resistant than the surrounding iron, so in the case of a very rusty guard the tekkotsu may become pronounced.  I don't know if that is what you've experienced.<br/>

I always thought that with photography where it is<br/>
today, a great beginner book would be on tekketsu<br/>
and/or iron of tsuba.  Also maybe there is another<br/>
place to host pictures like RichT? (Isn't that nice of<br/>
me to volunteer Rich's site).  The only reason I say<br/>
this is just like there are sites where you can look<br/>
up the pattern of steel for sword to kantei, why<br/>
couldn't we do the same with the pics of tsuba just as<br/>
you have done.  I know not all tsuba have them, but<br/>
still would help peg down school.  SO many projects<br/>
out there.  Anyway, thanks again.<br/>

The digital image only show the most prominent ones but close by are <br/>

Nice tekkotsu, consistent with Ko-Shoami.  The surface working and the nunome zogan are also fit Ko-Shoami.  The condition looks fine.  The addition of o-seppa is certainly interesting.  I've seen this guard before somewhere along the line.<br/>

This seems to have started when Yahoo changed the photo file structure from folders to albums.  The global privilege settings have not changed, so you're supposed to be able to post photos.  Here's something to try -- create a new album and try to put your photos in there.  I'm guessing that the problem may be happening when you try to update an old folder that has been converted to the new format.<br/>
<br/>
I haven't had a problem putting photos in newly created albums, but haven't tried uploading anything to an old one.  Rich also has moderator privileges on this list, so he should be able to do whatever I can, other than delete the whole thing.<br/>

I would have posted photos sooner if I had known.  In general, yes, tekkotsu are a good thing, at least for Owari region work.  I can't think of a case where it would indicate poor quality.  It's part of what separates the better Owari, Kanayama, etc., work from the routine products.<br/>
<br/>
The mid to late Muromachi period is prime time for tekkotsu and they continue to a lesser degree in Momoyama.  Early Edo period Yagyu, Ono and sometimes Akasaka will also show them, although not in quite the same way as Muromachi period Owari sukashi or Kanayama.  In general they are not seen in Edo period work.  Norisuke and other late Edo copies of Yamakichibei, Kanayama, Nobuie, etc., will show tekkotsu, but they generally look forced and artificial, often oversized and overdone.  Of course sometimes maybe they got it right too, and we're still being fooled by those pieces.<br/>
<br/>
Occasionally Edo period Shoami work will be carved to simulate tekkotsu and other features of earlier-period smiting.<br/>

<br/>
  BRILLIANT - one picture is truly worth a thousand words, let alone five!  I<br/>
  don't believe I have ever seen this in real life, so after 40 years collecting<br/>
  blades and only occasionally finding tsuba I can now look out for tekkotsu<br/>
  "seriously".  A couple of questions spring to mind:<br/>
<br/>
  - Is tekkotsu limited to a "time window"??  That is, is it only found in certain<br/>
  iron tsuba (sukashi??) from say (hahaha) 1500 to 1620??  I guess most Edo iron<br/>
  tsuba don't have tekkotsu.<br/>
<br/>
  - Is tekkotsu when found a "good" indicator???<br/>
<br/>
  Thanks for great pics.<br/>
<br/>
  Best regards,<br/>

I tend to agree with Alan.  Looking at the front of the guard it does appear to be Edo period and indeterminate style.  I suspect that what you're seeing in the rim may be the structure of the forge welding brought out by the rust.  It's not unusual to see pronounced layering in, for example, Akasaka guards that have been badly rusted.  Seeing a sharp ridge like that would be unusual for tekkotsu.  Also tekkotsu are usually smoother, darker and more lustrous than the surrounding iron (although not always so with Kanayama).<br/>
<br/>
I do however have a Kanayama tsuba that I think is quite old that has a somewhat similar look in the rim.  I've never been able to decide how much of the appearance is due to how it was made vs. how it might have rusted.  Next time I set up to take macro photos I'll get some images of the rim for comparison.  The face of that guard also looks quite old and in Kanayama style, though.<br/>

<br/>
Hi, trying to get caught up, and probably violating the five minute<br/>
rule.  Be that as it may, let me interject two self-learned Chicken<br/>
truths about rust:<br/>
<br/>
1. It's always worse than it looks.  If there is ANY surface<br/>
discoloration (red, black, gray, even white), then there is pitting. <br/>
More a problem, of course, on blades as opposed to tsuba.  But any<br/>
rusting of any kind means more than just finger stones on blades to<br/>
correct the damage.  I have not the experience on kodogu to say<br/>
something even semi-intelligent, but suspect that if any discoloration<br/>
is removed, the surface will not be as smooth as when first made,<br/>
unless considerable nearby unrusted metal is removed as well.<br/>
<br/>
2. When there is scabby red/brown rust on blades, the pitting is kinda<br/>
bad to extremely bad, and it's difficult to impossible to tell simply<br/>
by looking which it is.  This Chicken truism comes from polishing<br/>
("Forgive me, God, for I have sinned") two Pacific Era gunto with<br/>
equivalent scabby surface rust.  Paradoxically, on the the traditional<br/>
tamahagane (no stamps) gunto, the rust pits went to China, in depth<br/>
they were as long or longer than their width.  I couldn't get out all<br/>
the pitting without grinding away over three hundred years worth of<br/>
metal, and had ot give up with about five percent of the pits<br/>
remaining.  On the non-traditional, Seki-stamped gunto (Kumemune<br/>
mentioned a while ago), though the surface rust was essentially<br/>
identical, the pits were no where near as deep, and, as it turned out,<br/>
not deeper than the waves in the crap wartime polish, and so were not<br/>
the major concern in the end.<br/>
<br/>
Bottom line, rust is either bad, or extremely bad, and it's tough to<br/>
tell between the two before getting serious.  FWIW, JMO.<br/>
