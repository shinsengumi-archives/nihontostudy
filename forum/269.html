<h3>polearm tsuba question</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2106990040">hey guys,<br/>
<br/>
Are there any other polearm lovers out there - check out this tsuba - it <br/>
supposedly came off a nagamaki:<br/>

(there are a few other closeups in the same directory, but I didn't <br/>
quite get a couple of 'em in focus - sorry about<br/>
presenting this upside down, but I really busy last night and didn't get <br/>
a chance to rotate the photos...).<br/>
<br/>
The piece is 2.885" by 2.73" by.21" thick at the rim and ~.175 in the <br/>
center.  The rim appears to be<br/>
silver, and the sukashi pieces appear to be filled with lead.<br/>
<br/>
The piece appears to be pretty old (Jim pointed out that it looked like <br/>
there were a couple of layers of lacquer<br/>
on it), and the lead makes it really heavy for a tsuba of this size.<br/>
<br/>
So, has anybody seen something like this on a "real" naginata/nagamaki <br/>
koshirae?  any attempts at kantei, observations,<br/>
etc., would be greatly appreciated.<br/>
<br/>
thanks,<br/>

<br/>
Have not seen anything like that on a nagamaki or naginata. The tsuba on the<br/>
Uesugi Kenshin pieces are yamagane and kiku shaped sukashi pieces. My<br/>
nagamaki has a rounded-square disk in yamagane -- absolutely plain.<br/>

the piece is confusing - the nakago ana definitely looks like a polearm <br/>
blade went through it, and it does seem<br/>
much bigger than most of the naginata tsuba I've seen so I'd believe it <br/>
was used on a nagamaki - the question<br/>
I can't resolve is "when" - there is some strange stuff about it - like <br/>
the carving on the surface is the same theme<br/>
on both sides, but reversed - what's on the top side on one side is on <br/>
the bottom side on the other...  and yeah,<br/>
its definitely covered with lacquer - perhaps several coats of it - but <br/>
then again,  the fukurin is definitely silver,<br/>
but maybe its thin enough that they stuck it on later (say in the <br/>
shin-shinto era when people started doing<br/>
stuff with these again) perhaps?  <br/>
<br/>
BTW, what are the approximate dimensions on that yamagahane nagamaki <br/>
tsuba?  does the beast weigh a<br/>
lot?<br/>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-646228842">The style of the carving and the two or more coats of lacquer look old to me.  It's hard to see much of the character of the plate itself.  Silver fukurin aren't common on older pieces, but this one doesn't look so new.  There are some early tachi koshirae with silver fittings.  The size and shape seem OK for mounting on a nagamaki, but I haven't seen many old nagamaki koshirae for comparison.  The namako sukashi (now filled) make me wonder if it was previously mounted on a sword, and if so that would further confuse the time period.  On the other hand I wonder if the sukashi was made with the intention of adding lead fillings to increase the mass of the guard (lead is about 1.46x as dense as iron).<br/>
<br/>
Seeing it in person would help.  Might still be a puzzler.<br/>

  Yeah, the yamagane tsuba is massive. I will have to measure it when I get a<br/>
