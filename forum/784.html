I found "fabric inlay" called poe-mock saang-gum or choum iybsa.  I found other inlay types which seem to be "true inlay" called ipsa, iyabsa and unipsa.  The last two were for silver inlay on steel, but the description sounded more like hira-zogan.  I didn't have any success searching for more information on poe-mock saang-gum or choum iybsa.  Perhaps someone with Korean language skills could find more.  Anyone?<br/>
<br/>
There is quite a bit of information on kum-boo (or keum-boo, kum-bu) which is a gold to silver heat fusion technique that seems to be popular with contemporary metalworkers.  Nothing to do with nunome though.<br/>

  Does anyone know the Korean word for such stuff, by the way?<br/>
