----------------------------------------<br/>
Prior to their redefinition by Ogawa in 1987, the Namban group of<br/>
tsuba had received scant attention from scholars. In part, this had<br/>
been due to the lack of a clearly defined categorisation, making<br/>
systematic attribution of the group difficult and thus preventing<br/>
coherent study of the corpus as a whole. Dr John Lissenden uses this<br/>
redefinition as the starting point in his accessible, creative and<br/>
thoroughly researched study of Namban tsuba, for which he was awarded<br/>
the degree of Master of Arts in East Asian Studies by the University<br/>
of Durham in 2002.<br/>
<br/>
The author has made good use of the research that has been previously<br/>
done by European and Japanese students, but has also been originally<br/>
critical of some of the established scholarship. This approach has<br/>
allowed him to present interpretations of Namban tsuba that are indeed<br/>
new. Among collectors and curators, some aspects of this study will be<br/>
debated  even contested  but the clarity of the author's position<br/>
will cause them to reconsider some of their originally held beliefs.<br/>
<br/>
Collectors also will value this study because it presents an<br/>
innovative categorisation of this previously neglected group of sword<br/>
guards, and serves to clarify the diversity and relationships of the<br/>
Namban style. Including, as it does, expositions on both gilding and<br/>
casting as related to this group of tsuba, the author's reappraisal<br/>
also uses the data on sword furniture as a new source of insight and<br/>
information on historical developments in East Asia during the 16th to<br/>
18th centuries.</div>
