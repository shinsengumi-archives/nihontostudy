<h3>I am at a &#39;stand-still&#39;</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1063305821">"I'm back!" And I have a few easy questions about three new tsuba to my collection. Please view my photo album 'Elliott's Album'. The first three tsuba are the ones. I need a 'kick' n the butt to get me going. Is the first tsuba Heianjo? The symbol thats inlayed is a flower? or ? Is the second tsuba Kinai? I am not confident in my decision. The third is Tembo, can anyone start the mei for me or give me some suggestions as to 'who' signed this?<br/>

Thanks for the push.............<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1933152545">The second could be late Edo Kinai. As to the mei on the third it starts Sado or Sashu and could be Hisanori or Hisakiyo, very hard to read so I'm probably wrong on that. john<br/>
