<h3>Menuki kantei</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-682888097">Hi all - <br/>
<br/>
I've just placed photos (front/back) of a pair of interesting menuki in the Yahoo album which, I hope, the below link will show to you:<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
  These came off a rather nice, large katana that I just sold to a friend a couple weeks ago. Many of you will recall the discussions that went on years ago (Tom Buttweiler days) regarding Ezo menuki. <br/>
<br/>
  This pair could very well fit the bill for Ezo, but I don't know. They are rather thin base material and are fairly large, measuring 49 mm (1.9"), thereabout. They do not have posts. The base material could be a yamagani and has the "worn" gold wash that Ezo display. <br/>
<br/>
  The other question regarding these menuki, what motif are they representing? The creature appears to have the body of a shishi but the face of a beaked tengo. Anybody have an answer to this?<br/>
<br/>
  Interesting menuki that hmmmm, should had maybe stayed with the other "Hartmann menuki"...oh well. <br/>

They look like Ezo type menuki to me.  The beak is a trunk.  Elephants appear in Buddhist art from quite early times and are often rendered rather unrealistically.  But, since these have the shishi-like fringes of hair they probably represent baku, a mythical chimera.<br/>
