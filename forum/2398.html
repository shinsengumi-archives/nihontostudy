You can't tell much from the photos.  Unfortunately you don't include a <br/>
photo of the kisaki.  The simple iron mounts could indicate a very old <br/>
piece.  They could also indicate one of those very low quality arsenal <br/>
pieces they kept to use as loaners to the ashigaru.  The blade looks <br/>
like it needs a full polish. Uninspiring copper habaki.  The tsuka is <br/>
badly wrapped in what looks like synthetic tsuka-ito.  I usually pass on <br/>
buying anything that looks like this.  I especially take a pass if they <br/>
won't let you look at the nakago.  Some people think you have to destroy <br/>
the handle to get it off.  Have you explained to the owner that they <br/>
just slip on and off?  Unless you like the way it looks and can get it <br/>
for peanuts, my recommendation is to keep looking.<br/>

As Bob recommended, unless this sword some cheap--$US200?--you should save your money and spend it more wisely. This blade length is pretty typical for WWII swords. You might also check the cutting edge right at the habaki to see if this is sharp or flat; Most (but not all) WWII blades will have a dulled "flat" spot at this point. The blade looks in terrible shape and if you are unable to "see some promise" in the sword, let the next buyer take the gamble. Leave it alone and save your money for a better sword.  <br/>
