<h3>Akasaka Tsuba?</h3>
by <i>tsubahunter</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-598614281">I know that there are some knowledgeable tsuba collectors on this list, and I <br/>
would like your opinions and thoughts good, bad or indifferent.  I recently <br/>
purchased this tsuba on eBay.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry I don't have better pictures.  I don't have a digital camera.  These <br/>
are the pictures I grabbed off eBay before they disappeared.  The pictures are <br/>
in my folder "Lou's Stuff."  The piece looks better in person.<br/>
<br/>
I like many collectors am still learning.  I was wondering if anyone out <br/>
there is knowledgeable enough to attribute this piece to one of the smiths of the <br/>
Akasaka school.  It is extremely thick.  Somewhere between 9 and 9.5 mm.  I <br/>
don't have any calipers at home so that is the best I can do.  It is 81 X 79 mm <br/>
in diameter.  This extreme thickness seems quite strange.  None of the Akasaka <br/>
tsuba in Sassano's book or Kremers' book are this thick.  From my limited <br/>
knowledge I thought that earlier Akasaka pieces are very open like this one and <br/>
are influenced by the Owari style.  I'm not sure if I would say that the theme <br/>
is Owari in style but I would say that the thickness is.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks to all who contribute their thoughts to this thread.<br/>
