<br/>
Recently my collecting friends and I exhibited some of our swords at the Benalla Art Gallery in country Victoria for two months.  When that ended we installed a larger exhibition at the Hamilton Art Gallery also in country Victoria.  To look at pictures of the Hamilton exhibition please go to:<br/>

<br/>
The swords on exhibition range from ca1260 to ca1860, all found in Victoria and professionally restored in Japan by a top artisan.  Each sword has been examined by eminent scholars of the Nihonto at the NBTHK sword museum in Tokyo and awarded a "paper" certifying its authenticity and art-level (there are 4 ranks of "paper").  This is the largest ever exhibition of properly restored and authenticated Japanese art swords ever held in the Southern Hemisphere.  There is also a link to the Hamilton Art Gallery itself, and a link to a downloadable pdf catalogue - the Gallery are currently charging $5 for the catalogues they have...<br/>
<br/>
I would like to publicly thank and acknowledge the expertise of our mate in collecting, Richard Turner in Perth, for his fantastic help in setting these images up for sharing with others.<br/>
<br/>
Best regards,<br/>
<br/>
Barry Thomas.<br/>
