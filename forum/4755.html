<br/>
Can anyone elaborate on where these fit in historically?  From my <br/>
understanding of early menuki from Buttweiler the Ezo (aka: Shoki <br/>
Kinko) developed into the Ko Mino but I am wondering if the Ezo <br/>
continued along side the Mino group.  These are very sophisticated in <br/>
construction but have the typical patina of the Ezo although in much <br/>
better condition than usually seen.<br/>
Thanks much!</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1424949831">It was my impression that menuki assigned to Ezo were not only made with a thin plate but also they had a unique method of -- and I'm not sure of the correct terminology here -- gilding on them, something similar to found in Chinese artworks. A year or so ago I wrote an article for the JSS/US to illustrate some menuki depicting the mythical "baku." The one set of menuki were fairly large sized as one might expect in Ezo but the other set were what I'd call "normal" menuki size, but they also had all the other characteristics of Ezo. To me, it seemed somewhat unusual to find the "baku" creature depicted on menuki thought to be Ezo. Earlier, I did show these to both Jim Gilbert and Bob Haynes and they agreed that they appeared to be Ezo works. But really, I wonder who knows; Buttweiler's writings on Ezo are about all I've ever really found regarding Ezo, at least what comes to mind tonight. <br/>
<br/>
Here now is a nice Echizen Kanenori katana that was found in nice quality WWII gunto mounting. What's kind of unique is that the tsuka has menuki depicting a fairly large "tiger" which -- judging while held in place under wrapping -- really does have the look of possibly being Ezo. The "worn gold gilding" is there, the size is right, but I wonder. I'd love to remove these but find it difficult to bring myself to unwrap this tsuka in order to "get them into my hand." (The wrap is already broken, but remains almost all there and intact.) Now I would think it unusual, as with the "baku," to find Ezo menuki depicting a running "tiger." It is a temptation to have a look at these, for sure! If these are no Ezo, I wonder where they should be placed? <br/>

this is from a restoration project by Dr. Lewitte ( spelling ? )for a  <br/>
massive  naginata naoshi papered to Hoju ( early Muromachi ) by the  NBTHK.<br/>
The tsuka  has gold brocade ( instead of same ).<br/>
Dr. Lewitte has the brocade  and the saya cleaned up in Japan,  purchased a <br/>
signed  shoami katana size tsuba, big Hizen style f/k and this  Ezo menuki to <br/>
complete the restoration.<br/>
 <br/>
The  Ezo menuki is 7 cm. in length.<br/>
 <br/>
Above info are from private correspondence between the good Doctor and a  <br/>
good friend of mine who passed the deal to me..................<br/>
