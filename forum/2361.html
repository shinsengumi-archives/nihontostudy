<div id="ygrps-yiv-416273109">I have many questions, as I'm fairly new at this.  I have a lot of books on Japanese Swords, but<br/>
none of them have much on Tsubas.  I have a whole list of Books that Jim had up on his website,<br/>
which I'm trying to find out how to get some of them.  What books are really good and where can I<br/>
get them?<br/>
<br/>
Also, I purchased a set of Tsuba's from a Local Auction House in Portland, Oregon and need to find<br/>
info on them.  Can we send the photos on this list, or do I need to put them up on my website and<br/>
put a hyperlink to them?<br/>

Welcome to the list, have fun with many years of collecting and study!<br/>
<br/>
Your message gives me as good an excuse as any to mention that my booksite<br/>
is open for business, and I have many of the titles on Jim's always helpful<br/>
reading list on hand, and much more.<br/>
<br/>
It's really hard to tell from the photos, but my initial reaction was that<br/>
your tsuba are cast, but only a careful examination in hand would confirm or<br/>
deny that feeling. <br/>
<br/>
Everyone else must be in shock over the Red Sox win, otherwise I'm sure<br/>
there would be more feedback.<br/>

I recommend "Tsuba no Bi".<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.sanmei.com/shop_e/enter.html">http://www.sanmei.com/shop_e/enter.html</a><br/>
Look under "Books". Price is $22.76 or such+ plus<br/>
shipping.<br/>
<br/>
It is in Japanese, but bunches of pictures and simple<br/>
descriptions. Flip to the picture that reminds you of<br/>
your tsuba, and translate the name of the school. It<br/>
should give you a decent general sense of different<br/>
tsuba schools.<br/>
