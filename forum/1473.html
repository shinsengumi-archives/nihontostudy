are they that rarely available or have I just missed seeing them.<br/>

A long time ago Tsuruta put one up on the Aoi website. I jumped on it, and<br/>
got an email back confirming I had it. The next day I got an apologetic<br/>
email saying that when he went to the shop he found it had been sold to a<br/>
walk-in customer. So it goes.<br/>
<br/>
A few years ago Andy Quirt had one that is in the Kremmers book, and I had<br/>
him send it to me on approval. In addition to the nosebleed price, it just<br/>
did not grab me, and I sent it back. Bob Haynes later shared with me the<br/>
fact that had Kremmers over cleaned all his guards, and that's what had<br/>
turned me off without knowing at the time that was the cause.<br/>
<br/>
I suspect that Yagyu guards - maybe most really great guards - change hands<br/>
either at the big auction houses or privately.<br/>

Yagyu guards are not that uncommon.<br/>
At the annual Dai Token Ichi there are<br/>
always a few to be seen. They are<br/>
briskly sold if rationally priced.<br/>
<br/>
I have been collecting them for 25 years.<br/>
I probably have 15-20 at this time.<br/>
<br/>
I sold the piece you referred to that is in the<br/>
Kremers book about 15 years ago to a European collector<br/>
that was subsequently offered by A. Quirt.<br/>
<br/>
You were smart not to buy it.<br/>
The reason I sold it ($1,200) was because<br/>
it papered as Yagyu kodai (later generation).<br/>
I sold it as such.<br/>
<br/>
That fact seems to have been missing from the<br/>
description in the Kremers book.<br/>
<br/>
P.S. To date no Yagyu tsuba have been<br/>
designated as Juyo Tosogu.<br/>
