The qualities of the best Jingo pieces do not come through well in photographs.  The first generation's iron plate is just outstanding, even if the decoration is not to your taste.  I was really surprised when I first handled one in Japan because it was something I never "got" from the illustrations I had looked at.<br/>
<br/>
Studying Jingo tsuba outside of Japan is tough since the overwhelming majority of pieces we have are later work that really isn't very good and does not give any sense of the quality of the first work.<br/>
<br/>
The style of the brass suemon zogan decoration does take some getting used to.  It's probably not for everyone, but definitely try to see a top example in person if you can.  What do you think of Hirata Hikozo's work in copper, for example?  Or Raku, Shino and Oribe pottery?<br/>

I would add a phrase that is often used for such seemingly crude pieces <br/>
-- artless art. Very Zen, eh?<br/>

Everything Jim has mention is absolutely on the money but the quality of the iron plate is like that of silk to the touch.<br/>

<h3>Re: [nihontostudy] Jingo Tsuba</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1525495754">Hi:<br/>
 I will take a stab at your very interesting question, one of many that<br/>
you seem to come up with. You have provided part of the answer yourself<br/>
by saying "rare" though of course that begs the question, why rare?<br/>
Jingo tsuba were made in Higo and the work of the first three<br/>
generations is considered particularly fine, thereafter as in most lines<br/>
following generations could not stop adding gold and silver effects,<br/>
becoming too symmetric, adopting features from other groups, etc.<br/>
 Higo, being remote from Edo, tended to supply products in the kodogu<br/>
area, as with swords, that were somewhat outside the mainstream and they<br/>
tended to be somewhat aloof from fashion elsewhere and to maintain that<br/>
difference longer than other groups. Their market was more the samurai<br/>
and less the merchant than would be true for people supplying the market<br/>
in Edo and Osaka. The first three developed naturalistic designs never<br/>
seen before or since, and thereby reflected the wabi sabi aesthetic that<br/>
was very influential, particularly with the more severe samurai in the<br/>
early Edo period. Their designs are very three dimensional, tastefully<br/>
accented with gold and silver. Their most complementary counterpart<br/>
seems to be found in the work of the Kanayama which, while sukashi, have<br/>
the same rustic, subtle and unpretentious character. People also wonder<br/>
whey they tend to go for some serious money. Jingo tsuba are instantly<br/>
recognizable and fit well with any severe koshirae.<br/>
 Just a stab.<br/>
