Hitachi no Kami Muneshige of Settsu. Based on your photos that is my  <br/>
best guess. I am also curious about the temper you mentioned, is it  <br/>
only on the reverse? Can you show photos of the hamon for each of  <br/>

It's a pretty lousy MUNE-  I have another character in mind but haven't looked for it yet.  It is well-known that most signatures on kogatana are spurious, and IMHO these are no exception.  Elliot, I am sorry but it pains me to say that the characters are crudely chiselled with no finesse whatsoever.  A cursory run through my kogatana book does not reveal any examples signed in such a rudimentary manner.  I have found a Tadahiro but it is nothing like the piece under consideration.  I doubt there is much to learn from these pieces.  It always pays to bear in mind one of Albert Yamanaka's immortal sayings "Looking at bad swords ruins your eye".  It is no less true for kogatana...  But as Tom says, thanks for posting Elliot.  As a counter to Albert's advice, one of my truisms has always been "Look at everything"...<br/>

I like your truism of 'look at everything'. How else are you going <br/>
to learn. Of course, you must look at bad and good. Then you <br/>
understand the difference. <br/>
<br/>
I should not have brought up the temper - it's a lousy job of a fake <br/>
temper. Whoever applied the fake temper should be shot! I refuse to <br/>
leave it alone, I must have it removed. You can see the scratches <br/>
left by what-ever tool the idiot used. Yes. it's only on the side <br/>
opposite the (?)mei. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks, let me know about the other character.<br/>

I have been away dealing with 'family' tragedy. Having returned to <br/>
a 'Nihonto' state of mind, were you able to find that other character <br/>
for the lousy mei of Mune-? Tom gave me a lead that I have studied.<br/>
<br/>
I am continuing my pursuit of possibly figuring out this signature. <br/>

Thanks for Tom's and your effort,<br/>
