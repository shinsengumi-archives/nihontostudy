<h3>A gimei Somin kodzuka ...</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-350681717">Dear colleagues<br/>
<br/>
Working on the assumption that any kodogu signed Somin is almost <br/>
certainly gimei, I should be interested in your comments on the <br/>
kodzuka in my photo album JPL.  It depicts, on a polished copper <br/>
ground, Shoki mounted on a shishi.  The single image is rendered on <br/>
both surfaces in a skillful katakiri-bori, and is continuous across <br/>
both edges of the kodzuka.<br/>
<br/>
It is inscribed on the reverse SOMIN with kao, and also bears the <br/>
inscription GIONEN ROKUSU ROKUSAI (aged 66 years old).<br/>
<br/>
It is ex the Peak and Gardiner collections, having been purchased by <br/>
its previous owner in 1948.<br/>
<br/>
Any and all comments will be most gratefully received.<br/>
<br/>

<h3>An introduction and three questions</h3>
by <i>deanwayland</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-994378501">Dear All,<br/>
<br/>
This is my first post to this list, and before asking my question I felt<br/>
that it would make sense for me to briefly say a little about myself and<br/>
what I do, so that you can better respond to my queries.<br/>
<br/>
I run a tiny historical re-enactment society here in the UK, which is<br/>
trying to portray the period of first contact between Europeans and the<br/>
Japanese (1543-1640) to a reasonable degree of authenticity. For an<br/>
illustration and a more detailed explanation please see the link at the<br/>
foot of this email.<br/>
<br/>
As part of our general aim to gradually improve the quality of all our<br/>
equipment, one of our number Tracie Anderson, has been learning the art<br/>
of kumihimo, and she has got quite good over the last few years. So much<br/>
so, that her husband Simon, has decided that he wishes to have his sword<br/>
rebound in a silk braid of her making. Likewise several others of our<br/>
group are now beginning to form a disorderly queue.<br/>
<br/>
Now, as to my first question; during the period 1500-1640 is there any<br/>
evidence for tsuka ito being made with other than plain colours? <br/>
<br/>
All the surviving examples that I've seen to date, are bound with plain<br/>
colours, but this could be a function of later re-binding fashion, or<br/>
the fact that I have really poor eyesight:-) <br/>
<br/>
Today, you see in numerous kumihimo books, a huge range of multi-<br/>
coloured patterned braid, but they rarely if ever give a date for their<br/>
introduction. On armour you see the so-called "woodpecker" style used<br/>
for the mimi-ito and the herringbone type used as part of the trim on<br/>
quality foundation fabrics, but that's it, as far as I know that is.<br/>
I've seen plenty of modern fancy sageo offered for iaitou, but I have no<br/>
idea if this is an in-period or a modern feature.<br/>
<br/>
Tracie has made flat braid with spiral, diamond, herring bone, and a<br/>
host of other patterns and is about to try her hand at woodpecker. She<br/>
can work with up to 16 different colours at the moment, but is having<br/>
some more bobbins made to enable her to go up to as many as 32 if needs<br/>
be.<br/>
<br/>
As we are about to embark upon having several new custom weapons made<br/>
here in the UK, with decent iron fittings, including replica Owari<br/>
sukashi tsuba, it would be nice to have all the braid hand made in<br/>
correct period patterns (assuming they existed), so that they look more<br/>
like 16th/17th century swords rather than modern iaitou. Although the<br/>
fittings are correctly hand forged here in the UK, the blades we use are<br/>
sadly not traditionally crafted. They are individually made by a UK<br/>
smith, with blunt edges and durability as their prime requirement. This<br/>
is because they are used for mock combat, which does involve some<br/>
contact. It would be a crime to wreck a correctly made piece of art in<br/>
such an encounter, and that's leaving aside the issue of the expense.<br/>
<br/>
Now for my next question; is there any evidence for simple iron fittings<br/>
for tachi or han-dachi?<br/>
<br/>
All the tachi that I have come across in books and museums, have been<br/>
mounted with various forms of fine gilt fittings, which is only to be<br/>
expected, as the common run of the mill type equipment rarely survives<br/>
(again assuming that they existed in the first place). Gilt fittings<br/>
would be of too high a quality for the class of warriors that we are<br/>
currently trying to recreate. Most of us carry uchi-gatana as you would<br/>
expect, but it would be nice to have the option on mounting the blade in<br/>
han-dachi koshirae, or having a tachi made. I understand that some no-<br/>
dachi were reputed to have had rather poor iron  fittings, but I have no<br/>
idea if such things were ever applied to the tachi of the lower or<br/>
middle ranking mounted warriors. <br/>
<br/>
Incidentally, we will be having a no-dachi made, starting very shortly,<br/>
which should be finished in a few months, assuming everything goes well. <br/>
<br/>
Finally, a slightly frivolous question; in combat, the only swords we<br/>
have that actually "ring" upon their occasional contact with another,<br/>
are of purely symmetrical design. Asymmetric weapons, like rapiers and<br/>
katana do not ring at all. Now in movies like the Twilight Samurai and<br/>
Ran, there can be heard the "ching" of blade to blade contact, leaving<br/>
aside any issue of technique, is this just the director having the<br/>
effect dubbed in because the audience expect to hear it, or does the<br/>
real thing ring? My expectation is that they would not, for as I<br/>
understand it, it is the energy oscillating to and fro across a<br/>
symmetrical weapon that produces the pure note, just like a bell. I ask,<br/>
because when giving talks upon Japanese history etc. I often get asked<br/>
why our swords do not ring as in the movies. I give the above<br/>
explanation, but if this failure to ring is merely a function of poorly<br/>
made replicas, and I'm wrong about the real thing, I would really like<br/>
to know, so I can avoid making a twit of myself in front of a<br/>
potentially educated audience!<br/>
<br/>
Okay, that's it, any suggestions, advice, heckling?<br/>
<br/>

<h3>RE: [nihontostudy] An introduction and three questions</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1016921003">Hi Dean,<br/>
<br/>
Welcome to both lists. I will try to answer a few of your questions very<br/>
simply. You can see photos of contemporary mounts for the period in question<br/>
in the Tokyo National Museum publication Uchigatana Koshirae. You will see<br/>
there that the earlier wraps are done in leather, typically a dark green or<br/>
blue along with black and the lacquered over. The same is also lacquered<br/>
black and the saya are leather wrapped and also lacquered black. Tsuba are<br/>
typically plain iron, there is a simple fuchi, more decorative menuki,<br/>
sometimes in gold or with a lot of gold foil coverings and a black-lacquered<br/>
horn kashira with the handle wrap going over the tip of the kashira. Katana<br/>
typically have a kogai in the saya and the saya have a distinctive round<br/>
kurikata and an "obi-hook." As you move into the Momoyama period wraps and<br/>
saya get gaudy with multicolored leather wraps, red saya and what not. I<br/>
suggest you get the uchigatana book, which will answer all your question<br/>
visually.<br/>

<h3>Re: [nihontostudy] A gimei Somin kodzuka ...</h3>
by <i>yamaimojg</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1710065141">Dear John,<br/>
Doing a quick check of Wakayama I don't see much hope here.  In the reference examples the first stroke of the first kanji (short vertical top center) touches or crosses the third stroke (top horizontal).  I don't see any with a significant gap.  The 6th stroke (center vertical bottom) should be straight with some widening at the end, not "hooked."  The 7th and 8th strokes (bottom diagonals) have a different shape.  The 3rd-5th strokes have different endings.  All of the horizontal strokes of the genuine mei have more of an upslope to them.<br/>
<br/>
I'm not a Somin maven, but his signature is fairly consistent and this one is different on every stroke of the first kanji.  There are differences in the rest as well, but I'll stop here.<br/>
<br/>
It's fairly nice katakiri-bori work, but not up to the level it would have to be.<br/>
<br/>
Jim<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  Dear colleagues<br/>
<br/>
  Working on the assumption that any kodogu signed Somin is almost <br/>
  certainly gimei, I should be interested in your comments on the <br/>
  kodzuka in my photo album JPL.  It depicts, on a polished copper <br/>
  ground, Shoki mounted on a shishi.  The single image is rendered on <br/>
  both surfaces in a skillful katakiri-bori, and is continuous across <br/>
  both edges of the kodzuka.<br/>
<br/>
  It is inscribed on the reverse SOMIN with kao, and also bears the <br/>
  inscription GIONEN ROKUSU ROKUSAI (aged 66 years old).<br/>
<br/>
  It is ex the Peak and Gardiner collections, having been purchased by <br/>
  its previous owner in 1948.<br/>
<br/>
  Any and all comments will be most gratefully received.<br/>

What do you use for an email program?  <br/>
<br/>
I put in the kanji using MS language tools, then as I upload the email, Outlook Express pops up a window asking how do I want it sent.  I select UNICODE, and it seems to work.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2098766322">Hi Richard,<br/>
It isn't Yahoo that is causing the Kanji to not go through, it is the <br/>
way the List was set up and as I'm on other lists which either allow or <br/>
do not allow for Attachments or does or doesn't allow for HTML, either <br/>
of these could stop it from going through.  I have one list which allows <br/>
for Greek Symbols to go through, but another list doesn't and will <br/>
convert anything that is in Greek to come over as English letters.  For <br/>
instance, (Delta) D would come over as a D.<br/>

I use Firefox and Thunderbird, and if you pull up Format:  Fonts:  if <br/>
you don't have Kanji in there, you won't be able to send it, Greek comes <br/>
up as Symbols, but Kanji might come up that way too.  Check it out and <br/>
experiment.  Then when the e-mail is ready to send, then hit Send in <br/>
Plain Text and HTML and not Plain Text, when the box comes up.<br/>
