Rich, <br/>

The Vic Gov has banned swords - announced y'day and in today's Herald Sun page 11.  I'm still off-air so can't notify the world, but I guess there's no hurry.  More details later as they come to hand.<br/>

Very -off the cuff- impression is it was later Shinto<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-440831874">Hi Verne, I guess they ( the police/government ) need people to be <br/>
honest enough to come forward with any un registered swords. This does <br/>
not effect genuine collectors, though they will need to have a permit <br/>
and a Alarm on their house. Importing swords will be a different matter. <br/>
A license would have to be produced then I would assume. Also, I am in <br/>
Perth and visit Victoria as often as I can ( I am from there originally <br/>
) and taking any swords in with me will also be interesting.<br/>
<br/>
My major concern is the amount of old WW2 swords that widows and the <br/>
like may have that are handed in to be destroyed. These swords are not <br/>
the problem, it is the junk you buy from sports and knive stores that <br/>
are the real problem.<br/>
<br/>
There is more information coming in soon. I will forward what I get as I <br/>
get it, or Barry will.<br/>

   I cannot tell a lot from your sword photos. I wish<br/>
someone more experienced would step in and comment, as<br/>
I don't think I am very qualified with less than 5<br/>
years experience. Take my comments just as a beginning<br/>
point and allow for the fact that others may feel I am<br/>
absolutely wrong.<br/>
<br/>
The kissaki looks chu to ko-kissaki and front part<br/>
tapers quickly. What is the length of the cutting<br/>
edge? <br/>
   Tobiyaki (if correct term) is associated with<br/>
So-Den. My feeling off the sword is that it is Shinto<br/>
and hastily shortened for WW2 mounts. Out of polish,<br/>
unsigned, and just photos....very hard for me to tell.<br/>
    I may be entirely misreading the blade, but am<br/>
operating under the belief that few if any WWII smiths<br/>
executed tobiyaki. I do not know which Shinto or<br/>
Shinshinto schools did.<br/>

<h3>Re: [nihontostudy] New member  // Verne&#39;s Sword</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1573763070">Hi Curran,<br/>
<br/>
What can I do to provide better photos? What angles<br/>
and such? I'll also make precise measurments.<br/>
A polish would bring out the hamon much clearer, I had<br/>
one local collector look at it and he felt that it was<br/>
Koto period and also cut down as you stated. Blade<br/>
light and superbly balanced...feels like an extension<br/>
of your hand.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
Verne<br/>

 <br/>
<br/>
This group sounds very interesting. I'm happy to find this group. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I have a web-page www.sharpweaponcenter.com<br/>
<<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.sharpweaponcenter.com/">http://www.sharpweaponcenter.com/</a>> . This page is Sweden's biggest page<br/>
about Japanese swords with forum and facts. I have around 262 members. <br/>
<br/>
I have working on this page since 2002. The page has become bigger than I<br/>
thought. Today I have around 120 visitors every day. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
If you have some information you want to tell the Swedish collectors about<br/>
Japanese swords just send a mail.  <br/>
