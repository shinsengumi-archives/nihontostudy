      Let me follow up the shinsa'ing tsuka thread. You may recall the<br/>
tsuka I discussed on this list last year that has Jomon age projectile<br/>
points set in as menuki. The kashira is clearly old and original but simply<br/>
plain iron. The fuchi matched - barely, and the wrap is nice and old.<br/>
Overall, I see little here that warrants "papering", but I would like to<br/>
get a sense of the age and regional origin of the handle. Would the shinsa<br/>
team be able and willing to say anything in a case like this?<br/>
      I realize that this sound for all the world like the problem I<br/>
presented to the last NTHK shinsa with the putative "chokuto". Maybe my lot<br/>
in life is to be a thorn in the shins side!<br/>

An assessment of age is a normal part of koshirae shinsa.  Given the uniqueness of the tsuka, I don't know how much more can be said, but it would certainly be interesting to find out.  <br/>
<br/>
Hagihara-sensei has a Kofun jidai tsuba that was modified for wear on an Edo period wakizashi, so I would imagine that he'd be enjoy seeing this piece.<br/>
