 </span></blockquote>"...should be submitted if only just for the experience..." - With the recent<br/>
increases in shinsa costs I believe this experience (of submitting a sword to<br/>
the NBTHK Juyo shinsa) can cost US$3,000 over and above "the education"??  And<br/>
it must first pass the Tokubetsu Hozon shinsa.  I would think that very, very<br/>
few swords could go straight from Hozon to the Juyo shinsa.  All in all, VERY<br/>
expensive.  Friends of mine have tried in aggregate FOUR times for Juyo shinsa<br/>
and 3 failed.  Payment is in advance and no refund if your sword doesn't "get<br/>
up".<br/>
<br/>
A mate of mine was in Japan staying with his polisher.  The togishi was<br/>
repolishing a sword that was already Juyo - ALREADY JUYO, note.  It was being<br/>
repolished because there were features of that particular smith that were not<br/>
evident in its present state of polish as a Juyo-ranked sword.  The repolish was<br/>
successful as the sword made Tokubetsu Juyo and the polisher won an annual prize<br/>
for the work.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1729388000">I would suggest sending the blade to someone like Cary Condell who has a<br/>
good relationship with Tanobe sensei.<br/>
<br/>
Often, Tanobe will look over the blade ahead of time and tell you what he<br/>
thinks of the blade, what level it will get to, and what you need to do with<br/>
it in order for it to go higher.<br/>
<br/>
It's not that expensive, and it's very much worth it so you don't spend<br/>
unneeded money chasing after a paper the sword won't get.<br/>
