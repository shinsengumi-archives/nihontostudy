<div id="ygrps-yiv-525153733">Hi Guys/Gals,<br/>
A recent purchase of a very nice item is nudging me to sell off some <br/>
of my swords and fittings.<br/>
<br/>
I have just listed a top quality sword in very beautifal and near <br/>
perfect mounts. It has been totally restored in Japan and is a very <br/>
nice package to say the least.<br/>
<br/>
I had it listed on my site for $6500.00, I lowered the buy it now to <br/>
around $4900.00 on ebay.<br/>
<br/>
Here is the link: <br/>
