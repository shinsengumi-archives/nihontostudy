<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-391739522">Try Robert Burawoy's little book:<br/>
<br/>
"The Picture Book of Old Tsuba"<br/>
500 copies printed in 1983<br/>
<br/>
Up the back, under "SIGNATURES, PROBLEMS, HEADACHES" he begins with the comment:<br/>
<br/>
"We are now going to examine the first signatures, and people with immense reputation too..."<br/>
<br/>
He then examines case by case the main people.  Of  Nobuiye he notes:<br/>
<br/>
"NOBUIYE: Here we are on a little sounder ground.  The accepted notion is that there are two REAL Nobuiye, and a bunch of later provincial artists using genuinely the same name (plus a LOT of fakes).  They lived in Momoyama period.  The two examples shown here if not the best, seem real, I do not know of any other acceptable in the West.  The first Nobuiye is credited with one great quality, which the tsuba reproduced here has but probably does not show on the picture: An extraordinary surface reminding the glaze of a Raku pottery."<br/>
<br/>
A nice little book for one so ignorant as I...<br/>

I'm fairly certain you aren't referring to the<br/>
different Nobuiye (Akasaka Nobuiye, Myochin Nobuiye,<br/>
Owari Nobuiye, Echizen Nobuiye, etc). Jim or someone<br/>
else will comment best on this, but I was reading<br/>
through Haynes Catalogs last night and did come upon<br/>
across a section comparing 3 examples of 'Nobuiye<br/>
longmei'. Basically looks like his ana spacing left<br/>
him too narrow a space for his normal signature and he<br/>
consequently squeezed out his signature with one<br/>
character at the top and bottom V of area between the<br/>
two openings.<br/>
   I don't know how much of a variation this was<br/>
considered.<br/>

I can't think of anything in English better than the Tsuba Geijutsu-Ko by Toigoye and Haynes.  I'm sure that there is further commentary in Joly's translations of Akiyama republished in the NCJSC newsletters some years ago, but I don't have them organized or indexed.<br/>
<br/>
Nobuie Tsuba by Nakamura is as good a picture sources as any, at least for having large numbers of examples to compare.  Each mei is attributed to a type in the text of the oshigata section.  The attribution is usually at or near the end of the text (lower left portion).  <br/>
&#25918;&#12428;&#37528; hanare-mei, &#22826;&#23383;&#37528; futoji- mei, &#35440;&#12426;&#37528; sumari-mei, &#24038;&#20670;&#37528; sakei-mei and &#30002;&#32963;&#37528; katchu-mei are ones I saw frequently when I flipped through the book.  <br/>
<br/>
In the past there were something like 8 or more categories of mei in use.  Most signatures these days are lumped into futoji-mei and hanare-mei.  There's quite a bit of variability among accepted examples in each category though, so things are still not simple.  Wakayama shows some details about the different signatures in the first volume of his Toso Kodogu Koza.  No doubt there are other comparisons in the various survey books.<br/>

It's a difficult area.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1377257021">It's a major deviation.  One of these wide-spaced mei guards was submitted to shinsa in Chicago and failed as gimei.  I don't know if any examples have been accepted as valid.  Personally, I don't see why anyone would sign like that if attempting to deceive.  The workmanship of these looks early Edo period, so it may be the signature of another "other" Nobuie working then.<br/>
<br/>
That kind of wide spaced signature is rare for tsuba in general.  I have seen an Umetada signature like that, but that's about it.<br/>
