<h3>Ni-mai Awase Tsuba</h3>
by <i>maiorian</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-412744608">The mention of san-mai awase tsuba reminds me of a tsuba I had recently, I would welcome the lists' views  regarding this piece, it is constructed of two thin yamagane plates soldered together, in fact the tsuba appears to be entirely constructed of metal cut from the same thin sheet as the very broad two piece rim covering half the plate seems to be of the same thickness.<br/>
<br/>
I don't now have the tsuba so I can't give the size but I think the separate plates are each around 1.5mm thick, with a diameter of at least 8cm. From the colour of the metal I am guessing at a 16th century date although John Harding gave a Heian date to one in a catalogue he compiled! (One of the Sarzi-Amade selling catalogues).<br/>
<br/>
I think it possible that the maker was not a professional tsuba-ko as there is no reason to use such a complex construction method, the maker also does not seem to have a sense of the seppa-dai as a discrete area in itself, hence the curious decoration there that amazingly was applied before the nakago-ana was cut through.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps the makers of these tsuba were artisans who used this thin sheet yamagane for other purposes and saw a gap in the tsuba market. Does anyone know of other uses for this type of thin plate and decoration? <br/>
<br/>
I have seen these illustrated in japanese books, the only one that comes immediately to mind is in Nihon Toban Zusetsu by Takezawa, probably by the same maker as mine, as the same defective spiral punch was used for both tsuba, Takezawa called it 'ko-kinko' Any thoughts on this will be gratefully received.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-773562830">Hi Alan, I got the pic thanks. it is a wonderful looking tsuba. I can <br/>
see the Ko Kinko attribution, and I have also seen Tachi-shi as an <br/>
attribution (the book Kinko tsuba, small hardback in a series of three <br/>
that I forget the author off springs to mind)<br/>
<br/>
I have a killer flu at the moment so I will try and did some stuff up on <br/>
the weekend. It looks vaguely familiar except for the additional carving <br/>
you mentioned on the seppa dai.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, as I sad, this is a great looking guard, I like it a lot.<br/>
<br/>
cheers<br/>
