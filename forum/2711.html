Welcome!  As far as pictures go, what do you have to work with in the <br/>
way of camera/lighting?  there<br/>
are a number of techniques, not all of which are applicable to all <br/>
cameras...  Also, what are<br/>
you trying to capture?  The activities in the hada/ha, the overall shape <br/>
of the blade with the mune "lit up"<br/>
and the hamon line visible, closeups of the grain structure, pictures <br/>
with the nie/nioi "lit up", or...?<br/>
<br/>
A great place to start is to read Darcy's write up on nihonto.ca - have <br/>
you read this?<br/>
<br/>
Lately I've been experimenting with just using one big light and <br/>
blocking/reflecting light as needed - this seems<br/>
to work pretty well - I place the light at the end of the nakago shining <br/>
along the blade to light up stuff, and then I use<br/>
white cards to illuminate the back and kissaki - I also either use <br/>
filters or simply block the light shining on the nakago and<br/>
then use a white card to put some back (or a less dense nd filter <br/>
between the nakago and the light and no reflector card...).<br/>
here's a typical result:<br/>

here's one of my earlier attempts trying to use multiple lights<br/>

<br/>
I don't seem to have any glowing hamon/activity shots on my computer at <br/>
the moment - sorry...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
for getting pictures of hada/hamon structures, you can shoot straight on <br/>
(TURN OFF THE FLASH!!!) with a light to either side coming in<br/>
at a steep angle (or the beforementioned one side), and to get glowing <br/>
nie/nioi you really need to do the same thing you<br/>
do when looking at it (camera at an angle to the sword, light at an angle).<br/>
<br/>
Also, don't be afraid to use a really high f/stop to get more depth of <br/>
field (using a wider lens gets you more DOF as<br/>
well, but that can cause other problems if you go too wide) - just put <br/>
the camera on a tripod (use the shutter lockup<br/>
if you have it) and go for it - maximum "sharpness" might be at f/8, but <br/>
usually you're beyond the resolution of the system<br/>
that cranking on over to f/16 or tighter will result in no visable <br/>
degradation...<br/>
<br/>
The other thing to remember is that swords are effectively complex <br/>
mirrors - I tend to surround the sword with white/black<br/>
cards (sheets of foamboard) filling up the angles that would reflect <br/>
into the lens (I also have a big black sheet and a stand to<br/>
block stray reflections from ceilings, walls, etc., but that's another <br/>
story....).<br/>
<br/>
A good dissertation on lighting stuff is in a book called "color, light, <br/>
and magic" (can't remember the author at the moment) .<br/>
<br/>
Gotta run, Good Luck,<br/>

Impressive save on knowledge!<br/>
Looks I get a new book today.<br/>
<br/>
Richard, I love those photos. I can see much in<br/>
Darcy's photograph of things like the Kanemitsu, but<br/>
sometimes I would kill for an phenomenal full view<br/>
photo like your Kaneyoshi tanto.<br/>
   Absolutely lovely Yamato tanto.<br/>

Great fotos Richard (I'm really jealous). I have probably shot more rolls <br/>

me. I'll take your advice and read the articles and if I get anywhere, I'll <br/>

You're using a 35mm then?  What type?  I don't have any of my "film" <br/>
pics up, but I found it great for shooting<br/>
hada because it as a much wider dynamic range than my 10D - I actually <br/>
recently picked up a<br/>
Bronica GS-1 for doing overall sword pics, but I haven't gotten a chance <br/>
to try it with the 65mm<br/>
lens I also recently acquired, just to do sword pics (takes amazing <br/>
landscape pics though :-)  - and you can pick up medium format<br/>
stuff for a song these days  bwahaha....)  Film still has its uses :-) <br/>
 But I digress...   What kind of problems<br/>
are you having anyway?<br/>
<br/>
You might try finding the Hunter and Fuqua book sooner than later - its <br/>
Real Helpful in aiding you<br/>
to visualize what's going on...<br/>
<br/>
Good Luck,<br/>
