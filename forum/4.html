good idea - my delete finger was getting a little sore at certain <br/>
members' political diatribes, etc.,.<br/>
<br/>
There was an interesting thread started that I'd guess we all can talk <br/>
about here.  And that would<br/>
be tsuba size.<br/>
<br/>
I believe Jim has seen real nambokucho koshirae (or what's left of 'em) <br/>
- what size were the tsuba on these<br/>
monsters anyway?<br/>
<br/>
Also, was the tsuba size a "fashion" thing in general, or did it really <br/>
tend to get bigger during eras of war?<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, thanks for taking the initiative to try and get some serious <br/>
conversation back into a sword list...<br/>

I read in a piece by R. B. Caldwell that since the kamakura tachis were<br/>

 <br/>
they really only needed a light lacquered leather guard. <br/>

So it stands to reason that the Nambokucho massive swords that had<br/>
little fumbari were no where near as well balanced and must have needed<br/>
massive tsuba to match ??<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-774598206">Hi Matt et all,  Ithink that is exactly what I was saying. Thinner lighter tsuba were used for one handed sword action as the use of the sword was generally mounted ( from the horse ), later on in the The Muromachi, the action moved two the ground and became two handed ( both hands were free ) the sword didn't need to be as light and the tsuba became heavier to cope with the balance required for two handed use.<br/>
<br/>
This is at least how I recall it, I stand corrected and look for guidence if I am off the mark, especially with the periods I quoted, I'm trying this from memory.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1874714501">Richard,<br/>
The Nambokucho O-dachi koshirae that I have seen have moderate-sized tsuba.<br/>
I don't have measurements handy, but the ones I'm thinking of are nerikawa<br/>
tsuba that I would estimate to be in the 8 cm diameter range.<br/>
Proportionally, they look rather small on these very long koshirae.<br/>
<br/>
This would seem to favor the idea that the tsuba functioned as a hand stop<br/>
or a hand guard (or probably both) and that there was no need to scale the<br/>
tsuba up beyond hand-sized.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, some of the very large Ko-Tosho and Ko-Katchushi tsuba<br/>
are attributed to the Nambokucho jidai.  This may or may not be correct.  I<br/>
don't recall seeing a pre-Muromachi period koshirae mounted with one of<br/>
these.<br/>
<br/>
The question of tsuba size changing with time and function is a complicated<br/>
one that I don't think I have a pat answer for.  It's something I'd like to<br/>
continue to trade ideas on though.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-99776648">If anyone is interested, I can send you a copy of the Excel spreadsheet that<br/>
Richard mentioned.  While hardly a scientific sample, what I did was to go<br/>
through the Tokyo National Museum Uchigatana Koshirae book and record the<br/>
tsuba diameter, saya length and tsuka length for each illustrated katana or<br/>
wakizashi koshirae.  It's somewhat interesting to play with.<br/>
<br/>
It turns out that correlation between saya length (a proxy for blade length)<br/>
and tsuba diameter is fairly weak.  The correlation between tsuka length and<br/>
tsuba size is actually better.  The correlation between saya length and<br/>
tsuka length is very good.<br/>
<br/>
The average katana tsuba is 8.03 cm in diameter, but the range is 5.85-10.80<br/>
cm.<br/>
The average wakizashi tsuba is 6.59 cm in diameter, with a range of 4.90 to<br/>
8.60 cm.<br/>
<br/>
So, making definite statements about katana-size or wakizashi-sized tsuba on<br/>
size alone is pretty difficult.  There are no dates given for most of the<br/>
koshirae in the book, so that is not included in the spreadsheet.  There's<br/>
more work to do here.<br/>
