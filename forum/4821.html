<h3>NBTHK October Shinsa</h3>
by <i>neobliviscar</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-436940633">List,<br/>
<br/>
I've heard the NBTHK had a considerable number of<br/>
sword and fittings submittals, and was running behind<br/>
on the considerable workload.<br/>
   I'm sure the holidays didn't help either.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone able to confirm this? I had several pieces in<br/>
the October shinsa, one of which was to be part of a<br/>
lecture at the Tampa show. A few of the others I'd<br/>
thought to sell in Tampa.<br/>
   I assume results are out, but have not heard back.<br/>
They running that far behind?<br/>

<h3>Re: [nihontostudy] NBTHK October Shinsa</h3>
by <i>sworddad</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-989503082">Some political turmoil was going on earlier this year at the NBTHK and my understand is that this caused people to spin their wheels, shall I say. Mr. Tanobe told us in October that all of this has been resolved and things are moving ahead once again. I've no clue if this has delayed shinsa results although I suspect it has. Early in last year several swords sent over did take a longer than usual time to clear shinsa. At that time, according to what Tanobe san told me, they were simply hit with an unusually large number of shinsa submissions. I suspect it has been a combination of such things that my have slowed things down a bit. Hopefully 2007 will see things back into a more normal mode for them. <br/>
