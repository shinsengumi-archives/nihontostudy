<h3>sanmai tsuba</h3>
by <i>elliottshogun</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-958409997">HELP! I need some clarification;<br/>
 <br/>
Sanmai tsuba are tsuba made using three layers of metal held together by a fukurin. The word 'sanmai' does not designate a school or group, correct? <br/>
Kinko (Kinku) means metal worker. Ko-kinko is 'early' metal worker? Tsubako is tsuba maker.<br/>
Kagamishi - Is this a school (Ha) or metal worker? Do they or him make Sanmai tsuba? Is this related to the Kaga Ha?<br/>
<br/>
I have Ko-kinko tsuba, Sanmai tsuba, and one Kagamishi made tsuba. They all are made of three layers, held by fukurin. There is zogan on some, and all have some design formed by a substance under the outside layer of metal. How do you tell one from the other????<br/>
<br/>
I appreciate the time and education that you (all) give me.<br/>

the main culprits. Many of them are held together with two little <br/>

<br/>
The tsuba you are referring to as Sanmai, probably is Ko Kinko, but I <br/>
guess we would need to see it to be able to make a call like that. <br/>
Kagami shi (kagami = mirror, shi = maker) usually made tsuba that were <br/>
cast from bronze or yamagane.  I have not seen any sanmei kagamishi <br/>
tsuba but that does not mean there were not any. I will have a look in <br/>
Sasano's little book tonight at home and see if there is any reference.<br/>
<br/>
This is a typical Kagami-shi tsuba <br/>

<br/>
Most likely, all 3 tsuba you have are Ko Kinko.<br/>

<br/>
Richard is spot-on in his observations, of course.<br/>
<br/>
I'm thinking that it's worth noting that "Ko-Kinko" can tend to be a big box<br/>
in which to sort anything old (Ko) made of soft metal (Kinko) rather than<br/>
iron. So the materials can cover the gamut from brass, bronze, yamagane<br/>
("impure" copper), more refined copper, and even shakudo, and the techniques<br/>
can range from cast, forged, sanmai, various surface treatments, zogan, etc.<br/>
Some pieces can be easily classified by "school" in the roughest sense of<br/>
the word - cast guards are invariably "Kagamishi" - and somewhat more<br/>
decorated guards like your sanmai get called "Ko-Kinko" like they are some<br/>
pre-Kinko (fancy) guards. In fact some get further classified as Ko-Goto or<br/>
Ko-Mino when they look like the antecedent of those well defined schools<br/>
that fully flower as we move closer to Edo period.<br/>
<br/>
My own recent area of interest has been "tachikanagushi" guards which are<br/>
soft metal thought (by some) to be made by tachi makers who also made<br/>
fittings to go with the blades they made, which is (I think) an interesting<br/>
speculation without much empirical evidence. In any case you can see much of<br/>
that collection on Boris Markhasin's website, on the consignment page, at<br/>
yamabushiantiques.com.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I think the semantics and classification get in the way of simple<br/>
enjoyment of beautiful art objects, but I approach this study more from an<br/>
art angle.<br/>
<br/>

three that Sasano did on old soft metal guards, and worth keeping an eye out<br/>
for.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-629974361">Thank you both (Craig & Richard) for your replys. I will make some changes to my view and knowledge about the tsuba that I have. And after more consideration and study, I will be able to determine whether a particular piece is Kagamishi or not.<br/>
<br/>
Craig, what are the titles to the 'small' Sasano books you refered to? I am always looking for new additions to my library.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again Gentlemen.<br/>
