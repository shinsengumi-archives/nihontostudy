<h3>commercial message, nihonto zuikan set for sale</h3>
by <i>bungotakadasword</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-935590585">college tuition coming due, the Bungo Man has no need for the Nihonto <br/>
Zuikan complete set ( koto and shinto revised ed ) by Ginsaku Kataoka <br/>
which features other " better class " swords.<br/>
I was told the going price for the set is about 1300.<br/>
I am asking 1200 + shipping  ( actual cost, but could runs to about <br/>
50+, the books are heavy ).<br/>
 I will be attending the Chicago show this coming week and buyer is <br/>
welcome to pick them up at the show, in that case shipping is free.<br/>
<br/>
At the moment I will limit the sale to USA only as shipping  heavy <br/>
books oversea  is a bit$#@ and I don't need extra headache about <br/>
tracking, insurance, how come it takes so long etc.etc.<br/>
Please contact off list........... danke.<br/>
p.s.  condition is very good, the original cardboard case are  a bit <br/>
worn but not torn, some old grease stains resembling double <br/>
cheeseburger .<br/>
