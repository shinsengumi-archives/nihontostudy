It's one of the nanban types.  That style with the cupped shape and nunome zogon is often labeled Hizen.  I don't recall seeing one made with two-layer construction like that, though.  Does the other plate just cover the flat area, or does it follow the cup all of the way to the rim?<br/>

Interestingly, when I looked I thought Namban too. Very odd looking piece.<br/>
Certainly has the color and design quality one expects from Namban.<br/>

It's rather like a saucer. Flat on the other side, with the rim turned up. No detail at all on this side.<br/>

My best guess is that maybe it was easier to raise the rim from a thin sheet and the second sheet w/o cup rim was added for extra thickness.    ?<br/>
<br/>
Laminations aside, I have seen both flat cup guards like this and ones that are hemispherical like some European guards.  Oddly any of these that I've seen mounted or with hitsuana have had the convex side toward the tsuka, in the opposite orientation of a European guard.   <br/>

Interesting observation.  I don't think I've seen nunome on Tibetan guards either, but I can't claim to have looked at many.  Are they typically multi-plate construction?<br/>
<br/>
It's at: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://pictures.care2.com/view/1/743171541">http://pictures.care2.com/view/1/743171541</a>  photo's 1 & 2.<br/>
<br/>
Come to think of it I've seen Chinese guards with a square-profile cup shape.  I don't think that they had a Japanese-shaped nakago ana or marks from seppa wear, though.<br/>
<br/>
The rectangular pattern on the seppa dai and the style of nunome on the rim seem like typical Hizen traits.  Of course they were working with foreign styles.<br/>
