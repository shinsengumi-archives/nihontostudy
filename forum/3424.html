The second picture reinforces my earlier expressed opinion - note the bad ware<br/>
at the yokote (a crack, heaven forbid), while the poorly polished kissaki<br/>
suggests that the boshi "runs out".  The only change I would make to my earlier<br/>
expressions is that the sword could be (could be!!) Sue Koto.  However, from<br/>
what I can see the sword is still "no chop"and the nakago suggests this sword is<br/>
o-suriage mumei!!!  Which reinforces the observation that a poor sword is a poor<br/>
sword whenever it was made.  Here I must say that I'm talking about the Sword as<br/>
Art, not whether it is a good cutter on the Sengoku Jidai battlefield.  Given<br/>
all this, IMHO the red-lacquered inscription is of academic interest only...<br/>
<br/>

<h3>Katana/nagamaki and blade inscriptiion - Harry..where are you?</h3>

I appreciate the comments. My photography was horrible on this one..I<br/>
had 5 minutes in bad light. The boshi is intact and healthy. No hagire<br/>
anywhere. The polish is a nasty semi-amateur job that makes it look<br/>
worse then it is. The sword is actually very nice. In person, the<br/>
hamon is clear and has some activity. Lines are sharp and clean.<br/>
Yes..I agree it looks o-surige. Some opinions have been that it is a<br/>
nagamaki naoshi shortened and reshaped in shinshinto or shinto times,<br/>
and the inscriptions were done at that time. <br/>
They seem to be in the Chinese style of writing, and boast about the<br/>
sharpness of the sword. Would be very interested in a translation from<br/>
Harry, as I am told he is familiar with this type of language.<br/>
This one you have to hold in hand to appreciate. Nothing fantastic,<br/>
but has a nice sugata and nice lines. Fairly thick. I will try next<br/>
time to do better shots of the whole blade, and give dimensions.<br/>
Thanks for the comments and views. Much appreciated.<br/>
<br/>
