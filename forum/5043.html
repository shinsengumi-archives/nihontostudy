<h3>Fake sword</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-389230928">I was one of those militaria colleors who recently has been caught up <br/>
on the Ebay site. I didn't do my homework...shame on me....I recently <br/>
purchased what I thought was a Japanese shin gunto sword navy 1937. But <br/>
when it arrived from China (first hint) and the more I looked at it I <br/>
believe its a fake. So where do I start on getting pics of a real <br/>
sample of one of these to dispute the purchase.<br/>
<br/>
thanks</div>

Sorry to hear that. Good luck trying to dispute. <br/>
I don't think the seller will respect anything <br/>
resembling our standard conditions, or even <br/>
eBay's, though. So, I hope you didn't pay too much.<br/>
<br/>
This is a good starting point on gunto info: <br/>

And here's another good source: <br/>

Best of luck...<br/>
