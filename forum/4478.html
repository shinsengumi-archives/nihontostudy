<div id="ygrps-yiv-1479894927">Hello,<br/>
<br/>
does anybody know what has happened to Don Myra's Gaijin Sword<br/>
Polishing Webpage? It seems to have been deleted.<br/>
<br/>
Also I had tried to reach Don by e-mail but my mails keep on getting<br/>
bounced back. If anyone knows what has happened to Don or been in<br/>
touch with him recently please kindly let me know!<br/>
<br/>
Thank you,<br/>
<br/>
