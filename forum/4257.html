     If you sign up for their member's only page they have several <br/>
very high end pieces including a Soumin Futatokoromono, the menuki <br/>
which exhibit exactly the post arangement I am asking about.  As <br/>
Soumin studied under Goto masters and was one of the founders of <br/>
Machibori I find it interesting he here is using the open/closed end <br/>
posts such as the mainline Goto masters often used.  Having come <br/>
across an article by Thomas B. Buttweiler, 'The History of Pre-Edo <br/>
Menuki', Token TaiKai 1976, on pp. 62 & 63 the following is noted:<br/>
<br/>
     "By the end of the Dolmen Period the Tsuka ornaments had been <br/>
modified to function as Mekugi.  Because of the constraints placed on <br/>
Menuki, the size was reduced and the design became rounded and more <br/>
compact.  These first Menuki were made to be an integral part of the <br/>
Mekugi.  The solid pin of one Menuki extended through the Mekugi-Ana <br/>
of the sword and was capped on the other side of the Tsuka by the <br/>
hollow cylindrical pin of the matching Menuki.  This hollow-solid <br/>
cylindrical arrangement remained standard in the Goto School for five <br/>
hundred years after the Menuki ceased to be an integral part of the <br/>
Mekugi.<br/>
<br/>
     By the end of the Nara Period the wrapped Tsuka came into common <br/>
use.  This inovation sounded the death knell of the integral Mekugi-<br/>
Menuki.  Since the tight wrapping allowed virtually no space between <br/>
adjacent turns, the Mekugi-Menuki had to be mounted over the Tsuka-<br/>
Ito.  The softness of the wrap allowed the pins to move relative to <br/>
one another.  The subsequent metal to metal wear, resulted in loss of <br/>
adhesion, with the possible disappearance of one Menuki.  An <br/>
alternate method of external mounting was attempted.  This consisted <br/>
of mounting the two Menuki on an independent wooden Mekugi.  The <br/>
mounting was accomplished using a hollow cylindrical pin in each <br/>
Menuki, to fit over the Mekugi proper.  This approach was doomed to <br/>
failure for the same reasons stated earlier.  The double hollow <br/>
cylindrical pin arrangement, remained as a vestige of this mounting <br/>
technique, until the Muromachi Period, in the Ezo School.<br/>
<br/>
     These two attempts at using externally mounted Menuki, either <br/>
attached to or made part of the Mekugi, can only be classed as <br/>
transitional.  From a functional standpoint they were doomed to <br/>
failure from the onset.<br/>
<br/>
     Even though the Menuki could not be mounted as part of the <br/>
mekugi, tradition dictated that the Menuki be retained.  They were <br/>
inserted under the wraps using the rather feeble justifiaction that <br/>
their use improved the warriors grip on the sword.<br/>
<br/>
     Aside from the debate over the dubious functionality of wrapped <br/>
Menuki, they had, by the end of the Heian Period, become an <br/>
established member of the compliment of Kodogu.  Their status has <br/>
remained, except for variation of motif, unchanged up to the present <br/>
day".<br/>
<br/>
     I still have to wonder if there is a known justification for the <br/>
inclusion of this arrangement or if it is simply a nod to tradition?</div>

work, if you have any other browser, then it probably won't work. If <br/>
anyone can get it to work on Firefox, please let me know.<br/>
