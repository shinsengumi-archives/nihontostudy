>David et al-<br/>
>       O'neill and Nelson are about all you need. Sword books and<br/>
>kodogu references tend to follow simple rules and if you learn to<br/>
>recognize a handful of "signpost" kanji you'll be able to navigate<br/>
>them and glean much of the info.<br/>
>       With sword signatures saku or tsukuru are usually preceeded<br/>
>by the two characters of the smiths name (you'll need O'neill).<br/>
>Kuni,ju and (no)Kami are preceeded by place names, usually two<br/>
>characters (in the Nelson indecies). The character shu is usually<br/>
>part of the "Chinese" name of a province (also found in the Nelson<br/>
>indecies). nen, tsuki,hi(jitsu) and dai are usually preceeded by<br/>
>numbers, the year, month, day and generation respectively. Of course<br/>
>nen can follow a zodaiacal character like year of the rat, year of<br/>
>the tiger, (these characters are also found in the indecies).<br/>
>       Most descriptions follow sugata, jigane, hamon, nakago and<br/>
>background. It is in the background that one can get lost as these<br/>
>are usually given in regular Japanese, not "swordspeak." Even then if<br/>
>you can learn to recognize dai, jidai, nen, kuni, den, (ryu)ha,<br/>
>deshi, and mon, you can get a lot out of what seem undecipherable<br/>
>paragraphs. Mon by the way means gate, Masatsune mon would translate<br/>
>"Masatsune school", as in "he studied within the gate of Masatsune"<br/>
>or "in the Masatsune school". Often rendered as "student of" it can<br/>
>mean that he may not have been a direct student but was a product of<br/>
>that group, if it was a large school or the relationship isn't clear.<br/>
>       For tsuba the signatures follow similar rules though one<br/>
>encounters a wider use of GO or art names. Regular dictionaries don't<br/>
>really help there, I suggest Haynes or the Kinko Meikan. The<br/>
>descriptions usually follow Subject, shape, plate, engraving and<br/>
>inlay. So look for zu,sugata,ita,hori and zogan, knowing the terms<br/>
>from glossaries you'll quickly start to recognize the kanji as they<br/>
>are repeated in many listings.<br/>
>       In general I think reading swordspeak, learning to read<br/>
>swordspeak is easy, learn the hiragana and a handful of kanji and you<br/>
>can get a lot out of those books. Please bear in mind I type all this<br/>
>not for you as I am sure you know much of this already, rather it is<br/>
>intended for those the list that might be having similar troubles...<br/>
