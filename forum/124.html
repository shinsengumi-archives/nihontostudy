These were made for use.  What makes Oyamazumi so interesting is that the early swords and armor preserved there were practical items that were in use before being given to the shrine.  Many of the blades are full of chips and pits and most of the koshirae are very simple and/or in degraded condition.  These are pieces are rare remainders of what was for the most part used up and discarded long ago.<br/>

Some very long blades were made for devotional reasons, however others in Nanbokucho and early Muromachi were intended for use.  Obviously they were not drawn from the saya like katana.  I suspect that they may have been carried more for intimidation value than for effectiveness as a battlefield weapon, but I'll have to defer to Tom and the other swordsmen on that.  I suppose that they are not so different from a long pole arm.<br/>

The drawing came out of a 1930s publication that did not identify the<br/>
source.  Judging from the drawing style, I would date it much much later<br/>
than the period when O-dachi was in fashion, perhaps even as late as some<br/>
1930s artist.<br/>

I have a pictures of a Samurai utilizing a O-dachi to cut the breast <br/>
of a horse in battle. Could this be used to dismount the rider. Fact <br/>
or fiction???<br/>

Re o-dachi,I remember a piece in the National Geo about fifteen years <br/>
ago about the amazing disappearing Pacific tuna, including the sushi <br/>
favorite, bluefin.  A number of big bluefin were shown kayoed on a <br/>
Japanese distributor's floor with the bidding about to start, with <br/>
the note that they could go for up, to $5k a pop.  A sidebar story <br/>
had to do with bluefin cutting katana, about five foot nagasa, made <br/>
in semi-traditional manner (seems they were quench hardened <br/>
or "tempered", though possibly not fold forged, and likely not of <br/>
tamahagane), the heat treatment which resulted in the "loss" of one <br/>
every now and then.  So it seems that even now, o-dachi live.  "The <br/>
right tool for the right job."<br/>

  Those two are from Oyamazumi on Omishima.  The scan is from a catalog of their swords and koshirae.  There is a little more info on Oyamazumi in a draft article that I posted here:<br/>
