Many thanks for the input. I am aware of the sanjo in boston but I don't <br/>
have the book and cannot find a way in on line. Any chance that you could <br/>
send me a copy of the scan of your sword or the one in boston if you have a <br/>

These look pretty typical so-called Mino Goto work of what I like to call average-good quality. There are some made much lower quality and then some that are a step above these. Notice the rounded punchings around the nakago-ana; your tsuba has three at top and seven at the bottom. Most of these kind have these punchings but I seem to recall most have five at the bottom, not seven. I'm not so sure if anyone has ever come up with a reliable answer as to the meaning of these punchings but certainly, these Mino-Goto works do carry them. Age? I think these are still considered middle Edo works, but correct me if I'm wrong. Your fittings do look very nice.<br/>

It seems like your impression has its followers. Someone on Rich Turners <br/>
message board agreed on Mino Goto, and they are probably made from the <br/>
same hand. However he also said the set had been cleaned and should be <br/>
repatinated by an expert. I don’t see the damage but what do I know.:)<br/>
I decided to take photos of the menukis as well. However they do not <br/>
seem to match the rest of the fittings. What is your opinion on them?<br/>

These are often referred to as Nagoya-mono.  It's a kind of shiiremono that<br/>
copied Mino/Goto style.  These fittings are often marketed as "Mino Goto,"<br/>
but the quality of the materials and workmanship is not at that level of<br/>
work.<br/>
<br/>
The problem is not that they have been cleaned, but that they are not made<br/>
out of shakudo.  This type of fitting is often coated with a thin black wash<br/>
to simulate shakudo, but that is often worn away from the seppa dai.  The<br/>
nanako is more coarse than would be seen in genuine Mino or Goto work.<br/>
Rather than using gold inlay/overlay a thin gold wash is used.  Where this<br/>
is rubbed on the high spots the underlying copper shows through.  The<br/>
quality of the carving is not at the level Mino or Goto work.<br/>
<br/>
As Ron says there is a continuum of this type of material ranging from very<br/>
poor to pretty good.  The distinction between lower quality Mino-bori and<br/>
higher quality Nagoya-mono can be pretty fuzzy.<br/>
<br/>
I doubt that the fuchigashira and tsuba are by the same person.  The details<br/>
of the carving of the peony  are quite different.  They are the same type of<br/>
work though.  They're probably from the late Edo period.  There are quite a<br/>
few wakizashi mounted with this style of tosogu.<br/>

Yes, the menuki are totally different than the Mino Goto other fittings. The <br/>
one menuki depicts a "tengu" mask and the other (I think) a "wisk." Somebody <br/>
else might know the association between these. I've always like this "long <br/>
nosed tengu" and have a mask on the wall of my sword room. Story has it that <br/>
if you become a "know it all" and kind of an "instant expert" with your <br/>
swords (not wanting to study or listen to your peers) your nose will grow <br/>
like the "long nose tengu." Neat, eh? Of course I have to explain that story <br/>
when a new female visitor is around, least she get the wrong impression and <br/>
think I'm a dirty old man.<br/>
<br/>
Menuki look pretty "late" but interesting.<br/>

The other menuki is a sho with a side-blown flute depicted behind it.  The<br/>
sho a mouth-blown reed instrument used in bugaku/gagaku (along with that<br/>
type of flute, drums, etc.).  Masks are used in bugaku, some with<br/>
exaggerated noses, but I don't know whether a tengu mask like that was used.<br/>
<br/>
Several books mention that the bugaku mask depicting the shinto god<br/>
Sarutahiko no Mikoto is frequently confused with a tengu.  I think he's more<br/>
of a big wide-nosed rather than long-nosed type, though.<br/>

Hi Jim, Ron,<br/>
I was thinking of " sho ", but on second thought I think that could be a  <br/>
feather fan.<br/>
I have seen woodblock prints with the tengu holding a feather fan.<br/>
I could be wrong ( most of the time it seems )<br/>

Nice story Ron, no doubt the females will enjoy it..:)<br/>

Looking at the menukis again i wonder if there is a lesson to be learned <br/>
regarding the amount of gold foil removed. I do understand that the <br/>
placements of the menukis are such as they are exposed to a lot of wear, <br/>
but still the loss is significant. Is this always expected or could it <br/>

I don't think that the menuki were covered with gold foil.  It again looks<br/>
like just a thin gold wash.  It doesn't take much wear to go through it.  I<br/>
don't know if it's the lighting, but both pair of menuki have an odd pink<br/>
color to the exposed copper.  I've seen that on pieces that have been<br/>
