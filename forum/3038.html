<h3>NTHK origami</h3>
by <i>davidzincavage</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-864476367">I have an NTHK origami on which the ink of many of the characters has fallen off, making it hard(er) to read.  I do not know which NTHK this one is from.  It is for a tsuba, and is numbered 205008.  Can one contact the NTHK (of one of which I am a member) and obtain from them a replacement?<br/>

The kanteisho is from the Nihon Tosogu Kenkyu Kai, dated Heisei 17.<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone have a contact in that organization?<br/>

<h3>Metal same!?!</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-646325180">Hi all,<br/>
I bought myself a katana, which Barry has very kindly taken his time to <br/>
discuss it with me.<br/>
Thank you Barry!<br/>
I was suggested that I should see if the people on the list might give <br/>
some information about the metal same which is fitted on the tsuka. I <br/>
would like any information you might be willing to share.<br/>
 <br/>
Single picture (for dialers)<br/>
