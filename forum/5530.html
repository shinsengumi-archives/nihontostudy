<h3>NAKATA SUKEHORI GUNTO</h3>
by <i>pixwords2002</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-208549652">hello -<br/>
<br/>
 I'm new to nihonto, so please be kind! <br/>
<br/>
 I've acquired an interesting shin gunto with the following traits:  <br/>
<br/>
- tang signed nakata sukehori, according to fred. weissberg <br/>
- black lacquered (not painted) wooden saya with field cover in fine pigskin; ink stamps <br/>
inside<br/>
- a fine mirror-polish blade with good, continuous ("active"?) hamon<br/>
- tsuba hole for the release button, but button missing; (the circular piece above the<br/>
grip is late-war and lacks this feature)<br/>
- grip has typical  WWII furniture.<br/>
<br/>
so some basic questions::<br/>
<br/>
* what's the chance that this is the "old" goto sukehori and not nakata?<br/>
* how to distinguish machine-made from hand-made blade?<br/>
* why would sukehori sign a machine-made blade?<br/>
*  with an 8-power loupe I detect no "grain." proof of a machine-made blade?<br/>
*  the very edge of the blade seems to have sharpening (very thin - ca. 1/16").  Is this<br/>
as I hope the original edge? <br/>
* could the saya be an old one since it's lacquered?<br/>
* since the grip still has the sharkskin, safe to assume it's late but not VERY late war<br/>
(when fishskin was abandoned)?<br/>
* the field cover seems to have shrunk over the saya. I'd like to see the scabbard in its <br/>
glory. but -  best leave alone?<br/>
* are the stamps in the saya cover more likely inspectors' or owner's?<br/>
<br/>
many thanks for the patience and help with these queries!<br/>
<br/>
I'll try to load a few pix....</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1200180037">Impossible to comment without good pictures of what you refer to. If <br/>
you see no grain in the hada it is certainly an indication it is <br/>
machine made, if the polish is good enough to tell. The hamon of a <br/>

Focus your pics on the nakago and mei for appraisal. Fred knows his <br/>
stuff so he is probably right. John<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1900837622">many thanks!  it seems, regarding grain, that some was extremely  <br/>
tight and "un-obvious" so to speak.  will load targeted pix shortly I  <br/>
hope...<br/>
<br/>
fred, as well, is a very helpful man, and generous with his time.<br/>

cheers,<br/>

I wonder if perhaps the signature isn't Sukehiro, and Sukehori is a simple typo.<br/>

hello -<br/>
<br/>
I'm new to nihonto, so please be kind! <br/>
<br/>
I've acquired an interesting shin gunto with the following traits: <br/>
<br/>
- tang signed nakata sukehori, according to fred. weissberg <br/>
- black lacquered (not painted) wooden saya with field cover in fine pigskin; ink stamps <br/>
inside<br/>
- a fine mirror-polish blade with good, continuous ("active"?) hamon<br/>
- tsuba hole for the release button, but button missing; (the circular piece above the<br/>
grip is late-war and lacks this feature)<br/>
- grip has typical WWII furniture.<br/>
<br/>
so some basic questions::<br/>
<br/>
* what's the chance that this is the "old" goto sukehori and not nakata?<br/>
* how to distinguish machine-made from hand-made blade?<br/>
* why would sukehori sign a machine-made blade?<br/>
* with an 8-power loupe I detect no "grain." proof of a machine-made blade?<br/>
* the very edge of the blade seems to have sharpening (very thin - ca. 1/16"). Is this<br/>

* since the grip still has the sharkskin, safe to assume it's late but not VERY late war<br/>

glory. but - best leave alone?<br/>
* are the stamps in the saya cover more likely inspectors' or owner's?<br/>
