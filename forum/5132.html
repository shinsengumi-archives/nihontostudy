<h3>Shin-Gunto Opinions</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1830057859">Hi group,<br/>
<br/>
I will leave it to the moderator to decide if this message is <br/>
appropriate for the group, as it's more of a militaria than art sword <br/>
question.<br/>
Anyway, I need the groups help on a shin-gunto sword that is needed <br/>
for a WWII display and I thought you would certainly be well <br/>
qualified.<br/>
I've enclosed links to some pics which will help. <br/>
My studies of this type sword are limited, but this example seems to <br/>
match up well as authentic. However, with all of the repros being <br/>
produced I want to be as sure as I can before any purchase.<br/>
My concern with this particular sword is the excessive amount of text <br/>
seen on the nakago. I have never seen a published example with so much<br/>
writing. It almost appears overdone on purpose so as to make the <br/>
piece look authentic.<br/>
Would appreciate the group's opinion on this and any other aspects of <br/>
the sword that may look suspicious to you.<br/>

Interesting sword! I am not with my library at the moment, but this<br/>
certainly should meet anybody's definition of shin-gunto suitable for a<br/>
WWII display. Smith was a person named Katsumura Masakatsu. He appears to<br/>
have had/claimed a traditional title (hitatchi no suke??)and an honorary<br/>
affiliation (minamoto). The nengo is way cool. Looks like he made it in<br/>
1935 to commemorate the 2600 anniversary of the founding of the imperial<br/>
line  - which did not occur until 1940. VERY patriotic. Way cool.<br/>
This sword might get more traction on the Token list.<br/>
Thanks for the posting. This looks like a very nice sword.<br/>

Yeah, well, I was wrong on the 1935 date. This sword is dated 1940 - just<br/>
like it should be. Sorry about that. As an archeologist I am interested the<br/>
2600 dates. At least some archeologists got in trouble for questioning the<br/>
mythical creation story, so the idea that somebody was beating that drum in<br/>
1935 caught my eye. Unfortunately, the actual number - Showa 15 - did NOT<br/>
equally catch my eye.<br/>
1940 not 1935!<br/>
