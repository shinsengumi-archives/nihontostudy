<h3>tsuba value ?</h3>
by <i>matthewhoyle2000</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1510200998">Hi gang,<br/>
 <br/>
I was wondering how the size of a tsuba affects it's value. All things<br/>
being equal, would a 2.8 inch diam tsuba be worth less than say an<br/>
identical 3.5 inch one ? Or even a 4 inch one ?<br/>
 <br/>
also when is a tsuba considered to be of wakizashi or katana size ? and<br/>
would that affect the price as well ?<br/>
 <br/>
thanks for listening !<br/>

 What an interesting question! I think that as a general rule the notion<br/>
of size and value, other things being equal, except in the restricted<br/>

not an operational comparison. Tsuba size choices of the artisan were<br/>
determined by the parameters of the blade and koshirae appropriate to the<br/>
period of initial manufacture. What make tsuba interesting and desirable<br/>
is how close the fit is what it ought to be for the time of manufacture.<br/>
If one follows Sasano sensei, for example, with respect to the earliest<br/>
tosho tsuba, the early ones were small and the later ones as a rule were<br/>
larger. Even though the designs might be quite similar, the criterion of<br/>
originality and probable scarcity ought to yield a significantly higher<br/>
price for the older but smaller piece. Mutatis mutandis the same argument<br/>
holds for tsuba of different types and periods. How close the fit between<br/>
the piece at hand and the ideal type is probably the main determinant of<br/>
value. For a short answer I do not believe that there is a correlation<br/>
merely between size and market value. My two cents worth anyway.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1763627480">Hi Arnold,<br/>
 <br/>
Very interesting. Was there any particular reason why the older tsuba<br/>
are smaller ? <br/>
 <br/>
I have come up with 4 ideas<br/>
 <br/>
1. Maybe the swords were shorter, so had a smaller tsuba ? (unlikely<br/>
considering the Nambokucho monsters)<br/>
 <br/>
2. People had smaller hands back then, therefore requiring a smaller<br/>
tsuba ? (doubtful in my opinion)<br/>
 <br/>
3. The swords were better balanced at that time, think Kamakura etc,<br/>
therefore required less tsuba for balance ? (this is my favorite at the<br/>
moment together with the last one)<br/>
 <br/>
4. Since the swords were used on horseback with one arm, they had to be<br/>
light, ergo a small tsuba.<br/>

I'll disagree with one of Arnold's points, this isn't<br/>
a great question.  When I asked it a few months ago<br/>
(less than 2 I believe), it was a great question, now<br/>
it is a rehash of a topic (but I'll give you still a<br/>
relevant one).  I believe Gordon's answer given was 2<br/>
comparable tsuba with all things being equal except in<br/>
different sizes, the larger one would be worth more. <br/>
So I don't know if that is western thought or not. <br/>
But I can't speak for him.  I was curious at the time<br/>
because of 2 Mito/mito "I might not exist" shoami<br/>
tsuba I have, plus I knew that this statement applied<br/>
to swords.<br/>

There were Shoami documented working in many more locations than that.  Again, check page 246 of the Tsuba Taikan for Shoami working in Mito.  I haven't tried to slog through a translation yet.  Cary mentioned off line that he was having serious computer problems, so be patient.<br/>

<h3>papering tsuba</h3>
by <i>kdw21620</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-267169062">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
I have privately shared the 2 tsuba that spawned my<br/>
Mito questions with Jim and Cary.  Cary suggested it<br/>
would be best to submit these in Japan and it got me<br/>
thinking about many questions surrounding this<br/>
process.  I don't recall a lot of discussion around<br/>
fittings submission, but there have been many<br/>
discussions on submiting swords. So I thought it would<br/>
be helpful (for at least some of us or at least me).<br/>
1.  When is it worth submitting fittings to shinsa?  I<br/>
understand the value of knowledge but aren't fees a<br/>
little high for fittings in relation to swords? <br/>
2. Is the process similiar to swords, must submit<br/>
several times for higher papers? <br/>
2.  What criteria would you use? for example, price: a<br/>
$250 tsuba may not but a $500 would? or age a late edo<br/>
piece isn't worth it?<br/>
3.  A sword with papers usually increases value (often<br/>
greatly(?)).  How much would this apply to tsuba<br/>
and/or fittings in general?<br/>
4. What kind of conditions must your tsuba be in for a<br/>
real consideration? patina, rust, missing inlay, etc? <br/>
5. Does age factor into condition, ie koto swords may<br/>
have certain flaws overlooked in the papering process<br/>
but shinto would not, does this translate over to<br/>
tsuba?<br/>
<br/>
All comments are appreciated.  By the way, the 2 tsuba<br/>
I was questioning are located in the other yahoo list<br/>
folder under mantis (I think labeled "11 &1") which<br/>
were recently shared with on that list.  Anyone else<br/>
interested I will gladly send pics of.  <br/>
<br/>
Thank you<br/>
Ken<br/>

My feeble thoughts on the topic. I have several papered<br/>
tsuba; all purchased with papers. Papers aren't my thing.<br/>
But I do plan on submitting two or three at the next US<br/>
shinsa just to get opinions on school and age. IMHO<br/>
unless it is a matter of verifying a mei of a famous<br/>
maker; getting info is the main reason for submitting for<br/>
papers. I agree that at the current rates, especially for<br/>
the NBTHK, it is not feasible to submit anything but very<br/>
high grade fittings. The cost of the shinsa is more than<br/>
the fittings (even with papers) would be worth in most cases.<br/>
Just my humble $0.03 worth (to allow for inflation)<br/>

This seems to be the situation today with the doubling of NBTHK shinsa costs a year or so ago. Today, I would only submit a tsuba to shinsa if the signature was important enough to make the tsuba "valuable" enough to justify the costs. One tsuba here that I'm considering sending to shinsa is mumei but if judged "Akasaka" and perhaps designated to a particular generation, in my eyes, it would justify the cost of shinsa. Bob Benson mentioned awhile back that a lot of people are acquiring only Hozon papers and not bothering with paying for Tokubetsu shinsa, simply to "confirm" the mei. <br/>

  My feeble thoughts on the topic. I have several papered<br/>
  tsuba; all purchased with papers. Papers aren't my thing.<br/>
  But I do plan on submitting two or three at the next US<br/>
  shinsa just to get opinions on school and age. IMHO<br/>
  unless it is a matter of verifying a mei of a famous<br/>
  maker; getting info is the main reason for submitting for<br/>
  papers. I agree that at the current rates, especially for<br/>
  the NBTHK, it is not feasible to submit anything but very<br/>
  high grade fittings. The cost of the shinsa is more than<br/>
  the fittings (even with papers) would be worth in most cases.<br/>
  Just my humble $0.03 worth (to allow for inflation)<br/>

an alternative to sending to NBTHK shinsa ( postage/insurance, agent's fee, <br/>
shinsa fee etc could run to 400 just for hozon paper) is to wait for the NTHK <br/>
shinsa in LA 2004.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2072154298">Hi:<br/>
 That is any excellent set of questions. It is useful to remember that<br/>
while sword knowledge and what should be designated as what goes back at<br/>
least to the time of the first Ashikaga Shogun, knowledge of tosogu,<br/>
particularly iron tsuba, goes back no early than the late Bakumatsu era,<br/>
particularly with the writings of Akiyama and <br/>
Kawaguchi. The knowledge paradigm is a still expanding one and the<br/>
boundaries are somewhat indistinct and evolving. There can be a great<br/>
deal of controversy as to what group something falls into and wildly<br/>
different opinions as to age of manufacture, that of course hinging on<br/>
the date of the adoption and substantial spread of the use of<br/>
uchi-gatana. All one needs to do is to watch the moving time line in the<br/>
writings of the late Sasano Masayuki.<br/>
 My advice would be to be conservative in what you submit unless it is a<br/>
piece about which you have a great deal of curiosity and it being of<br/>
good workmanship, preservation and aesthetic content. On the other hand<br/>
one can not sell short the impact that papers have on the value of<br/>
fittings and the certainty with which they can be sold at a predictable<br/>
price, if that is of relevance to you.<br/>

 Thank you for that really interesting reference. I must do all this<br/>
from my head and in the back was some recollection of something done in<br/>
mid-Edo times, but I couldn't remember the title and that may be it. I<br/>
think the underlying point though is that systematic study is really<br/>
very new and I believe most retrospectives of the literature would place<br/>
the practical origin with Akiyama. It is that newness that makes all<br/>
opinions somewhat uncertain by either the category or time dimension, or<br/>
both. There are unresolved and unstable areas with respect to swords<br/>
too, but they are more in the way of skirmishes, rather than battles.<br/>
 Thanks again for the useful information.<br/>
