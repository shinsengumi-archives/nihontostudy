 I believe it to be a "tsukushi-naginata" , shaft inserted into metal <br/>
loop on back of the blade, quite rare and similar to the "ta-no-saki" <br/>
naginata which had a socket at the base to which a shaft was fitted, <br/>
both very different ways of mounting the shaft to the more common <br/>
naginata that we see.<br/>

筑紫 is read both chikushi and tsukushi.  The chiku kanji is an old musical instrument and the shi kanji is the color purple (murasaki).  Together the kanji are an old name of Chikuzen and Chikugo and/or of all of Kyushu.  Papinot lists a daimyo family name using these characters and says that they were taken from the village of Chikuzen.  The name of the naginata presumably refers to the place of origin.  This would have been a point of contact with China in early times.  <br/>
<br/>
Knutsen illustrates a few examples of these in his book on polearms.  He says that they were used from the late Heian through late Muromachi.  He reads it tsukushi.  Kajihara reads it chikushi in his Glossary and illustrates hirazukuri and unokubigata variations.<br/>

<h3>Sand Iron</h3>
by <i>retalt</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-888697733">All, I am looking at a Heianjô guard here, one that has been called late <br/>
Muromachi by some and maybe Edo by others. I am curious, did all the <br/>
older schools such as Heianjô use sand iron exclusively or did they mix <br/>
it up and if they did use sand iron, is it discernible by anything. My <br/>
guard has small particles on the surface, which I assume is what sand <br/>
would look like in the hira.<br/>
<br/>
Also, is sand iron something peculiar to the older times or was is use <br/>

<h3>Re: [nihontostudy] Sand Iron</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-377099238">Rich,<br/>
I can see what you're thinking, but there is no sand left in the iron after the sand-iron ore is processed.  Most Onin and many earlier Heianjo guards do have a "sandy" surface texture to the iron.  Some Kamakura-bori and Yagyu guards (Edo period, btw) do as well, although the appearance is a bit different.  I don't know what causes that surface texture.  Most Muromachi period iron guards that are believed to be made from sand iron do not have that sandy texture. <br/>
<br/>
One modern Japanese swordsmith who makes ko-tosho and ko-katchushi style tsuba on occasion told me that he uses tamahagane or ordinary modern iron in his tsuba, and that while there is a difference in the way that the iron "works" he doesn't see any outwardly visible difference in the final product.  I'm not clear on whether he used an orishigane-type process on the modern iron or just forged it as-is.<br/>
<br/>
Edo period iron guards tend to have a more homogeneous look to the iron than their "koto" counterparts.  I don't know how much of this comes from the source of the ore, the way it was smelted or how it was subsequently forged.  I think that there probably is some technical analogy with the appearance and technology of koto and shinto blades.<br/>
<br/>
Some modern swordsmiths recycle old-tech iron hinges and nails into their work.  My guess is that old smiths probably also recycled older iron, although maybe more for cost than aesthetic reasons.  It's far from clear what causes the unique differences of appearance of the iron of the major Muromachi period tsuba groups.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1493781628">Thanks Jim, That is was I was originally thinking, that the sand would <br/>
surely be processed out of the iron, but then, metalology ( ? ) is a <br/>
pretty tough thing. Maybe what I am seeing then is just an anomaly in <br/>
the irons surface, or possible as you say, maybe recycled iron, an <br/>
interesting thought and one I would expect to happen but do not give a <br/>
lot of thought too.<br/>
<br/>
I have added some links to the tsuba in question<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for taking the time and sharing your thought's Jim.<br/>
