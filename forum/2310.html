	The joke was all my doing, a lapse in judgement perhaps as some said. <br/>
I take full responsibility and I am even now communicating with Bob <br/>
about how best to apologize to the hotel staff. If anyone has <br/>
reconsidered the Chicago show as a destination, I beg you rest assured <br/>
nothing was stolen at the show.  I took charge of an item that was <br/>
forgotten by a friend of mine and meant to have some fun at his <br/>
expense, not the hotel staff or the fine folks who run the Chicago <br/>
Taikai.<br/>
