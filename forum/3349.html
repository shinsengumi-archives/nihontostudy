<h3>Yoshitake wakizashi with picture of owner</h3>
by <i>jswords03</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-473673220">Dear All<br/>
<br/>
I bought a wakizashi this week.  It is a 54.9 cm (21 5/8 inch)that is<br/>
bout of polish with chips in the ha (sure hope they are not to deep).<br/>
<br/>
The blade is signed Heianjo ju Fujiwara Yoshitake.<br/>
<br/>
There are a number of things that make this an interesting sword.<br/>
<br/>
1. The shingunto mounts have been lacquered the dark green often seen<br/>
	on the army mounts but this lacquer is painted over same and a <br/>
	wood saya.  The same is lifting way from the wood so you can<br/>
	see the method of construction.<br/>
    I knew that kai-gunto had lacquer over same but not shin-gunto.<br/>
    <br/>
Has anyone seen this type of construction on a shin-gunto?<br/>
<br/>
2. There is a silver (silver like) metal star on the tassle.  I have <br/>
	never seen anything attached to tassles. <br/>
<br/>
Has anyone seen a star on a tassle?  What might it mean???<br/>
<br/>
3. When I went to pick up the sword.  The wife of the gave me a picture.<br/>
	She said that her late husband did not talk much about his time<br/>
	during WWII but she pointed to the person standing in the back <br/>
	row to the right (looks like army uniform) and said that was<br/>
	the owner of the blade.<br/>
<br/>
CAn anyone translate what is written on the back of the picture?<br/>
<br/>
You can see images at<br/>
<br/>
	<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.montanairon.com/swords.html">http://www.montanairon.com/swords.html</a><br/>
<br/>
	then click on #7 Images to view and it will the the top sword.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any help.<br/>
<br/>
later<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2140191896">Many years ago I saw a shingunto with brown lacquered same.  The blade had a<br/>
huge chip in it so I passed.  I do wish now that I had bought it for the<br/>
koshirae.<br/>
<br/>
More recently a friend bought a Satsuma Tadashige (Sukehiro's No. 2 pupil)<br/>
katana in a shingunto koshirae with a brown lacquered same saya.  Brilliant.<br/>
<br/>
I'll look at your pictures later.  Congratulations, I believe it is a great<br/>
find.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-636950278">Dear Barry<br/>
<br/>
I have seen the shingunto mounts where they look like the kaigunto and <br/>
have the same<br/>
lacquered and then sanded to show the white round nodules.<br/>
<br/>
But the same on my sword has not been sanded and the lacquer totally <br/>
covers the same and you have a<br/>
nice nashiji (spelling??) surface. Makes me wonder if all of the early <br/>
shingunto have same under the<br/>
lacquer.<br/>
<br/>
Have you seen a tassel with a silver star?<br/>
<br/>
And why would a wakizashi be mounted in shingunto mounts?<br/>
