<br/>
I posted on the NMB some books for sale.  Might as well advertise them here.<br/>
<br/>
Tosogu No Kansho by Masayuki Sasano (1982).  A great reference book with  <br/>
English descriptions and nice photography of both iron and kinko  tosogu.  A <br/>
very good reference to have in your library. <br/>

Token  Kakaku Jiten by Iido (1971).  I am not sure why this book is not better  <br/>
known but this japanese text packs a lot of reference material.  It has  both <br/>
sword oshigato and detailed fittings signatures.  A valuable  reference not <br/>
often found.<br/>

detailed swords pictures with good mei pictures along with  nice photographs of <br/>
sword fittings, kabutos and many other items.  A  good value<br/>
