<h3>Will this Katana polish?</h3>
by <i>pcfarrar</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1363051274">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
Can anyone give me an opinion if this Katana blade would polish?<br/>
<br/>
I believe it to be a shinshinto Katana, the blade (cutting edge 26 <br/>
1/4") is very heavy and thick.<br/>
<br/>
Its badly corroded and pitted on one side of the blade, the other <br/>
side has only minor pitting and corrosion. The worst areas (deep <br/>
pitting) are pictured in the link. The blade is still very sharp <br/>
along the entire edge. The hamon is not visible at all.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any help.<br/>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2113140301">Dear Peter,<br/>
I think anyone looking at these images will tell you that this blade can<br/>
polish just fine. The shape does not seem to be highly compromised and we<br/>
have all seen blades in far worse condition come thru polish to be<br/>
beautiful. Before you decide to commit to a polish, however, I think I will<br/>
not be the only one to urge you to move slowly.<br/>
First, I'd try to do a bit of kantei. This sure does not look like a<br/>
shin-shinto to me. If it is as new as you think, then somebody has<br/>
falsified the nakago in ways that would make it hard for me to ever "like"<br/>
this blade. Its been dummied up and no matter how well it comes thru<br/>
polish, after a while I suspect that the tang will become hard to over<br/>
look. In fact, I bet this is a koto that deserves to be brought back.<br/>
Secondly, the fact that you cannot see a hamon has to be investigated. A<br/>
yakiba will typically show even when a blade is in wretched condition. If<br/>
you can't see anything - even tho you look hard - I think you have to<br/>
assume that the blade has "lost its temper." In that case, a polish would<br/>
be a total waste of your time and money. The good news is that I think your<br/>
images DO show a tempered edge. Again, I think the blade deserves<br/>
restoration. To be sure, tho, I suggest that this is a prime candidate for<br/>
having a window opened to be sure that it is intact.<br/>
Good luck<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1365038632">A brief experience of mine in my former criminal life as an amateur <br/>
polisher (gunto only!).  I had two blades, both Pacific War era, <br/>
nearly identically rusty (i.e., very rusty, big crusts of red/black <br/>
oxide, hard to see the hamon).  One was a traditionally made blade by <br/>
Masamura, the other a Showa stamped blade by Kumemune.  As it turned <br/>
out, the pitting was very shallow on the Kumemune, but very, very <br/>
deep on the Masamura, despite the nearly identical appearance on the <br/>
surfaces of the two blades.  I couldn't get all the pitting out of <br/>
the Masamura, was just too deep, would've had to whittle the blade <br/>
down to nothing!  With the Kumemune, I had more work to do to iron <br/>
out the waves left from the original polish.  Bottom line, you can't <br/>
tell by looking (except perhaps if you are a professional polisher).  <br/>
You need to determine if it's worth the expense to have a <br/>
professional evaluate the blade and perhaps open a window to see <br/>
whether a full polish is appropriate.  FWIW.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2093652389">Hello Peter,<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Your sword is in a very bad condition and the responsible thing to say<br/>
is that it may not polish out well.  From what I can see the rust is<br/>
very deep.  The fact that it is so deep is not a good thing because a<br/>
polisher will need to go just as deep to remove it from the sword.  It's<br/>
not about having a soft hand as a polisher; it's about how deep the rust<br/>
actually is.  Going that deep in a sword can bring up fukure, shintetsu<br/>
and other flaws.  Not to mention the fact that the sword's hamon can<br/>
also get softer after going down deep like that.  The nakago was worked<br/>
on in some way, perhaps a false signature was removed?  I don't know.<br/>
In any case to me the sword looks like a Shinto blade but that's just my<br/>
humble opinion.  Now for some good news, it is very possible for swords<br/>
in this condition to polish out properly and become fine looking swords.<br/>
But just take your time, because the expense and risk involved in the<br/>
restoration of such a sword is not inexpensive.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-244637293">Hi Peter - <br/>
<br/>
Interesting to read "first thoughts" of shinshin-to, shin-to, ko-to and WWII era. Point up the fun of our chosen interest, eh? My thinking is why spend the money on a sword like this unless there is "something" there that would encourage one to look further. As Peter Bleed pointed out, the nakago has been thoroughly "drilled" but even that can be fixed (plugged) if so desired. My guess (gut feeling/impression) as to kantei would be on the fence; possibly late koto/early shinto work, leaning towards late koto.<br/>
<br/>
Fun stuff, we enjoy, eh?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-845104202">I see Moses has joined in on this thread, so I will, of course, defer <br/>
to whatever he says.  As an addendum to my earlier comments, I burned <br/>
up a Lohman polishing kit ($550) on full polishes for three gunto, <br/>
plus some minor polishes on a few others.  The Kumemune was a <br/>
pleasant surprise (crusty rust over relatively minor pitting).  The <br/>
Masamura was more typical (crusty rust over deep pitting).  This <br/>
brings me to Personal Rule #1 re pitting on rusty swords: "It is <br/>
always deeper than you think."  Even light white frosting has pitting <br/>
involved, properly requiring the use of foundation stones in my <br/>
experience.  Hence Personal Rule #2: "Never buy rusty swords."  <br/>
(Unless, of course, a sword is still a bargain with the price of a <br/>
professional polish included, which is a big roll of the dice, <br/>
considering on what may show up during a major repolish.)  JMHO.<br/>
