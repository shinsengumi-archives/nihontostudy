Just came back from the Chicago show...............<br/>
a lot of old faces were not there but the core die hard table holders <br/>
were there holding the fort.<br/>
The meibutsu exhibition , as always, is outstanding with Bob Benson <br/>
giving commentary und answer any questions put forth by the <br/>
attendees. This year's exhibition was on " Yamato blades ".  Also <br/>
there was a tsuba exihition on Kyo-sukashi tsuba.<br/>
 <br/>
Even though the attendance was noticably lower than previous years, I <br/>
noticed a heightened level of activities among dealers, <br/>
collectors/table holders. A lot of horse tradings took place to <br/>
everyone's advantage.   I personally sold   quite a few tsuba und <br/>
done a few trades which I am very happy with. There's no last minutes <br/>
firehouse sales as the prices were set quite low to begin with, so if <br/>
you have cash, many good deals were possible.<br/>
A fellow listeros had a great display of his personal collection of <br/>
Christian theme tsuba................ simply OUTSTANDING !!!!!!!! he <br/>
corned the market on that theme !!!!!<br/>
 <br/>
Roy H. had a display of an outstanding  tachi koshirae that used to <br/>
belong to gen. Sugiyama und a very nice display of HIGH QUALITY tauba <br/>
( among them  a Hoan tsuba that made some people hyperventilate ).... <br/>
in short, a mini Meibutsu room display  right there in the room for <br/>
all to see through out the show.<br/>
If you are in the Mid West region und missed the <br/>
event................. arrrrrrhhhhhh, you missed a great  show.<br/>
 <br/>
A great event is already being planned for next year but since it's <br/>
in the planning stage, i can't tell you what it is.  Stay <br/>
tuned...........................<br/>
