Ebay will take them down in 24 hours.<br/>
<br/>
There is only one reason that Ebay doesn't go after these guys in a much<br/>
harder fashion. They're accomplices to the sale. Every fake sold means<br/>
money in Ebay's pocket. If you turn on the lights while the thief and<br/>
his accomplice are robbing your house, the accomplice suddenly turns<br/>
into a vigilante and is glad to help you catch the thief... <br/>
<br/>
That's the one and only reason Ebay doesn't do anything about it.<br/>
<br/>
On the flip side of the coin...<br/>
<br/>
There is a saying, "It's impossible to cheat an honest man."<br/>
<br/>
Everyone on Ebay wants to get a steal. They want to buy your item for<br/>
less than it is worth, and if you ask a fair price few will go to<br/>
you. They will flock to those that appear to be offering discounted<br/>
items though, often times cutting deals outside of ebay, and all they do<br/>
is screw themselves. Their own greed means they end up with these<br/>
valueless pieces of junk. <br/>
<br/>
Even armed with a little information, if they see someone who doesn't<br/>
appear to know what they're selling, how many of them send an email and<br/>
say, "Hey dude, that junky violin you found in your grandpa's attic is<br/>
really a Stradivarius. You should get it authenticated and sell it at<br/>
Sotheby's, pay off your mortgage and be able to send your kid to a good<br/>
university."<br/>
<br/>
Very few.<br/>
<br/>
So when you go out of your way to inform them, often times you take away<br/>
the mystery and the treasure hunting mentality takes them<br/>
elsewhere. Right into the hands of the scammers.<br/>
<br/>
They want to buy something from you of extreme value, and not pay for<br/>
it. So they find someone who looks like they're providing this to them. <br/>
<br/>
It's not only with swords, but it's with diamonds... other gemstones,<br/>
watches, everything. I sold some gold coins once, and I had no end of<br/>
people offering to do me a favor and give me 20% *less* than the market<br/>
price of gold if I would sell to them now and end the auction.<br/>
<br/>
Gold is the one thing that has a well understood value in the world, and<br/>
even on ebay auctions will end at the market price of gold<br/>
consistently. The price of gold is less a reflection on the value of<br/>
gold then it is on the value of paper money. <br/>
<br/>
These people were effectively offering me 80 cents if I would give them<br/>
a dollar bill. There is no mentality there for a fair deal, just a hope<br/>
that they can get something for less than it is valued.<br/>
<br/>
For both reasons above, junk will continue to be put on ebay and the<br/>
auctions will be well attended. People will buy first and ask questions<br/>
later. And ebay will turn a blind eye to everything.<br/>

Yes,, you are right.<br/>
An auction is an auction if it is Ebay or Sothebys/Christies.<br/>
Anyway.... it is a pitty for the people who want to buy or sale <br/>
items.<br/>
