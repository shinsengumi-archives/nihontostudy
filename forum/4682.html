<div id="ygrps-yiv-2129861245">Dear Elliott<br/>
<br/>
Your general question re the use of casting tecniques for the <br/>
production of tsuba, although probably asked in all innocence, opens a <br/>
whole 'can of worms'.<br/>
<br/>
There is no doubt that casting was accepted as a skilled form of <br/>
metalworking and was used to produce cast bronze vessels and mirrors, <br/>
and iron kettles.  Indeed, a cast kagami is one of  the Three Sacred <br/>
Regalia of Japan.  Kagami-shi tsuba, supposedly made in the pre-Edo <br/>
period by mirror makers, may also be of extremely high quality and it <br/>
is not illogical to suppose that many soft-metal tsuba may have <br/>
initially been cast.<br/>
<br/>
But the casting of iron tsuba is, for some reason, very frowned upon by <br/>
collectors.  I am personally convinced that the vast majority of Namban <br/>
tsuba are cast and the poor quality of many of these makes this very <br/>
easy to detect with the use, simply, of a bright light and x30 <br/>
magnification.  The ease with which casting can be identified clearly <br/>
depends upon the amount of hand finishing which was utilised afterwards.<br/>
<br/>
Many people will justify the casting of Manban tsuba as being expected <br/>
because of their poor quality, but I believe that casting may have been <br/>
used far more generally than is accepted.  It should be a simple matter <br/>
to confirm this, but such examinations would need to be carried out on <br/>
tsuba of accepted high quality in order to avoid the a priori excuse <br/>
of 'poor quality'.<br/>
<br/>
White cast iron is not a suitable metal for casting, but the <br/>
carburisation of grey cast iron to produce  a malleable cast iron, <br/>
which is ideal for casting small artefacts such as tsuba, is a process <br/>
that has been known in Japan for several hundred years.<br/>
<br/>
As to whether the tsuba illustrated in your photo album is cast or not, <br/>
I would hesitate to offer a firm opinion without a hands-on <br/>
examination.  But my first impression is the absence of any clean, <br/>
sharp chisel-work - I have my suspicions!<br/>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1354989788">Dear Rick<br/>
<br/>
You ask for evidence that the 'lost wax' method of casting was known to <br/>
the Japanese and you are, of course, quite correct in your assertion <br/>
that the typical Namban tsuba could only have been cast by using this <br/>
tecnique.  Evidence exists in Japan of the extensive use of both <br/>
the 'closed form' and the 'lost form' methods of casting - the former <br/>
being known in China as early as the Zhou dynasty (1122-249 BC) and the <br/>
latter being introduced there 'relatively late'. <br/>
<br/>
Many Japanese artefacts could only have been produced by the use of <br/>
this tecnique, and kagami are but one example of this. The detail of <br/>
many cast objects, especially in bronze, could not have been acheived <br/>
any other way.<br/>
<br/>
Thus my belif in the casting of Namban tsuba presumes the use of <br/>
a 'lost form' method.  The naked-eye evidence of casting; the knowledge <br/>
that this form as casting was widely known in Japan; and the acceptance <br/>
that no other contemporanerous method of casting could have produced <br/>
these artefacts seem to support this presumption. <br/>
<br/>
I would be interested to hear your further comments.<br/>

Well you tweeked the ego button...will post a photo or two of that nice namban early-on this week. May dig out another uniquely structured namban that I featured in an old JSS/US article years back. That one appeared to be made in two pieces and the "sides" somehow "welded" together. Never came across another like it since that time. <br/>
<br/>
Namban are really interesting tsuba and I think they just got a bad rap years ago because of so many more "common" ones being found. You see some very nice namban work turn up on Japanese sites and when in Tokyo in October, I saw several very nice examples -- high priced examples, I might add. As with all kodogu, you have lots of average quality stuff, some average-good and then the lesser found great quality works. It's what makes this study so interesting!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1972589552">How encouraging that the noticeboard has several members who are not <br/>
blindly prejudiced against Namban tsuba as a group, even if many of <br/>
these are lacking in both design and execution.  I remember my <br/>
distress some years ago when, upon being informed of my research on <br/>
the group, a senior member of the To-ken scene in GB replied Oh Dear, <br/>
but he supposed that somebody had to do it!<br/>
<br/>
The tsuba that Ron describes as being 'made in two pieces' is <br/>
probably one of many tsuba which were made in the mid-C19 for sale to <br/>
foreigners in Nagasaki.  These were made in two non-contiguous halves <br/>
that, when joined together gave the impression of undercutting.  In <br/>
the better of these they were joined by a mimi; in the others they <br/>
were simply soldered together.<br/>
<br/>
The Hozon Namban tsuba posted by Richard is very nice.  The gold <br/>
sleeves that he comments upon appear to be inserts intended to tidy <br/>
up the irregularities in the design left by the later addition (or <br/>
should I say subtraction) of the ryo-hitsu.<br/>
<br/>
Please keep them coming.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>nice namban early-on this week. May dig out another uniquely <br/>
structured namban that I featured in an old JSS/US article years <br/>
back. That one appeared to be made in two pieces and the "sides" <br/>
somehow "welded" together. Never came across another like it since <br/>
that time. <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > <br/>

 </span></blockquote>rap years ago because of so many more "common" ones being found. You <br/>
see some very nice namban work turn up on Japanese sites and when in <br/>
Tokyo in October, I saw several very nice examples -- high priced <br/>
examples, I might add. As with all kodogu, you have lots of average <br/>
quality stuff, some average-good and then the lesser found great <br/>
quality works. It's what makes this study so interesting!<br/>
