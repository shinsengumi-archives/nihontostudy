<h3>Tokugawa Daisho</h3>
by <i>schrattenholz</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1037800844">Hi all.<br/>
I had the opportunity to buy this in the spring 2004 from 2 private <br/>
collectors ( former ). I bought the Daisho set first and then the <br/>
owner had seen it on the net and then provided the tanto for sale. I <br/>
believe that it is great that all 3 pieces are together now. Maybe <br/>
that they some day may come back to The Tokugawa Museum ? Have been <br/>
looking at many websites and hae besides NihontoAntiques, as I <br/>
received very good recommendation about, - thankyou, also seen www. <br/>
artswords.com owned by Bill Rannow who have many fine things on his <br/>
site, swords as well as fittings. Does anybody know him or have <br/>
bought something from him. It looks very good to me?.<br/>
Regarding the Tokugawa, I need a little help to translate the <br/>
correct mei on the shoto which I translate as Kunifusa. <br/>
Unfortunately I can not differ from Hawleys Kun 34 - 39. I have <br/>
tried to take some good photos of the mei but have not succeeded yet <br/>
and will return for help when I have some good photos. <br/>
I learn a lot from all off you so please continue the lessons, <br/>
thankyou.<br/>
All the best<br/>
Allan</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-810449537">Hi Mike<br/>
So great of you to recommend Bill Rannows  . I am glad to hear that you have bought some fine swords from him. I am about to buy swords from him and did not at all feel anything wrong in our correspondance, only that he seems good and straight as you describe him. But I have been cheeted awful before using the net, even though I had copy of passport and drivers license. I am also new in collecting and buying on the net. Therefore I am very carefully to ask peoble with the same interest whether a seller is trustfully or not. I am very anxious to learn what I can from others but do not like to spend money for a sword and then donÂ´t get it. I wish to be aware about who are the bad guys and who are the good ones. .<br/>
<br/>
Hi Steve<br/>
Thankyou so much for the link. Will love to investigate all the beautyful photos further.<br/>
<br/>
Appreciate your help<br/>
All the best<br/>
Allan<br/>
