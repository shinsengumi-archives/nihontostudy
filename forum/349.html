<div id="ygrps-yiv-2013196558">Hey guys,<br/>
<br/>
yesterday I discovered that those digital microscopes that were made by <br/>
intel are still<br/>
available!  some company called Digital Blue is now marketing them.<br/>
<br/>
If you haven't seen one of these before, they're a cheap looking <br/>
microscope that plugs<br/>
into your USB port and go to 200X - they actually work pretty well <br/>
though the focus<br/>
knob is kind of gnarly at the higher magnifications - they have a pretty <br/>
fair depth of<br/>
field and the resolution looks fine on screen - you can also pull 'em <br/>
off the stand and<br/>
use them freehand for all kinds of macro applications.  Best of all, you <br/>
can get 'em from<br/>
amazon for $49.99 - look for digital blue QX3.<br/>
<br/>
Not as good as a top grade microscope with the camera port, but hey, it <br/>
didn't cost<br/>
3 grand either...<br/>
<br/>
Check it out...<br/>
