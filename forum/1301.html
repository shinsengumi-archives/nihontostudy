        I cannot check the Token_kenkyu list remotely, I wonder if <br/>
you will see the following gets to the approppriate list?<br/>
<br/>
All- <br/>
        Someone asked about matching a single menuki showing a brush <br/>
and inkstone. While I think trying to find the needle in the haystack <br/>
would be easier, I can at least help point you toward what to look <br/>
for.<br/>
<br/>
        There are two possible themes referred to with these items; <br/>
one is Sugarawa Michizane and the other is Tanabata. Since I can't <br/>
remember who posted the query I will assume you do not instantly <br/>
recognize these.<br/>
<br/>
        Sugawara Michizane was a famous scholar, courtier and <br/>
minister who ran afoul of certain members of the Fujiwara who smeared <br/>
his name and turned the Emperor agaisnt him. He was known to study <br/>
under the Plum trees in his garden. When he was to leave for exile in <br/>
Kyushu, he penned a now famous poem to his trees entreating them to <br/>
send their sweet Frangrance to him though he be far away. At which <br/>
point one of the trees uprooted and flew off to Kyushu and his place <br/>
of exile. So if you see plum blossoms this is the theme, and your <br/>
match might be a scroll with bits of the poem on it, or Michizane <br/>
riding an Ox, or a simple plum branch.<br/>
<br/>
        Tanabata is celebrated on the 7th day of the 7th month, in <br/>
China it is called Kikoden (Japanese reading here). The lord of the <br/>
heavens allowed his daughter to marry a simple shepard but she <br/>
behaved so badly on the wedding day that he forced them to live on <br/>
opposites sides of the Milky Way. Once a year they are allowed to see <br/>
each other when the Ama no Gawa (River of Heaven) Is bridged by a <br/>
murder of crows. The rest of the year, she spends pining to see her <br/>
husband and weaving, so is known as Ori-Hime,"Ori" means to weave. In <br/>
the Chinese tradition fresh inkstones were laid outside on "kuzu" <br/>
leaves, on top of these were laid bunches of Yam leaves to "catch the <br/>
dew". On the day of the festival celebrants would write their wishes <br/>
with the dewdrops from the river of heaven.According to Joly <br/>
this "emblematic representation of the Tanabata festival was a <br/>
familiar theme of tsuba decoration by the Umetada."<br/>
<br/>
        Since Ori-hime spends all year wishing to see her husband, <br/>
this is the one day all year when wishes are fulfilled. So the custom <br/>
is to write your wishes on colored strips of paper, since this is a <br/>
rather romantic story it is also a day for romance and love poems in <br/>
Japan. If along with the inkstone and brushes you see leaves, strips <br/>
of paper or a (weaving) shuttle then your theme is Tanabata.<br/>
<br/>
        As was suggested simple kanji might be a good match though I <br/>
couldn't find them paired "as a theme", also an ink well with it's <br/>
lid would be good. According to the Tsuba Gadai Jiten, These everyday <br/>
items are indespensable, ink and brush are inseperable. So I guess <br/>
they symbolize a well ordered world, a well rounded gentlemen¡Ä<br/>
<br/>
Hoping this helps, <br/>
