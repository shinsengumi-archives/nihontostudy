<h3>more questions..............</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1045385256">Jim thanks for the reply on the earlier post. I have more questions<br/>
though :-)<br/>
 <br/>
I just posted this on the other list as well.......... do you or any<br/>
other members of this list have insights in to this ?<br/>
 <br/>
thanks, Matthew<br/>

Friends,<br/>
 <br/>
Another concept I just ran into was that of hot or cold shortening of<br/>
blades. If a blade is shortened "hot" the hamon will end where the tang<br/>
begins whereas if it is shortened "cold" the hamon will continue into<br/>
the nakago of the suriage or osuriage sword in question. <br/>
 <br/>
Now it never occored to me there would be two ways to shorten a blade,<br/>
although now ofcourse it looks quite obvious. However I am wondering,<br/>
presuming actually, that a smith would carry out the "hot" shortening,<br/>
not the cold shortening of a blade. I don't know why but that seems to<br/>
make more sense to me........ <br/>
 <br/>
So who would shorten a blade "cold" and what advantages or disadvancages<br/>
would that have over shortening a blade "hot" ? Would it be possible to<br/>
generalize and say that one technique was used more in one period than<br/>
the other ? <br/>
 <br/>
Also when the machi are moved up on a blade would this be done hot or<br/>
cold ? <br/>
 <br/>
Just curious,<br/>
