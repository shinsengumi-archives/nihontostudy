<h3>My Mito tsuba followup</h3>
by <i>kdw21620</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-340941243">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
You all may recall a few months ago the 2 tsuba that I<br/>
had emailed about which started the whole Mito Shoami<br/>
does it exist or not thread.  I came across this last<br/>
week on a website and it is now listed on yahoojapan<br/>
auction.  <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://page7.auctions.yahoo.co.jp/jp/auction/g11105190">http://page7.auctions.yahoo.co.jp/jp/auction/g11105190</a><br/>
<br/>
Jim G said he would have attributed the larger to Mito<br/>
while the smaller to Mito Shoami.  (Here is the link<br/>
for my mantis folder in the other yahoo group list<br/>
photo area) to see the ones I am talking about<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://photos.groups.yahoo.com/group/nihonto/vwp?.dir=/mantis&.src=gr&.dnm=tsuba+11+%26+1.jpg&.view=t&.done=http%3a//photos.groups.yahoo.com/group/nihonto/lst%3f%26.dir=/mantis%26.src=gr%26.view=t">http://photos.groups.yahoo.com/group/nihonto/vwp?.dir=/mantis&.src=gr&.dnm=tsuba+11+%26+1.jpg&.view=t&.done=http%3a//photos.groups.yahoo.com/group/nihonto/lst%3f%26.dir=/mantis%26.src=gr%26.view=t</a><br/>
<br/>
I emailed the seller of this new being auctioned and<br/>
this was his response: "The 081 Tsuba was made in the<br/>
last of edo period, 19 century. And the school of<br/>
tsuba is presumed Aizu Shoami made. There is<br/>
comparatively cheap  in comparison with the quality."<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps those items we are attributing to Mito Shoami<br/>
are done by Aizu Shoami?  I know they did a lot of<br/>
mass produced, but even with that I think I read that<br/>
they did have competant metal workers?  Any comments<br/>
on these Aizu?  Perhaps they were copying the Mito in<br/>
this particular case?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.<br/>
Ken<br/>
<br/>
P.S. This one being auctioned really is tying the ones<br/>
I own together even more.  Dai-sho in the making!<br/>

The styles of Aizu Shoami and Mito are very similar IMHO.<br/>
Although I think the better, high end Mito work is a bit<br/>
superior. Both schools did a lot of copying of other<br/>
schools (Nara especially) work. Both schools produced<br/>
tons of shiriimono, but also some nice pieces. I like<br/>
the ones you've shown and hope you are able to get them.<br/>

That type of workmanship and tagane-mei are typical of the type of Nara-copy shiiremono tsuba that Bob Haynes called "Mito Shoami" in his auction catalogs.  I just flipped through the tsuba section of "Tetsu no Isho, Mito-to to Tosogu no Meihin," and I don't see that tagane-mei on any of the Mito tsuba there.  The workmanship of the two tsuba with the tagane marks looks a lot like that of the two mokko Shoami tsuba lower on the same page.<br/>

High end Mito work is in an entirely different universe from the best Aizu Shoami.  It's not really my taste, but the good Mito makers were highly skilled kinko.<br/>

There are signed Aizu Shoami tsuba.  Some of them are fairly good quality, and others are pretty poor.  It's certainly possible that the "Mito" shiiremono tsuba could be made by Aizu workers, but the workmanship is a bit different from even the low end signed Aizu work.  We're probably not going to find any signed shiiremono examples to settle the issue.  I think that Aizu Shoami is a better label than Mito Shoami, since we do have documented Shoami makers in Aizu (but not in Mito), but I'm not sure it's correct.   Ultimately, they're copying the Nara style.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Thanks Jim and Rich.  As for your above comments, I<br/>
think I have firmly established what I like.  Seperate<br/>
from these discussed pieces, I am seeking out various<br/>
other schools from the Mito Shoami type to have a<br/>
representation of all the schools that used the mantis<br/>
in their work.  My humble collection of 12 tsuba is<br/>
growing with representation of both kinko and sukashi.<br/>
I really would love to put out a book one day on just<br/>
mantis fittings.  Whoever owns that tsuba on the<br/>
Northern California site please feel free to leave<br/>
that to me in my will.  Given that however, I do like<br/>
these Mito tsuba and kinda like the idea of having a<br/>
potential dai-sho for mounting or at least 1 for<br/>
display and 1 for mounting.  Thanks again.<br/>
