<h3>I KNOW NOW I GOT FAKES</h3>
by <i>ranox27157</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-377098095">Thank you for the information, I know now I am getting fakes. I did <br/>
pay a nice sum for the shipping and insurance, and I will be <br/>
breaking contact with my "friend." But he was probably taken as <br/>
well, for he bought 13-14 swords at antique stores in Shang Hai. So <br/>
mabe it wasn't really his fault.<br/>
As far as my fakes I posted pictures of them in a photo album here. <br/>
Maybe someone can tell me of what they are fakes of? I didn't get <br/>
them for their collecting value, but for demonstrative use. I'd <br/>
still like to know a little about them. and maybe in the future <br/>
after I've learned more, buy a real one.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-955664531">Sorry that you and your friend got taken in on these.  They are just <br/>
generic fakes.  They are not a copy of any particular sword.  They are <br/>
just sort of Japanese sword shaped, and then marketed as genuine to the <br/>
unwary.  If you type in "Viking sword" on EBay, you will see lots of <br/>
modern swords that sort of look like Viking swords, but hopefully are <br/>
described as being reproductions somewhere in the description.  I doubt <br/>
if any of them is a particularly good representation of the genuine <br/>
article, either.<br/>
