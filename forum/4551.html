<h3>Gordon -- Thank you for the hard work!</h3>
by <i>klepet33319</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1555555526">I received the NBTHK AB translations of 'Elementary Course in Sword <br/>
Furniture and Fittings (128)' on Mito Kinko by Fukushi Shigeo this <br/>
morning and I can see where you were coming from in your comments on <br/>
the translation.  Work well done and much appreciated.  I have to laugh <br/>
a bit at the title 'Elementary' as it's very in depth and it really <br/>
puts into perspective how much there is to learn in this field.  Not <br/>
being able to read Japanese of course puts so much out of reach for so <br/>
many of us that work such as yours is most highly valued.  It also puts <br/>
into perspective just how much scholarship there is in what men like <br/>
Fukushi accomplish.  I will be looking forward to your future endeavors.<br/>
Pete Klein<br/>
PS:  To all -- if you are not a member of the NBTHK AB it is well worth <br/>
it, IMHO.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-994362558">Thanks Pete. Given the amount of time it takes to do this kind of  <br/>
work in relation to how much you get paid makes translation a rather  <br/>
thankless task. Getting some strokes every now and then makes it all  <br/>
worth while. So thanks for this. Next up is Higo Hirata Hikozo with  <br/>
the same kind of very in depth analysis. There is more Mito Kinko on  <br/>
the way as well.<br/>
