Does one see Senkotsu in Owari tsubas?  Does the presence of Senkotsu aid in dating?<br/>

  A thick, round rim is typical for early Akasaka guards.  Later ones tend to be thinner.  The early Akasaka really favored a very "high," rounded rim compared with other groups working at the same time.<br/>
<br/>
  Sometimes tekkotsu are seen in early examples.  Senkotsu is more common, which is a sort of long linear bone that forms where the inner and outer plates are joined.  <br/>

  I'm not sure if you intended there to be an attached photo.  The list doesn't permit attachments, but you can post images in the group photo album at:<br/>

    Dear All,<br/>
    I have been discussing the tsuba below with a number of friends from both this and another group. The concensus to date is that this is early Akasaka. While I am more than content with that attribution I was wondering how common the thick round mimi was in Aakasaka work? Also there are a lot of bones in the mimi. I understand that early Akasaka work was influenced by Owari tsuba, is this an example of this? or should I be looking in another direction.<br/>
    All comments greatly appreciated.<br/>

I can't think of seeing it in Owari work or reading of Owari guards described that way.  Owari guards can show elongated or "linear" tekkotsu when compared to Kanayama's "bumpy" tekkotsu for example, but it looks quite different from senkotsu.  Easier to show than to describe.  <br/>
<br/>
In Akasaka guards that have been rusted and cleaned, the join between the plates can be very prominent.  Most early examples will show it in some places around the rim, but not others.  Some do not show it.  Some early ones have tekkotsu, but I don't think I've ever seen a piece with both features together.  I have to wonder whether the ones with tekkotsu are the predecessors.<br/>
<br/>
I can't think of any examples of pre-Edo period work with senkotsu, so to that extent it would aid in dating.<br/>
<br/>
There are guards that show a many-layered lamination in the rim.  It looks something like a puff pastry crust.  I don't think that that feature is described as senkotsu, but it's also seen in Edo period work.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone have different observations?<br/>
