<h3>KTK catalogues</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-293492089">Hi all - <br/>
<br/>
As was mentioned earlier, I (along with other KTK members) have copies of our 2006 convention and exhibition catalogue available for sale. It looks like shipping weight when packaged will be 4 lbs. I'd prefer using priority mail (uninsured) or if wanted, media mail (but with insurance) can also be done. What I'd suggest is anyone wanting a copy from me should email me direct with your address and if you want the copy shipped priority or the slower media mail. I'll get back to you with final cost. (Catalogue costs $50 plus shipping; $4.38 insured media mail or a few bucks more, priority.)<br/>
<br/>
The 2nd Kokusai Tosogu Kai convention exhibition was held in Tokyo several weeks ago. It was a super exhibit of super fittings and koshirae held at the Takashimaya Department Store exhibition area in Tokyo. This year's catalogue is wonderful, being hard bound with slip cover and illustrations in color of high quality printing. I'll try to post some photos of the catalogue somewhere later this week but honestly, the catalogue, especially at this price, is well worth your hard earned cash! <br/>
<br/>
What I'd suggest is that anyone outside of the U.S.A. should buy a copy locally. They are available from members outside of the states. <br/>
<br/>
If you're interested in a copy email me direct: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:swords@...">swords@...</a> and give me your address. Specify if you want priority or media mail shipping and I'll quickly get back to you with the total cost including shipping. These are sold "at cost." <br/>
