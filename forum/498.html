<div id="ygrps-yiv-1173996900">Hi all - <br/>
<br/>
Just passing this info on as general info.  <br/>
<br/>
My provider service installed something this weekend to block spam from coming though to his customers.  I discovered that all of my email from both Yahoo chat groups (nihonto and nihontostudy) are being blocked!  My provider just telephoned to say that both of these groups are "blacklisted" on at least three nationwide IP lists (?..forget the correct terminology here...).  I have no idea why, but that is what I'm being told.  He is hopefully "fixing" the problem by placing both groups on a "white list" which overrides the "black list."  Let's hope it works.  I'll know only when my mail once again begins to arrive.  <br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, if anyone wishes to contact me via a list, try Chris Bowen's list.  That is coming through okay.  Again, just passing this on for what it's worth.<br/>
