<br/>
Gorby und I have been digging through all the tsuba books we <br/>
have......... nothing  like this turns up in any book.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So.....  this could be a tourist Yokohama special not worthy of <br/>
illustration ? something so rare that few collections has an example ?<br/>
<br/>
By the way, it's not gold paint.........it's very thin gold foil <br/>
cover.<br/>
<br/>
Cary ? Jim ?  Herr professor Robson ?   any thoughts ??<br/>
anyone ?  please??<br/>

You're the gorby dude! This is a Shachi, an imaginary sea creature that was<br/>
small but fierce, in the Momoyama period images of it were placed on the<br/>
rooftops of castles to ward off fire. The Golden Shachi of Nagoya being of<br/>
greatest fame, they were oft copied (and stolen).A very cool tsuba IMHO,<br/>

<br/>
P.S. though reputed to eat whales and cut ships in half with their fins<br/>
these are NOT killer whales, though oddly, Shachi is translated as "Orca"...<br/>

Tremendous tsuba, no doubt about it. I thought it might be a carp<br/>
turning ito a dragon after jumping through the 'dragon gate'. A theme<br/>
often seen on Chinese and Japanese porcleain. Could that be another<br/>
explanation or am I just full of it ?<br/>

Tom is of course right about the motif being a shachihoko.  The construction of a copper core sandwiched between thin gold layers and finished with a fukurin is not that unusual.  It's seen in Momoyama period Ko-Kinko work for example, often with wave and floating mon motifs.  Most of these are not as high relief as yours and are usually not so crisply carved.  The shape of the hitsu-ana and the general workmanship of this one seem more in line with the Edo period.  Of course the hitsu-ana could have been enlarged later and relined with gold.<br/>
<br/>
The Genroku period was the next point in time when this kind of display was in style.  My guess is that your guard is from that time  It doesn't look very late to me.  It could possibly be earlier than Genroku.  Hard to say more without seeing it.  <br/>

That was my initial thought, but checking my references it was clear <br/>
this was a Shachi and not a carp crossing the Toryu-mon.<br/>
<br/>
-t<br/>
<br/>
BTW at one time there was a guy in the US Navy named Larry. Don't know <br/>
his last name it is lost to time. He was such a screw up everything he <br/>
touched went to Shizuoka if you get my drift. His name became <br/>
synonymous with F-ups. When I worked at Hunters Point Naval Shipyard, <br/>
"He pulled a Larry" or "Watch out you don't Larry that up" were common <br/>
expressions. You may be THE Gorby, but it doesn't mean that every now <br/>
and again Milt or anyone one of us might be a Gorby, Gorby!</div>
