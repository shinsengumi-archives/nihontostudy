<div id="ygrps-yiv-2036689521">Good day to all and a Happy Thanksgiving to whom it will apply!  Does <br/>
anyone know of the process by which kogai were reformed to kozuka?  I <br/>
have recently received a kozuka naoshi and I notice it has the same <br/>
triangular taper of standard kozuka and as I believe kogai are flat I <br/>
am wondering how it was re-constructed?  Thanks much!<br/>

<br/>
The plate with the design and nanako is cut out of the kogai and that <br/>
plate is fitted into the top plate of a kozuka. Usually you can see a <br/>
change in the nanako or even a line where the kogai plate has been <br/>
inserted into a kozuka plate.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-592887563">Thank you very much Gordon.  I can see a very fine line at the blade <br/>
insertion end which resembles what you describe.  It makes sense.  <br/>
Thanks again and take care.<br/>
