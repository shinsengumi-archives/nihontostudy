<div id="ygrps-yiv-459907430">Hi everyone,<br/>
Just got in a lot of new nice items. Posted some of them on the site at Ricecracker.com <br/>
(http://www.ricecracker.com)<br/>
<br/>
Here are some of the items:<br/>
M-5 (#813) Spectacular Tokubetsu Hozon Kaga Goto Menuki<br/>
M-9 (#814) 5th Mainline Goto Master Tokujo menuki<br/>
T-9 (#810) Excellent tsuba by the Famous Nishigaki School<br/>
T-11(#811) Very Nice Choshu Amaryu Tsuba<br/>
<br/>
Also have a couple of good Dai-Sho.<br/>
I will be putting up a Rare REAL Dai Sho By Yasukuni Yasutake over the next couple of days.<br/>
<br/>
We have many swords and kodogu that never make it to the site, so if you don't see what you are looking for it is a good idea to email us and ask.<br/>
<br/>
Also for those of you going to the San Francisco Sword Show be sure to come by our tables and ask for John to get that special show deal!<br/>
See you all at the show,<br/>
