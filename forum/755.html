<h3>tsuba opinion, please</h3>
by <i>bungotakadasword</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-501469479">gang,<br/>
I recently bought a rusty tsuba.............<br/>
<br/>
dimension....3 inches x 3 1/4 inches<br/>
thickness..... a touch more than 3 mm, but less than 4mm<br/>
there is a " groove around the rim with traces of lacquer so i <br/>
assumed a metal band was there but now missing.<br/>
<br/>
looking at the dragon, at 2 O'clock, I think the forearm is missing, <br/>
so the construction of the brass dragon could be " layered " ?<br/>
At 11 O'clock, only 2 claws are visible so something is missing there <br/>
too.<br/>
<br/>
questions..............<br/>
1. in rust removal using ivory, should i work around the traces of <br/>
lacquer leaving those intact ?<br/>
2.  any opinion as to school/time period ?<br/>
I am guessing....<br/>
 a.  Heianjo  ( on a good day )?<br/>
b.  Jingo works ( on a very very good day )?<br/>
c. The all purpose Shoami ( no weather report here ) ??<br/>
d.  18th century or earlier ?<br/>
<br/>
Thank you all in advance...........<br/>

the pics are in Milt's folder or klick on............<br/>

I suspect that the missing body parts are meant to suggest that those parts are obscured as if behind clouds.<br/>
<br/>
It may be the lighting, but the iron surface has the gray, shiny look of fire scale in places.  Even with that uncertainty, the plate and the inlay don't look typical of Heianjo.  The Jingo did make guards in that rounded square shape and did use a deeply hammered modulation of the plate.  The condition may be confusing, but the apparent quality of the plate, the handling of the texture and the shape and placement of the ana don't come up to Jingo quality standards here.  They did do some brass suemon zogan dragons, but the style is different from this one.  The Higo Kinko Taikan has a lot of doubtful examples included, but if you can get a look at a copy, the Jingo section is worth comparing against your guard.<br/>
<br/>
My guess is that it is some later worker trying to make something like a Jingo guard.  The handling of the plate is consistent with Shoami work.  The inlay is not exactly typical Shoami, but it's something that I'd imagine any number of groups could have done.<br/>
<br/>
I think it's generally better to leave old lacquer alone, but with very rusted tsuba sometimes there is no way to keep it intact.  If it is fire scale, you won't be able to bone it off.<br/>
<br/>
Any other ideas?<br/>

Thanks, Jim,<br/>
It's the lighting, I used flash...........<br/>
<br/>
I have since cleaned up most of the rust and taken more pics under natural <br/>
lighting condition which is a lot closer to the " true " color. I have noticed <br/>
the area where I most aggressively scrapped off the rust, the resulting surface <br/>
color is black  while the other area is brown.<br/>
I also took a close up of the dragon to show the actual color of the brass <br/>
and the area where I believe body parts are missing.<br/>
I wiill post the pics in the folder later............<br/>

It might be Mito work, but it could have been made elsewhere as well.  The upside down Fuji-san on the back is probably a reflection in a lake.  There are several lakes that are famous scenic spots for viewing Mt. Fuji this way.  A Google image search on "fuji kawaguchi ko" yields:<br/>

<br/>
This is a general question to those out there planning on attending <br/>
this year's Daitoken Ichi in Tokyo during the last weekend in October, <br/>
the 29th, 30th and 31st. The NTHK, the real one, usually has it's <br/>
special sword appreciation gather at the same time; however, this year <br/>
we wanted to do something with the Sano Museum in Mishima. <br/>
Unfortunately, Watanabe sensei is not available during the weekend, but <br/>
is available on November 3rd, which is a national holiday in Japan. <br/>
Would delaying our special meeting until three days after the Daitoken <br/>
Ichi be a bad idea even given that we will have masterpiece works from <br/>
the Sano Museum available for hands-on study with lecturing from <br/>
Watanabe sensei? In other words, would those of you planning on <br/>
attending be willing to hang around for four more days or so?<br/>
