<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1736939418">I just got a japanese sword... me friend bought a old house & found it<br/>
in the basement with some other old japanese things... i took the<br/>
bamboo pins our & removed the handle & there is a line of japanese<br/>
wrighting on both sides of the tang... the hand guard is iron shaped<br/>
like a 4 petaled flower sort of... no other metal on the scabbard or<br/>
handle other than the guard & a peice what looks like gold that goes<br/>
over the blade just in front of the guard... the blade has some rust on<br/>
it but not pitted anywhere... how do i clean off the rust and what<br/>
parts of the sword can i clean without ruining its value if it has<br/>
any ? havent done anything to it as far as trying to clean anything...<br/>
only took off the handle to look...</div>
