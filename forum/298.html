<div id="ygrps-yiv-1161308527">Greetings all, a friend ( yes it was Milt ) purchased this and we were<br/>
discussing the mei. Sorry, this is the best pic. It was sold as<br/>
aKunisuke but I think it reads Kanetsugu. Also the first two Kanji have<br/>
us stuck. WIth out looking at my book's, ( I love a challenge ) I was<br/>
thinking Yoshida Kanetsugu. Was I even close ???<br/>

fifth kanji well enough to make a call...<br/>
