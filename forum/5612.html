<h3>Back-to-School Book Sale! 40% off!</h3>
by <i>musashibobenkei</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-760039379">Since we all need to go "Back to School" from time to time, and my kids are<br/>
going back to school, I'm starting a 40% off sale on all titles on my<br/>
website.<br/>
<br/>
I'll also be announcing special deals on specific books that will be even<br/>
better deals.<br/>
<br/>
Be sure to check out some of the other categories on the website for books<br/>
of interest, including Japanese History, Literature, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Order through the website and I'll get back to you with the net amount<br/>
including shipping charges (at cost) before your credit card is charged or<br/>
PayPal payment initiated.<br/>
<br/>
I do still continue to find books that have not been uploaded, so feel free<br/>
to ask if you don't see a book you have been looking for, or especially if<br/>
you are looking for recommendations related to a specific subject.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for looking!<br/>
<br/>
