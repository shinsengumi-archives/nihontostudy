<h3>Identifying this tsuba?</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1145114324">Lists-<br/>
<br/>
After David's tsuba post and the good response, I<br/>
wanted to ask for help in identifying this tsuba:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://tinyurl.com/nxjj3">http://tinyurl.com/nxjj3</a><br/>
<br/>
Image of the mimi:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://tinyurl.com/n47uw">http://tinyurl.com/n47uw</a><br/>
<br/>
Alternatively, the images can be seen in my folder at<br/>
the Nihonto or Nihontostudy group sites.<br/>
<br/>
Details:   Some running lines 'bone' lines in the mimi<br/>
and hints of fold seams. The tsuba is nice iron, with<br/>
a good bit more magnetite to its patina than evident<br/>
in the photo (and evident to me the first time I<br/>
picked it up in its previous rusty condition).<br/>
<br/>
Note: The tsuba is concave on one side, much less so<br/>
on the other side. So it is 1 to 2 mm thinner at the<br/>
seppa dai than along the mimi.<br/>
<br/>
Opinions as to school?<br/>
<br/>
Thank you,<br/>
<br/>

There are some Owari characteristics, but guards like this almost always get attributed to Shoami.  The small size, the rounding of the rim, texture of the iron and the style of tekkotsu are all Shoami traits.  It looks like a nice guard.  It's a common overall design, but I don't think I've seen it with gourds at the top and bottom like that.  I wonder if the other figures are cloves.<br/>

I originally thought Kyo shoami. I bought it as such.<br/>
Size is 70mm x 75mm x 5mm thick. About 3.5 thick at<br/>
seppa dai.<br/>
<br/>
Sure feels Higo in the hand and working with the iron.<br/>
Darker than evident in this Florida sun drenched<br/>
photo. Nagged me that it had something relaxed about<br/>
it like an Umetada piece, but didn't think it typical<br/>
of them.<br/>
<br/>
As I said, my original thoughts were kyo-shoami. I<br/>
bought this one off photos, and it proved to be more<br/>
than I anticipated. So much going on in the mimi.<br/>
<br/>
Too many confusing characteristics. From the photos I<br/>
totally understand a 'shoami' call. In hand, I don't<br/>
know. Doesn't feel shoami. Thought someone might name<br/>
a semi-obscure sidechool that might be a better fit.<br/>

I don't think that there's a better label out there, but hopefully someone will weigh in with one.  Be aware that there are guards that show admixtures of style, for example Kyo-Owari blend.  Those 50/50 mixes can be frustrating, but I don't know that we'll ever unravel them short of some extensive metallurgical survey.<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I don't see Higo or Umetada in it.  Usually Kyo-Shoami is used to describe guards done in marubori and/or nunome zogan.  A straight iron sukashi guard would normally be described as Shoami, or if pre-Edo period as Ko-Shoami.  Don't be discouraged by the Shoami tag.  Good Shoami guards will have nice activity in the rim.  <br/>
<br/>
The guard is what it is independent of the label.<br/>
