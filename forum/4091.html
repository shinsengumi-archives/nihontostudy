<h3>Tokugawa tsuba</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1238200300">Greetings all,<br/>
<br/>
In my reading, I recall seeing somewhere that, early in the Tokugawa Period, the <br/>
government issued various "edicts"/measures aimed at standardizing aspects of the <br/>
wearing of swords (who may wear them, blade lengths, saya colors, etc...).  I believe I also <br/>
remember reading that this extended all the way to the standardization of the hitsuana of <br/>
tsuba, among other things...  I'm wondering whether any of you far more knowledgeable <br/>
than me might confirm this, and would also be able to supply an approximate date when <br/>
such edicts were handed down.  <br/>
<br/>
What I'm curious about is this:  how possible might it be to (in part) determine whether or <br/>
not a particular tsuba was made in the early Tokugawa Period vs. the late Momoyama <br/>
based (in part) on the passing of this law?  I'm thinking here that if a certain tsuba <br/>
possesses idiosyncratic hitsuana (or other non-standard features), would this allow a more <br/>
confident dating to an earlier time (again, as part of the assessment process)?  Or are <br/>
there many variables (including lax enforcement of such "laws") which would render this <br/>
line of thought essentially useless?  I think about such departures as Shimizu Jingo <br/>
(shodai) and think that maybe this isn't a very good barometer...!  Anyway, just thinking <br/>
out loud here.  Your thoughts appreciated...<br/>
