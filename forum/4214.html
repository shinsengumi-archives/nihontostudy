<h3>short report on the Chicago show just ended</h3>
by <i>bungotakadasword</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-256246998">just back from the Chicago show and here's the personal <br/>
prospective.........<br/>
no Japanese dealers present due to the big holiday in Japan at the <br/>
same time, so next year the show may switch to a different date.  <br/>
Just speculation , ok ?<br/>
<br/>
Personally I did a lot of buy/sell/trade............<br/>
as usual Walberg brought along his boxes of goodies and emptied my <br/>
wallet. Among the new toys I bought from the Big Guy is a signed Goto <br/>
school single fuchi with a peacock motif which matches exactly my <br/>
other mumei fuchi...so now I am quite positive the other unsigned <br/>
piece is of the Goto school.<br/>
<br/>
Did see a few " big money " changed hands so there's some " actions " <br/>
going on there .<br/>
<br/>
As usual Jim gave an excellent presentation/discussion  on what make <br/>
a good tsuba.  I,  being my usual self with the big mouth , actually <br/>
has the audacity to say a tsuba " turned me off "......with <br/>
strange/interesting result !!  Jim did mention there's no right or <br/>
wrong answer regarding the tsuba so i figure why not......<br/>
<br/>
Benson's tsuba price is very very reasonable at the show but too bad <br/>
I dropped all my $ at Hagrid's.<br/>
<br/>
The best part of the show is still touching bases with old friends, <br/>
telling the same ole stale jokes and seeing everyone is still alive <br/>
and kicking........<br/>
Perfect weather throughout and to cap the day, i get to spot the <br/>
resident red tail hawk's nest and see the magificient bird flying and <br/>
doing well.<br/>
For more detail and insightful report............ that you have to <br/>
wait till Barry gets home.<br/>
