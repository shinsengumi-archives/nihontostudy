<h3>Higo</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1367764021">Hey Curran -- my gut hunch is either Nakane Heihachiro or Edo Higo, <br/>
most prob Nakane.  The example on Andy Quirts site and this one have <br/>
the same indentations about the nakagoana (I am not certain if tagane <br/>
mei is appropriate here -- Jim would know on this -- I've seen this on <br/>
other Higo pieces also).  You know I've seen examples from some of the <br/>
other Higo schools with this 'look' so it's sort of a guess.  <br/>
<br/>
From what I've heard the Higo Taikan has a lot of questionable <br/>
attributions, but then it seems as time goes on that's what you here <br/>
about most of the older reference books.  I get the feeling there is a <br/>
move into orthodoxy going on in the field -- Sasano, Torigoye, and <br/>
other explorationists being questioned in absentia.  Hmmmm, always <br/>
interesting.  I have to wonder at times if not being able to read the <br/>
Japanese texts is a curse or a blessing in disguise as it forces us to <br/>
think for ourselves (heretics all) instead of towing the party line.<br/>
Well, I guess I've still got that 60's in me!  Later.</div>

<h3>Higo</h3>
by <i>klepet33319</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1777216786">Let's not rule out later Nishigaki either as it was influenced by the <br/>
Edo Higo group (Torigoye, Tsuba An Aesthetic Study).  I tend to have a <br/>
problem with metal quality as a parameter because as you progress into <br/>
the later Edo period factory plate was presumably used in greater <br/>
quantity.  The sharpness of the sukashi and ornateness of the inlay <br/>
influence my feeling toward Edo Higo.  <br/>
As far as fare market value, who knows?  If in doubt I'd take it to <br/>
Tampa and show it around.  It's only a few weeks off anyway (unreal, <br/>
huh) and it's far better than Ebay!  Later.</div>
