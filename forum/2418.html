<h3>Kanabo arrived</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-254706198">Hi everyone<br/>
I wrote a few weeks back that I had purchased this kanabo from ebay.<br/>

It arrived early this week and I ma very pleased with it- as far as <br/>
I can tell the age of the iron and wood is even and consistent with <br/>
being several centuries old.  My problem now is research.  Out of <br/>
all my books (which is a fair number) I have only one reference to <br/>
this kind of weapon- in Arms and Armor of the Samurai by Hopson and <br/>
Bottomley.  If anyone out there can assist me in finding further <br/>
references, pictures or other info I would sincerely appreciate it.<br/>
Thanks for your time.<br/>
