I've been out of town for a while.  The color of the base metal and the rubbed gold overlay look like what's found in the so-called Ezo fittings.  Most of these are menuki and saya kanemono, some of which are quite old.  I can't recall seeing an Ezo kozuka.  It'd be an interesting piece to see in person.  We had a nice pair of Ezo menuki at the London shinsa that were assigned to the early Muromachi period.<br/>
