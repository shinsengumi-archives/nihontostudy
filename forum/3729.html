<div id="ygrps-yiv-1453131249">Tom, excellent stuff. Thanks very much for that. I had another <br/>
translation as well form a friend in Japan. He wrote pretty much as you <br/>
did. ( see link )<br/>

I have Suishinshi Masahide no sono Ichimon and looked through again and <br/>
sure enough, there you are. There just seems to be a couple of lines <br/>
there about the tsuba, unless buried in the paragraphs that follow. They <br/>
are certainly excellent looking tsuba and I may have to try and track <br/>
one down when I get to Japan, just for a look at least.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers and thanks again.<br/>
