<h3>Yari type</h3>
by <i>sworddad</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-453829301">Hi All - <br/>
<br/>
Can anyone tell me the correct (accepted today) name for a yari I'm making a record sheet on today? To describe it, it is a stubby, short (4") head, 4-sided yari made with yokote. This one is quite nice and signed by Yokoyama Bizen Sukehira (shinshin-to). <br/>
<br/>
In Kajihara's glossery (p.250) illustrates what I would say is that shape/form, but a number of names are given for it: tanpo yari, te yari, ko-yari, kago yari, mijika-yari. <br/>
<br/>
The mijika-yari elaborates, saying "short, straight yari of 3 to 6 sun." This sounds like what my yari would be but then the other types are simply identified by a name (which I can not translate, other than the ko-yari). Any answer to this?<br/>
<br/>
Can anyone comment on Knutsen's latest publication on pole arms, if it is useful...cost and sources? I've yet to buy a copy and have already forgotten the name of this latest Knutsen publication. <br/>

If I could also add, a reference to Roald Knutsen other "new" book "<br/>
Rediscovering Budo from a Swordsmans Perspective"  - although less on<br/>
weaponry information as is his Japanese Spears & Polearms - ... it is a<br/>
wonderful read and a great reference book on the roots/history and tradition<br/>
of Bujutsu & Budo from a person with a wealth of hands-on experience in<br/>
Japan of the swordsmans & warrior culture.<br/>

Someone was asking about when the reprint of Knutsen's book on polearms<br/>
would be available.  I just got the below in an email from Paragon.  Amazon<br/>
s price is the same.<br/>
<br/>
Knutsen, Roald & Knutsen, Patricia: JAPANESE SPEARS: POLEARMS AND THEIR USE<br/>
IN OLD JAPAN  7 x 9.75", xxvi, 131 pp., 16 b/w plates, 64 pages of b/w<br/>
figures, glossary, bibliography, index, cloth, d.j., Kent, 2004.<br/>
This fully illustrated study of naginata and yari, the only reference of its<br/>
kind in English, records the many variations of spear design from the<br/>
ancient period when warrior chieftains settled in Japan from the Asian<br/>
mainland, down to the fall of the Tokugawa in 1868 that marked the close of<br/>
the feudal period. In addition, it offers the reader valuable insight into<br/>
the historical attitude of the Japanese warrior to warfare and examples of<br/>
how these often splendid weapons in the bujutsu - the arts of the<br/>
battlefield. Item # 30321 ISBN 1901903567 (Global Oriental) Price: $50.00 <br/>
