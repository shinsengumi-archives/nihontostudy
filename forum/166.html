<h3>kogai on katana</h3>
by <i>rkgatteleport</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-328015414">Hey guys,<br/>
<br/>
I was just curious - Anybody have any idea why momoyama era katana <br/>
sometimes got only a kogai?<br/>
<br/>
Was it merely a matter of cost (since all most people would see was the <br/>
kogai side, you'd be<br/>
"in fashion" with just a kogai), or was there some practical reason for <br/>
having just a kogai?<br/>
<br/>
thx,<br/>

It was the custom to have a kogai and matching menuki on a katana in the<br/>
16th century, the set was called a futokoromono, these were often turned<br/>
into a 3 piece set or mitokoromono with the later addition of a kozuka made<br/>
to order with the same motif . Kozuka were much less common until the later<br/>
16th century, the mitokoromono then were mainly mounted on wakizashi.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-267830179">Hi Tom and all,<br/>
<br/>
In the Sasano book I previously mentioned, he claims that kozuka as well as<br/>
kogai date back to the Heian period. He supports this with ubu-ana in early<br/>
tsuba. Of course, you have to accept that his dating of undated,<br/>
undocumented tsuba are as early as Heian and Kamakura periods. It has<br/>
recently become fashionable to make all of Sasano's dates much later<br/>
(younger?). I also have serious doubts about kogai being used for marking or<br/>
carrying heads. I don't think they would stand up to that kind of abuse.<br/>
Picking ears and combing hair, certainly. Nonetheless, there certainly are<br/>
tsuba, and tsuba that are clearly early -- Nambokucho to be conservative --<br/>
that have ubu kozuka ana as well as ubu kogai ana. <br/>
