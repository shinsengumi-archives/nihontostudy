<h3>tsuba questions</h3>

<br/>
I just bought a tsuba which is quite old and much worn down.  On the first<br/>
side, it has an oni sitting happily beneath a flowering tree by the light of<br/>
a full moon, while below him a snail crawls by. Moon, blossoms, and the<br/>
oni's horns are gold.  On the reverse, the oni is disappearing away from us,<br/>
as the snail crosses the bottom in his direction.<br/>
<br/>
Are tsubas this worn considered to be severely diminished in value?<br/>
<br/>
Is anyone acquainted with a Japanese oni-and-snail story?</div>

I think that the surface of the guard was made more or less as you see it.  I don't think that it is so old or worn down.  It is done in Nara style, but is probably later shiiremono given the quality of the plate and inlay.  I don't see oni horns on the front... they look more like the tops of pagoda done in Kaneie-style landscape.  The "blossoms" are probably just the usual depiction of pine needle whorls.  But, you have the plate in hand and photos are difficult to work with.<br/>

<br/>
While I agree with Jim it is done in Nara style I am not so sure it is a later copy.  It may be an original Nara piece done in a more subtle style or a later Nara school work.  <br/>
<br/>
From your pictures it is very difficult to tell the color or quality of the iron plate which is the determining factor in iron tsuba and its quality.<br/>
<br/>
The flower and other work seem to be of the Nara school work even if they are hard to see. I would think if someone would go to the trouble to make a copy of a Nara tsuba they would make it a little more flamboyant or copy one of the Nara masters.<br/>

Looking at the enlarged picture I think Jim may have been right in the first place.  <br/>
<br/>
The plate and iron do not look like Nara.  There seems to be a partially hammered and raised mimi on the bottom that disappears further up the plate.<br/>
<br/>
I think you could help it a lot by giving it a "once over" with some mild liquid soap and a soft toothbrush.<br/>

    and allow time for a largish file to load, you can see a less flattering, more detailed scan.  This image can be saved and looked at in larger size in Photoshop and similar programs.<br/>

      Hi David;<br/>
<br/>
      While I agree with Jim it is done in Nara style I am not so sure it is a later copy.  It may be an original Nara piece done in a more subtle style or a later Nara school work.  <br/>
<br/>
      From your pictures it is very difficult to tell the color or quality of the iron plate which is the determining factor in iron tsuba and its quality.<br/>
<br/>
      The flower and other work seem to be of the Nara school work even if they are hard to see. I would think if someone would go to the trouble to make a copy of a Nara tsuba they would make it a little more flamboyant or copy one of the Nara masters.<br/>

        Thank you for trying.  Clearly the photos were not very successful in conveying the piece to anyone.<br/>

          I think that the surface of the guard was made more or less as you see it.  I don't think that it is so old or worn down.  It is done in Nara style, but is probably later shiiremono given the quality of the plate and inlay.  I don't see oni horns on the front... they look more like the tops of pagoda done in Kaneie-style landscape.  The "blossoms" are probably just the usual depiction of pine needle whorls.  But, you have the plate in hand and photos are difficult to work with.<br/>

            I just bought a tsuba which is quite old and much worn down.  On the first<br/>
            side, it has an oni sitting happily beneath a flowering tree by the light of<br/>
            a full moon, while below him a snail crawls by. Moon, blossoms, and the<br/>
            oni's horns are gold.  On the reverse, the oni is disappearing away from us,<br/>
            as the snail crosses the bottom in his direction.<br/>
<br/>
            Are tsubas this worn considered to be severely diminished in value?<br/>
<br/>
            Is anyone acquainted with a Japanese oni-and-snail story?<br/>
