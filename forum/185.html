  For those who haven't seen the book, the best detail online from the Ban Dainagon I've found so far is here:<br/>

  Look at the fellow in the upper left hand corner.  He is carrying an uchigatana with a tsuba, however it's rather difficult to say whether it might be made of iron, yamagane or leather.<br/>

  Gordon - do you have any sort of image of the nagamaki tsuba?  Is it a plain iron plate without sukashi?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2044565712">It is a perfectly round disk with no sukashi. I will see about doing a scan<br/>
and trying a post. I'm at work now so I will have to try tomorrow. I will<br/>
also check the text to see if there is an attempt at giving it a date. Based<br/>
on the size and rusting, I would say late Kamakura to Nambokucho. Sasano did<br/>
not mention what blade, if any, it was on.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-92648742">Funny that you mentioned it, I was thinking about the same thing today.

These are rather undecorated mounts, so I'd guess that there was some perceived functional advantage rather than just a display of status and/or aesthetics at play.<br/>

I'd also guess that the nerikawa tsuba took more time and labor to make (curing, soaking, gluing, drying...fitting a fukurin...).

I'd guess that kawa would also be expensive in the sense that it'd need to be replaced more frequently than iron.  Getting a tsuba made of it wet would not be a good idea, for example.  It may be that the durability of iron is what made it more attractive for the lower status mounts.<br/>
