<h3>Kyo or Kyo</h3>
by <i>retalt</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-184595418">All, a recent acquisition is this sukashi tsuba with a Yukiwa no Kasa <br/>
theme ( circular snow flakes and a parasol ). There is also a single <br/>
Karegane ( wild geese ) in there as well.<br/>
<br/>
The tsuba has an NBTHK Tokubetsu Kicho kanteisho to Kyo Sukashi. But in <br/>
closer study, this guard looks very much like Kyo Shoami. The heavier <br/>
set and general theme and balance are leading me to that conclusion. The <br/>
tsuba has a rich brown patina and the scan does it little justice. I <br/>
would think this from the early to mid Edo period.<br/>
<br/>
It's dimensions are 80mm x 78mm x 5.5mm<br/>
<br/>
So my question is, was there cross over between Kyo sukashi and Kyo <br/>
shoami, I feel there is generally enough to tell the two schools apart <br/>
but there is always something new to surprise us I guess. I guess I am <br/>
asking, does this look typical of Kyo Sukashi ?<br/>
