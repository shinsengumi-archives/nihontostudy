<div id="ygrps-yiv-1499842998">Hi All, I need those that are well versed in Goto work to help me out <br/>
here. This F&K I was told is signed by Goto Shunjo (Mitsunaga) of the <br/>
I think Hachirebei line. I have the Gotoke Junanadai No Tousougu but <br/>
it is mainline only.   link:  www.johnstuart.biz/new_page_9.htm    I <br/>
would really like to know if this is gimei. Thanks, John</div>

Shunjo/Mitsunaga was the nidai of the Hachirobei line and that is what the inscription reads, but it is hopelessly fake.   Kyo Goto no Kenkyu (1988) by Kasahara Koju and Akimoto Shigeo is the present definitive reference on waki Goto.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-829612874">The workmanship is lower middle level, but not terrible.  My guess is that the signature was not done by the maker.  The usual forged signature approximates the genuine article.  The signature here is totally off in the arrangement of the characters, the placement of the strokes and the broad, chippy style of carving.  The maker of this piece could have carved a better gimei.<br/>
