<br/>
I never met the man but I was always told by everyone what a scholar he<br/>
was. I encountered his writing everywhere. What a loss :-(.<br/>

Collections".  It seems like he was highly regarded by the nihonto community <br/>
in Japan.  Thanks for the update.<br/>

<h3>Re: [nihontostudy] Mr Han Bing Siong</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-907420899">Ah, I am in a deep well of sadness.  In my early days of collecting and<br/>
intermittently over many years Mr Han and I enjoyed a lively correspondence.  He<br/>
was unfailingly helpful, even to an excess of research on my behalf.  Clearly,<br/>
he enjoyed the task because it increased his own knowledge and awareness of<br/>
Nihont么.  One only has to read his "Study at the Sword Museum" series of<br/>
articles in the English NBTHK journals to see the depth of his knowledge and<br/>
committment to Nihont么 studies and preservation.  His superior knowledge was<br/>
invaluable to me as I set about trying to find good swords as a beginner.<br/>
Thanks to his influence and stirling scholarly example, and that of many others<br/>
in our little community, I have come to regard it as a sacred duty to pass on<br/>
such freely given knowledge as I've managed to gain over the years.<br/>
<br/>
Over the years Mr Han was a prolific author, although I haven't seen an article<br/>
by him for quite some years now.  His writings were thorough pieces of research<br/>
eruditely expressed and meticulously footnoted.<br/>
<br/>
Mr Han was a 9th (?) generation Chinese teaching in Indonesia before he left to<br/>
live in The Netherlands.  He was a lawyer, I believe.  I still have a photo of a<br/>
kenukigata tachi with a gendait么 he acquired from one of his students, the son<br/>
of one of President Soekarno's close aides.  Mr Han's wife died some two or so<br/>
years ago and I remember her passing being mentioned here.  He and his wife had<br/>
no children.<br/>
<br/>
I haven't corresponded with Mr Han for some years now, but it is time to go and<br/>
have a read through our correspondence and shed a tear for this great man of<br/>
Nihont么, in whose shade those such as I still struggle to learn and understand.<br/>
<br/>
Best regards to all,<br/>
<br/>
