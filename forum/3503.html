<h3>Folder in Files Section</h3>
by <i>pac0datac0</i>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1984762597">I created a folder in the files section called "WW2 Katana Pics". Sorry <br/>
for the quality, they were taken with a camera phone. I have a close up <br/>
of the tsuba and other parts of it. The close up of the blade, showing <br/>
the hada, is pretty fuzzy. In my opinion, the hada and hamon on the <br/>
blade are dead giveaways, to me, that the sword is fake. But let me <br/>
know what you guys think.</div>
