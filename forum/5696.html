I had a chance to look at a very interesting tsuba recently.  It's a typical bird in the plum tree Higo guard, but what's interesting is that it wasn't completed.  The design is scribed into the plate and all of the roughing out was done with a chisel.  Even the outline of the rim is chiseled in with multiple cuts from both sides. It looks like a slight gouge was used while cutting the rim and most of the sukashi was cut with a straight chisel.<br/>
<br/>
A couple of sections of sukashi have some file work done, but the rest is still rough.  It looks like one of the thin branches was chiseled down too thin to be finished properly and the piece was abandoned.  The color of the guard isn't bad (even though I doubt any patina was applied) and the build up on the interior sukashi walls looks about like you'd expect for an Edo piece.<br/>

Mr. nicemaletrust posts hundreds of messages, but they get stopped before<br/>
they hit the list, he gets deleted and he rejoins under a new but similar<br/>
user name. I've come to admire "his" persistence, although he's probably a<br/>
boiler room somewhere rather than an individual.<br/>
<br/>
I'm afraid that Gordon may be waving his cane and yelling at the kids to<br/>
stay off his lawn before long...<br/>
<br/>
I had a chance to look at a very interesting tsuba recently. It's a typical<br/>
bird in the plum tree Higo guard, but what's interesting is that it wasn't<br/>
completed. The design is scribed into the plate and all of the roughing out<br/>
was done with a chisel. Even the outline of the rim is chiseled in with<br/>
multiple cuts from both sides. It looks like a slight gouge was used while<br/>
cutting the rim and most of the sukashi was cut with a straight chisel.<br/>
<br/>
A couple of sections of sukashi have some file work done, but the rest is<br/>
still rough. It looks like one of the thin branches was chiseled down too<br/>
thin to be finished properly and the piece was abandoned. The color of the<br/>
guard isn't bad (even though I doubt any patina was applied) and the build<br/>
up on the interior sukashi walls looks about like you'd expect for an Edo<br/>
piece.<br/>
<br/>
I recently spent two weeks shooting in Baja Sur, Mexico. A great place,<br/>
other than the developed Cabo area on the southern tip. <br/>

It's really very nice to hear from you.  I'm sure we have all missed your worthy contributions to "your" list.  I'm a bit concerned to read of your shooting - did you mean with a camera??!!!  With your bird-loving pursuits I wonderd if your shooting was blasting feathers off a delicious table bird...  Do please tell...<br/>

Great pictures as always but I was getting worked up about seeing a pic of<br/>
the unfinished Higo tsuba.<br/>
