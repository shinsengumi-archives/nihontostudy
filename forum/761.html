The first has some introductory material for the auction series, the preface and introduction to Tsuba Geijutsu-ko and a glossary.  There are 239 tsuba lots with a mix similar to what is in the other catalogs.  There are 40 lots of kodogu and some books, armor, etc.  There are about 68 lots of swords, including the Kokuho Iesuke, a Juyo Hasebe katana, a blade with Juyo tachi koshirae formerly owned by the Duke of Windsor, a daisho with gold mounted koshirae and another fancy daisho formerly owned by Admiral Nomura.  There's even a tanto by Francis Boyd.<br/>
<br/>
Number 5 has more of Tsuba Geijutsu-ko including Haruta, Suruga, Kamakura bori and the various brass inlay types.  There are 248 lots of tsuba, again the usual mix.  Also 150 or so kodogu lots plus some books, armor and miscellaneous stuff.  There are inro, netsuke, ogime,etc., and 57 lots of prints.  A little bit of everything.  I vaguely recall something about many of the copies of number 5 being damaged in storage, but it may just be that fewer were printed.     <br/>
<br/>
Alan Harvie has been selling new copies of the catalogs for years for a very low price, but he has run out of numbers 1, 5 and 10.<br/>

	Here's what Alan had to say, confirming what Jim has already told us...<br/>
-t<br/>
<br/>
  Now, as to Haynes No. 5.  The reason for its rarity is simple.  All <br/>
the spare copies were stored in a leaking compartment and most of the <br/>
remainders were destroyed.  There just are not that many copies <br/>
around.  Nos. 1 and 10 are all gone from my stock but they were <br/>
popular and are being hoarded someplace.  The true scarce one is No. <br/>
5.  I had fifty copies reprinted and they are all gone as well.  You <br/>
can recognize them because they have a soft paper cover instead of <br/>
the coated stock.<br/>
