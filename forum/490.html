I know it is not japanese sword related, but still thought some of you<br/>
might find this interesting. I have been interested in Chinese art for<br/>
over 10 years and have never seen one of these before !<br/>
 <br/>
Jade tsuba ?? Hmmmmm <br/>

In any case if it does not belong here, please delete the post.<br/>

I have seen a few jade sword guards in circulation, but I thought that their age was doubtful and their quality not so good even if as old as claimed.  I don't know much about jade, but your example looks much better than those.  The Metropolitan Museum of art in NY has a somewhat similar Chinese sword on display with a polished, undecorated (but very colorful) agate guard.  Some of the early Chinese swords found in Japan have similarly shaped metal guards, although without carved decoration.  <br/>
<br/>
I have one of these metal guards that a friend gave me years ago.  Pictures here:<br/>
