<h3>Shakudo Short Sword Hilts?</h3>

'The Dutch also traded with Japan and as a result a variety of wares<br/>

with the ivory hilts from Ceylon, contemporary Dutch hilts were the<br/>
prototypes for these exotic pieces. The craftsmen who made them were<br/>

I'm not positive, but I believe there was a book out a couple years back on<br/>
just this sort of thing. Don't recall the title, but I later sold my copy to<br/>
Pete Bleed so maybe Peter can enlighten us with more on this subject.<br/>

 I suppose that if you had an otherwise matching pair and the difference in condition looked like it was something that could result from wear or storage, they could pass.<br/>

Try to find a copy of the book "Sawasa, Japanese export art in black and<br/>

I have seen some of these pieces in person and the work is quite different<br/>
from Mino, although I see what you're thinking.  I'm not aware of anything<br/>
documenting who the specific makers were.  They weren't necessarily nihonto<br/>
fittings makers.  All sorts of decorative items were made in this style,<br/>
boxes, bowls, buttons, buckles, tea services, pipes, etc.  You should be<br/>
able to see some examples at the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam.  The Metropolitan<br/>
Museum here in NYC has a few examples on display.<br/>

<h3>Re: [nihontostudy] Shakudo Short Sword Hilts?</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-494094924">Dear Matt and Ron,<br/>
      I am very tardy in picking up this thread, but I am glad that someone<br/>
has surfaced this topic once again. It comes up every so often, but there<br/>
does not seem to be enough material - either documentary or material - to<br/>
put it to rest.<br/>
      The book that Ron mentioned is called simply "Sawasa" ISBN 90 400<br/>
9279 6. It was published by the Rijkmuseum in Amsterdam. In addition to a<br/>
bunch of other stuff, it shows about a half dozen Japanese mounted western<br/>
swords. These are either smallswords or hangers and they are NEAT! I would<br/>
love to have one. Indeed, I have kept my eye open for one of these for<br/>
several years, but have not be able to snag one.  I attended a sale at<br/>
Christies in London some years back and watched a beauty sell so I know<br/>
that they are out there ...  and that i can't afford them. Most studies of<br/>
European small swords include mention of these swords, but I have never<br/>
seen them treated in Japanese literature, As you point out, Matt, they are<br/>
clearly made with Japanese style, iconography, and techniques. I agree that<br/>
they seem "Mino" but that scould be simply because of the fine shakudo<br/>
work.<br/>
I urge you to keep you eye open for these in the Dutch market. Often they<br/>
are called either "Tonkinese" or "Chinese" but I think there can be no<br/>
question that they were made in Japan. Obviously, if you find any of these<br/>
that you do NOT wish to own, I hope you will contact me first!<br/>
      I love finding evidence that Japanese swords havelong been part of<br/>
the larger world and this seems to be one of those times. These swords show<br/>
that the world of the17th and 18th century knew that the Japanese were<br/>
making some beautiful swords.<br/>
