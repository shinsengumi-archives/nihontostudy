<h3>Mito vs Mito shoami</h3>
by <i>kdw21620</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-106387559">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
Hope everyone's holiday weekend is going well.  I have<br/>
a few tsuba I thought were mito shoami, someone told<br/>
me more likely just mito.  Can anyone give me some<br/>
clues to differences between the two?  I thought that<br/>
the 2 were the same.  Thanks.<br/>

I'm not an expert, but here's my take on it.<br/>
No they are not the same school. Mito is<br/>
not the same as Mito Shoami although they<br/>
both worked in the same area and undoubtedly<br/>
there is some contact. Styles are somewhat similar,<br/>
but IMHO, Mito Shoami does the better work.<br/>
There is some fine Mito work also. Mito tends<br/>
to be more copying of Nara school, using a lot<br/>
of shiriimono plates and styles. I hope Jim<br/>

<br/>
The Mito were the first to mass produce tsuba.  The made a number of standard shaped and sized iron plates of relatively poor quality for their tsuba and had a book of designs that a customer could choose from and have it mounted on the pre-made plate.  That is why you see so many Mito tsuba with  identical designs on them.<br/>

I think you are mistaken in your appraisal of Mito work, the Mito Shoami<br/>
never achieved much prominence but the Mito Kinko are among the best artists<br/>
who ever made fittings, particularly in the late Edo/Meiji periods with<br/>
artists like Hagiya Katsuhei and Unno Shomin. They were also very able<br/>
copyists, I remember Mr Ono some years ago showed me a well known Somin<br/>
kozuka of a horse (seen from the rear) in takazogan, I asked him how to tell<br/>
the real thing from a Mito copy, he said the only difference was that in the<br/>
copy the horse stood more proud, or was it the other way around?<br/>

Alan is definitely correct.  While not always to my personal taste, there were a number of Mito lines producing very high quality fittings.  Several of these Mito lineage founders were students of leading kinko artists.  No doubt the Mito Tokugawa branch family (with 350,000 koku revenue) and their retainers were responsible for supporting these many skilled workers. <br/>
<br/>
The standardized plates, designs taken from copy books, large scale production and relatively poor quality are characteristics of the Mito Shoami.  Aizu Shoami workers did a lot of the same.<br/>
<br/>
There are some rather poor quality, unsigned Mito tsuba as well.  It's probably possible to find a group of better than average Mito Shoami work that exceeds the quality of the bottom of Mito production.  These lesser pieces are probably the source of the confusion between Mito and Mito Shoami.  I have seen some fairly insipid mumei tsuba with kanteisho to Mito.<br/>
<br/>
It's true that better Mito workers did copy Nara, Hamano and others, but their copy work is nothing like the Mito Shoami stuff after the Nara style.  If anything the workmanship of the Mito copies is a bit over the top compared with the originals.  It's also usually signed by the maker.<br/>
<br/>
There was a book on published 5-10 years ago on Mito swords and tosogu.  Mine is out on loan and I don't remember the title or author's name.  Does anyone have one handy?  In any event, that's a good book to look through to get a feel for the better Mito work.<br/>
