I think that the one from the Compton koshirae was Ko-Kinko or maybe early Edo period.  It was gold "plate" as you say.<br/>
<br/>
Solid gold tsuba are pretty rare today.  The same owner has another one, also Umetada and both from around the Momoyama period.  I doubt that they were ever common, but probably most examples were melted down once they were no longer in use.  The Umetada ones are finished with very controlled file marks like the ones seen on their habaki of the period.<br/>

  cool, thanks Jim. How many tsuba would have been solid gold ?. I am not going to remember the smith but there is a lovely gold foiled/sheet ? plated tsuba ( I think ) in Comptons 100 famous swords. Part of a complete set of koshirae I believe. It features paulownia flowers over waves from memory.<br/>

There was one other one out on display at Choshu-ya two weekends ago, also<br/>
Umetada and also with file marks and ko-sukashi. That now makes three that I<br/>
have seen. There is also the dai-sho pair on Hideyoshi's dai-sho that are<br/>
go-san kiri-mono sukashi pieces. As Jim notes, the majority were melted<br/>
down, particularly when money got tight.<br/>
