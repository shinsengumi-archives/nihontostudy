I found this musuem site that has a lot of tsuba<br/>

I am hardly an expert but like you I am unawrae of Akasaka tsuba <br/>
having gilt decoration.  That said, I am not sure I would put a lot <br/>
of stock in this museum's kantei.  The one link you posted shows a <br/>
dragon shaped tsuba that they describe as being Umetada- sure looks <br/>
Kinai to me.  IOW don't let their Akasaka attribution upset your <br/>

Even though this is more a private to you I put it to the list for information.  A friend of mine has a daisho tsuba that is convex and entirely covered with full silver nunome.  There are also gold covered (uttori or nunome I'm not sure) symbols of good luck.
