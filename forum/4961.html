<h3>Yamon Naokatsu</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-613484102">Hi all - <br/>
<br/>
Does anyone know of any connection that Yamon Naokatsu (2nd generation) had with the Tokugawa? Reason I ask, I have a short katana by Shoji Yamon Naokatsu (dated Meiji 4 - 1871) which has a silver habaki with the Tokugawa aoi crest on it in sukashi (pierced). I believe this habaki was original to the sword (not a collector's replacement) but so far I've yet to find some connection between the smith and the Tokugawa. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-422125524">Thanks everyone, for your imput about this mon habaki on my Yamon Naokatsu katana. Soon after I sent out this question it dawned on me that by Meiji 4 the Tokugawa were no longer in power and therefore, a meaningful connection between this sword and the Tokugawa would be unlikely. But I'm glad I asked since this did bring about some on-line discussion. <br/>
<br/>
Interestingly, this sword which was owned for years by a good friend and eventually came to me last year, looks and feels much like a gendaito which I guess, it really is when you think about it. It is a very stoutly build and very masculine blade although made relatively short in length (63.7 cm). My other nidai Naokatsu which is dated 1865 is more a Nambokucho copy, measuring 77.9 cm with O-gissaki. I find it interesting to see the comparison in so few years but at a time of great "change" in Japan. It does surprise me that Naokatsu still had a patron at this time of change in power. <br/>

<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
It still could have a Tokugawa/Matsudaira connection, they just werent<br/>
samurai anymore, but that should not stop someone from putting their mon on<br/>
their swords habaki. Also, your point about gendai is very important as<br/>
that is just what it is. Any blade made after the haitonorei or banning the<br/>
wearing of swords is a gendai. A gendai and a gunto are not the same thing.<br/>
