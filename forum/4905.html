Nihonto starts on page seven.  There are some very nice kodogu listed <br/>
and I have to wonder if someone is disbursing their collection or if <br/>
it's just the usual happenstance?  Some nice iron from the Harvie <br/>
collection and two kozuka which I believe were on Colin Griffith's <br/>
site, one juyo Goto.  <br/>
I'll buy a lottery ticket tonight just in case. LOL</div>

A Lacquer Box of Arrows <br/>
Edo period (19th century) <br/>
The rectangular storage box lacquered black with paulownia crests in gold hiramaki-e, the edges fundame, the box designed on the interior with removable cross pieces cut with notches to hold arrows in place over five layers<br/>
<br/>
I have seen this illustrated in a book many, many years ago, so Pete may be right that a collection is being disbursed.  The book is buried somewhere amongst my 40-odd years accumulation as it was a "picture" book rather than a "serious" book to be looked after, but I'll never forget that box of arrows.  Mmmmmm.  If I find the book I'll send along the reference.<br/>
<br/>

PS - I'm away for the next week and will be "out of the office"...<br/>
