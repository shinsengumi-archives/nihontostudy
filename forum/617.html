<h3>polarizing subject - part deux</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1463150620">Hey guys,<br/>
<br/>
the polarizing material arrived in the mail earlier in the week and I <br/>
had a chance to try<br/>
polarizing the light source this morning.<br/>
<br/>
Looking at the screen I found that the glare and direct reflections <br/>
pretty much went<br/>
away(!) but, surprise! it completely fooled the light metering system of <br/>
the G2<br/>
(I haven't bothered to post a picture of the result - its pretty black).<br/>
<br/>
So I went to  manual and found I gotta get a bigger light (I went to a <br/>
100 watt halogen bulb<br/>
for the following pictures - I didn't use the second light because I was <br/>
a bit short<br/>
on time this morning).  I re - did the color balance for the final photo <br/>
(which I shot first),<br/>
 but this next photo (the tsuba with only the circular polarizer on) <br/>
isn't quite right (it was<br/>
shot last and I didn't redo the white balance after removing the <br/>
polarizing sheet for the<br/>
light source).  You'll note the pics aren't up to my usual standard of <br/>
sharpness either - I<br/>
think this is due to me opening up the f-stop (which reduces the depth of<br/>
field) and perhaps this camera suffers from the same autofocus errors <br/>
that some<br/>
of the other canon cameras (notably the 10D) have...<br/>
<br/>
That being said, this is a photo of the tsuba with only the circular <br/>
polarizer on - note<br/>
all the direct reflections:<br/>

<br/>
this final photo is with the polarizing sheet in place:<br/>

<br/>
the first thing to note is that most of those annoying reflections are <br/>
mostly gone (!)<br/>
the second thing to notice is the couple of purplish distortions I think <br/>
these can be minimized<br/>
or eliminated by moving the light further away and/or to a different <br/>
location (just get it further out<br/>
of the family of angles for the tsuba), or maybe a small gobo or <br/>
something.  I think the white<br/>
flash at the bottom was due to some  light getting around the polarizing <br/>
sheet.  <br/>
<br/>
I also think its still a little underexposed (again, I was in a hurry,<br/>
and kind of doinked the exposure/fstop until it looked about right in <br/>
the viewscreen...)<br/>
(it would be really useful if Canon had actually allowed the user to <br/>
control all the camera's<br/>
features remotely with the software they provide).<br/>
<br/>
This can be compared to a pic just using a polarizing filter and careful <br/>
light setup (and letting<br/>
the camera (which is usually smarter than I am) do the exposure stuff):<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
and again, the above pic with the circular polarizer set to minimum <br/>
glare reduction:<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
My conclusion would be that the use of a circular polarizer to cut glare <br/>
is a no-brainer,<br/>
and that it appears that polarizing the source light has promise as <br/>
well, though I suspect<br/>
the big winner would be for trying to photograph swords, where its <br/>
almost impossible<br/>
not to get a big bloom of direct reflection off of something.  I'll <br/>
probably try that later<br/>
this weekend on my new tanto (its a wicked looking osoraku piece for <br/>
those who care...).<br/>
