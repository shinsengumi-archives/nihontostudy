<div id="ygrps-yiv-540683696">I was working on more elaborate descriptions of some tsuba I own, and had discussed a particular Deer Antler & Maple Leaf in just those terms, <br/>
<br/>
"A famous herd of tame deer has been associated with the Kasuga Shrine - Kofukuji Temple complex, founded in Nara by the Fujiwara family in 709 A.D., for centuries.  According to Shinto legend, the kami of Kashima Jinja (in modern Ibaraki Prefecture) and Katori Jinja (in Chiba Prefecture), were summoned by the head of the Fujiwara clan, and arrived riding on white deer for installation in the new shrine.  The notion of deer serving as means of passage for divinities to the world of men enters into Shinto from Taoism.  In Taoist belief, deer are the only animal able to locate the sacred Fungus of Immortality [reishi, mannendake] and live to an exceptionally old age.  Deer are, therefore, the messengers of the gods of immortality, Furukokuju and Jurojin.  By the 17th century, the antlers of the resident deer were deemed hazardous to the crowds of visitors to the temple and shrine, and the ceremonial cutting of the antlers (Shika-no-Tsunkiri) became an annual October event.  The combination of deer antler and maple is a wonderful example of the allusive seasonal imagery beloved in Japan."<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
when I finally obtained a copy of the 5th Haynes Auction Catalogue from the 1980s.  Mr. Haynes listed an almost identical tsuba, I would say clearly from the same hand, stating that these were symbols of the battles between Takeda Shingen and Uesugi Kenshin.  So I was trying to pursue that lead. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2016547582">Yes, it's not easy to see how maple leaves or deer antlers are "swift as wind, fierce as fire, immovable as mountain," or Takeda or Uesugi related.   <br/>
<br/>
Come to think of it, Milt, you were the underbidder on that very tsuba.  Haynes [sale 5: item 63] illustrates a virtually identical tsuba, differing slightly in dimensions (Haynes' is a little smaller). Also Haynes' maple leaves have gold nunome highlights, while my tsuba retains traces of red pigment.  I called mine Shoami, and described it as mid-to late Edo, while Haynes identifies his as Kyo Shoami, and attributes it specifically to Genroku.  <br/>
<br/>
If you'd like to compare them. mine is at:<br/>

<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.zincavage.org/DeerandMaple.html">http://www.zincavage.org/DeerandMaple.html</a><br/>

I'll soon be adding the Haynes picture for comparison, and modifying the text.  <br/>

Yes, I remember that well. I have a tsuba with monkey on a peach tree.<br/>
The elements are different from yours ( monkey vs deer, different <br/>
tree ), of course, but the silhouette is identical ( that is, if you <br/>
darken to obscure the detail, the two tsuba would look the same ).<br/>
