<h3>Very OT, ...</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2134189396">... but something you should be aware of.  If you are at all invested<br/>
in the stock market (and most are nowadays due to 401k and IRA<br/>
accounts and the like), you should be aware of the fraud perpetrated<br/>
at the highest levels in the equity markets.  You may have recently<br/>
heard of Gary Aguirre, a Securities and Exchange Commission<br/>
investigator who had evidence of insider trading at Pequot Capital<br/>
Management, a large hedge fund.  In his pursuit of the investigation,<br/>
he asked to subpoena the former Pequot CEO who was in charge during<br/>
the possible malfeasance.  But this person, John Mack, is a personal<br/>
friend of, and large campaign contributor to, The Prez.  And so the<br/>
insider trading investigation was terminated without explanation by<br/>
the SEC executives, and Mr. Aguirre was summarily fired, also without<br/>
explanation, and only eleven days after having received a glowing<br/>
performance evaluation and substantial salary raise.  I don't wish to<br/>
turn this board into a political rant'n'rave wastepit, and so will say<br/>
no more here.  Nor do I encourage anyone else to respond here.  I only<br/>
want to get the word out and perhaps stimulate others to get hot on<br/>
this fraud issue and perhaps address it in better suited venues.  This<br/>
incredible corruption is not a Democrat vs. Republican dynamic, the<br/>
politicians are all in it, save a few such as Rep. Ron Paul of Texas<br/>
and Senator Tom Coburn of Oklahoma.  Otherwise, they mostly all<br/>
provide political cover for the large corporations and Wall Street<br/>
firms raping the individual investors.  Here is the link to Mr.<br/>
Aguirre's testimony today to the Senate Committee on the Judiciary. <br/>
Lengthy read, but well worthwhile.  Whether you determine to do<br/>
something or just close your eyes, so be it (but no return rants here,<br/>
please).<br/>
