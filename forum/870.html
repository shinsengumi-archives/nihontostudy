<h3>London NTHK Shinsa pics</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1629611529">I'm back...<br/>

I uploaded a few photos from the London shinsa to:<br/>

<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://tinyurl.com/pyns">http://tinyurl.com/pyns</a><br/>
<br/>
Graham Curtis (the fellow reclining in the first photo) and his team did a fantastic job of organizing the event.  The shinsa team was quite busy with many interesting items from the UK, the continent and beyond.  It was nice to meet the collectors "over there" after exchanging email over the years, although unfortunately there was very little time to talk while the shinsa was under way.   If anyone has questions, please ask.<br/>
