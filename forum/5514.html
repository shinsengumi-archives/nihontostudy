This says "Mino" and not ko-Mino...and of course I can't read the rest which would be a description of motif and how it was made. I believe this work is placed in early Edo; ko-Mino would be earlier (and look different).  <br/>

agreed, I would say Mino from the late 1600's or so. In fact, the last <br/>
line of the text on the right says it was made in  江戸 前& #26399;  Edo Zenki, <br/>
zenki being the early part.<br/>
