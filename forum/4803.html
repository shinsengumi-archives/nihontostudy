<br/>
It's now a great time to plan your 2007 vacation - just open and<br/>
view the attachment.<br/>
<br/>
Here is a great opportunity to travel to Japan in April 2007 to<br/>
view and study legendary Japanese swords and weaponry.<br/>
<br/>
Visit fantastic museums that feature Japanese samurai<br/>
swords, armor, matchlock rifles and other weaponry as well as<br/>
historic Japanese castles and military museums in places such as<br/>
Tokyo, Nagoya, Osaka, Kyoto, Okayama, Hiroshima, Kumamoto<br/>
and other cities.  Everyone who has joined my tours in the past has<br/>
thoroughly enjoyed having the opportunity to go treasure hunting at<br/>
flea markets, sword stores, cutlery stores, antique shops, etc.  You<br/>
will go to places where very few Japanese sword enthusiasts in the USA<br/>
have ever been to!  At the annual Japan Custom Knife Makers Show,<br/>
you will meet skilled knifemakers as well as Japanese bladesmiths who<br/>
always attend the event.<br/>
<br/>
Now is the ideal time to make your plans for 2007 to travel to<br/>
Japan where you will see and learn so much to enhance your<br/>
knowledge of Japanese swordcraft, weaponry and history.<br/>
<br/>
Email me with any questions.  Thanks and happy new year!<br/>
