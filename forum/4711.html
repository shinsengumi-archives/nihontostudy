<h3>KTK catalogues...</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1347616279">Hi, nihontostudy members. I wanted to mention that if anyone from this list has ordered a copy of the 2006 KTK catalogue from me and I have not acknowledged it, please email me privately: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:swords@...">swords@...</a> to make sure I receive the order. <br/>
<br/>
For some reason, about 25% of my nihontostudy email goes into my spam folder and usually gets blown away when deleting those 400 daily spam! I've complained to my provider about this but the problem continues. Just wanted to mention this so nobody thinks I'm ignoring them. Thanks!<br/>
