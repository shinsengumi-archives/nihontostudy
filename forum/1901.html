<h3>Bying on ebay. Don´t get cheeted.</h3>
by <i>schrattenholz</i>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-25113647">At present you can find a Kiyosada japanese Sword with NBTHK papers <br/>
for sale on ebay. I bought this sword the 21th. of february 2004, <br/>
payed it but never received it. By request I received several other <br/>
photos of the sword and the NBTHK papers as well as copies from his <br/>
passport and driverslicense. This information is avaible for the <br/>
list if you don´t find it inconvenient. Look well at this sword on <br/>
ebay and take care of wolflady 137 and jnetweb as well as John <br/>
Pivec, Minneapolis, USA. This sword will without any doubt be put <br/>
for sale again. If anyone has this sword in their possession, please <br/>
let me know. I will award informations which will place the sword at <br/>
my house with 1000 U.S.dollars. If the Nihonto study group find it <br/>
appropiate I will put photos of the sword as well as John Pivecs <br/>
passport and driverslicense, on the list. <br/>
The Danish Criminal Police, The Danish Foreign Ministry and the USA <br/>
Police are involved in the investigation and I have asked ebay to <br/>
help with information as well.<br/>
Thankyou for your help in advance<br/>
All the best<br/>
