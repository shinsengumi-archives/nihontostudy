<h3>thoughts on Koshirae</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-165212915">Is there a preference for koshirae for certain schools of swords. To <br/>
clarify, I have a certain feeling that I should see or at least <br/>
expect to see Hizen blades in Higo koshirae. They seen to fit for <br/>
some reason unbeknownst to me. <br/>
So is there a school of koshirae that is more suited to say Yamashiro <br/>
blades, or swords of the Echizen province and things like that or is <br/>
it more just the taste of the owner. <br/>
<br/>
I was thinking that a sword from say Iwami province probably wouldn't <br/>
have Edo koshirae or Higo for that matter as they would be to far <br/>
away and the owner would select a local or more local artisan unless <br/>
they traveled or were of a higher stature and had no budget <br/>
constraints. <br/>
<br/>
any thoughts on this ?? <br/>
<br/>
cheers <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-429756917">One wonders if any Satsuma-to are featured in the Satsuma Koshirae <br/>
catalog or if we find Mito tsuba on the swords of Omura Kaboku. I think <br/>
what happened was that when a lord did Sankin-kotai and he liked to <br/>
show off, he would outfit his guys in matching koshirae. Adding some <br/>
new innovation or regional specialty would add kick. Done right these <br/>
styles would become popular with the residents of Edo and then spread <br/>
to other provinces. Thus we see Higo style stuff from other places, at <br/>
the same time Higo enjoyed a thriving business...<br/>
