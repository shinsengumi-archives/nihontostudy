<h3>Announcement: New Book on Hizento</h3>
by <i>musashibobenkei</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1510050230">I am very pleased to annouce the availability of a landmark publication on<br/>
Hizento:<br/>
<br/>
Yokoyama, Manabu. Hizento Biboroku [Hizen Sword Notebook]. Tokyo: 2006.<br/>
First edition. Manabu Yokoyama, considered by many to be a leading authority<br/>
in Japan on the swords of Hizen, has spent all his life on Hizento research,<br/>
and invested many years in the preparation of this book. A massive<br/>
Taikan-size volume of 547 pages with many oshigata and 10 color plates of<br/>
koshirae and old documents. All text in Japanese. Hard Cover with Slipcase.<br/>
New.   $375.00<br/>
<br/>
The book weighs in at over six pounds. I'll be shipping it Priority in the<br/>
US for $10 as it will fit in the USPS Flat Rate Priority box. Air shipping<br/>
to Canada will be $25 with insurance.<br/>
<br/>
I will bring at least one copy to the San Francisco Token Kai for display,<br/>
where I will also have a selection from my other inventory. I look forward<br/>
to meeting friends old and new, stop by and say hello!<br/>
<br/>
Also in stock, and worth mentioning:<br/>
<br/>
Nakamura, Nick, editor. Kokusai Tosogu Kai, 2005 International Convention &<br/>
Exhibition. Tokyo: Kokusai Tosogu Kai, 2005. First edition. 108 p. The<br/>
catalog of the first Exhibition of Kokusai Tosogu Kai, an international<br/>
group dedicated to the study and appreciation of  tosogu, or Japanese sword<br/>
fittings. Held in Louisville, Kentucky, the exhibition featured items from<br/>
Canadian and U.S., and Japanese collections. The Japanese items, most never<br/>
having been exhibited outside of Japan, were professionally photographed for<br/>
the catalog, and reproduced to the highest standards. The catalog also<br/>
features a 14 page article by Robert Haynes, "My First Sixty Years as a<br/>
Student of Kodogu," complemented by photos from his personal archives<br/>
documenting his years of study. Also included is an insightful colloquy<br/>
between Ms. Taeko Watanabe, president of the Sano Museum in Mishima, and<br/>
Terukata Kawabata,  NBTHK Director and Director of Kokusai Budo Renme<br/>
(International Martial Arts Federation) on "Sukashi Tsuba, Their Use and<br/>
Aesthetic Beauty." A beautifully produced book and a rare treat for students<br/>
of Japanese sword fittings. Limited to 600 copies. Hard Cover with Slipcase.<br/>
New.      $150.00<br/>
<br/>
Along the same lines, I have recently obtained a few copies of:<br/>
<br/>
Tanyu-kai Zuroku. Tokyo: Privately Printed, 1999. First edition. Tanyu-kai<br/>
is a private, by-invitation-only group of kodogu collectors in Japan. This<br/>
publication was done to record and showcase the best of their collections at<br/>
the time. While most of the fittings are soft metal, representing the many<br/>
schools of fittings makers, there are also a good selection of iron tsuba,<br/>
including a number of unusual high-quality Namban tsuba. 60 pages total, of<br/>
which 52 are full color very high quality photos of tsuba, menuki,<br/>
fuchi-kashira, kozuka, and kogai. Printed on very heavy paper and bound so<br/>
that each page spread lies flat. A beautiful and scarce book on which no<br/>
expense was spared. Hard Cover with Slipcase. Near Fine.      $225.00<br/>
<br/>
More books are listed on the website, and more are added all the time. Ask<br/>
if you don't see the book you're looking for, or let me know your interests.<br/>
