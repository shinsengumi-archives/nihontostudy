<h3>Menuki Thoughts?</h3>
by <i>sigp210</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-72236555">Hi all,<br/>
I recently made an offer on a set of menuki on eBay, and got them. I'm<br/>
not a fittings guy at all, but wanted a nice pair for a future<br/>
mounting project, and as an example for study.<br/>
They were described as Goto or at least waki-goto. I doubt they are <br/>
Goto...but am wondering if anyone has any thoughts on the quality,<br/>
school etc? Are there any identifying marks on menuki that might lead<br/>
towards a certain school?<br/>
Was really attracted to them because of the fine carving work, and<br/>
detail. The colour is a nice dark brownish-black shakudo, not like the<br/>
lighting in the photo shows.<br/>
They are actually nicer than in the pics..with some very fine carving,<br/>
and detail on the toes, ribs, tail etc. Some odd marks on the<br/>
legs..which are 2 ovals with a small dot in the middle.<br/>
Middle to late edo I assume? Condition is very good. Any comments from<br/>
"menuki guys" appreciated.<br/>

They're not Goto, although they are following the style.  I don't think that it is possible to attribute them to a specific group.  At shinsa work like this is often described as Kyo-Kanagushi (Kyoto metal fittings maker). <br/>

Many thanks for the reply. I had given up on the thread attracting any<br/>

are they usually just lumped into the "late edo" period?<br/>
I haven't seen a lot of info on menuki anywhere. Are there any<br/>

the things to look out for in early menuki?<br/>

<h3>Re: [nihontostudy] Re: Menuki Thoughts?</h3>
by <i>sworddad</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2113156132">Hi - <br/>
<br/>
One of my favorite articles on menuki was presented in Token Taikai, a booklet containing transcripts of eleven papers presented during the 1976 Token Taikai sponsored by the NCJSC. The late Tom Buttweiler's artice, "The History of Pre-Edo Menuki" was nicely illustrated and clearly showed the various styles of menuki that evolved during that time-frame in history. That article was a key stimulus that set me off on my fascination with early menuki. This publication would really be a worthwhile one for the NCJSC to consider reprinting one day. If not that, then perhaps the JSS/US could get permission to reprint several of these papers in their newsletter. <br/>
<br/>
Another 2-volume set of books out of Germany several years ago (1995) -- one volume on tsuba, the other on kodogu -- had a pretty good section on menuki. I'm not sure of the formal title to the "set" but it was by H. U. B. Verlag (ISBM 3-931150-00-3). Nice large photographs with the text translated into English, German and Japanese.<br/>
<br/>
In all these years I have seen only one small illustrated article that dealt with the making of menuki. That appeared in a NBTHK Token Bijutsu journal perhaps 15 years ago and showed a modern day menuki maker creating his works. Years later I tried to locate that article to get it translated, but I never did locate it again. Not much written (in depth) about menuki, so it seems. <br/>

<h3>Pin holes ?????</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1065643442">All, in this tsuba ( Owari or Kyo Shoami maybe ?? ) in the punch marks <br/>
on the face, are 3 distinct pin holes or drill holes. Are these to <br/>
enable the metal to be broken away easier when punching out the iron ?. <br/>
Seems reasonable.<br/>

The design is weights, not axe heads, btw (not your idea, I know).  The Japanese tool for splitting bamboo looks like a broken off sword (no kisaki).  A friend of mine from Higashi Hiroshima comes from a farming family and their bamboo knife is in fact a broken Masahide sword with a nice mei.<br/>

<br/>
  All, in this tsuba ( Owari or Kyo Shoami maybe ?? ) in the punch marks <br/>
  on the face, are 3 distinct pin holes or drill holes. Are these to <br/>
  enable the metal to be broken away easier when punching out the iron ?. <br/>
  Seems reasonable.<br/>

Being a pretty late one it's hard to say, but it's more Shoami than Owari.  I don't know what the motif means, but some time spent with the usual books might turn something up.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1951185709">The weight (fundo) was one of the Myriad Treasures (takaramono) associated with the Seven Gods of Good Luck, who carry them in a sack. As such it is an auspicious symbol.  Perhaps the bamboo is split open  to demonstrate that it is empty (in the positive Taoist/Buddhist sense) at its core, as a samurai opens his belly to disclose his sincerity.  <br/>

 Those sorts of holes are sometimes seen on tsuba that have been<br/>
recycled at least once in the West. It was once distressingly common to<br/>
wire, sometimes solder, tsuba to some sort of frame or mesh for<br/>
"decorative" purposes.<br/>

Could be, I can't see enough in the photo to tell.  I would have thought an Edo period piece from the look of it, but if there are tekkotsu it could be earlier.  The curved bamboo at the top is a nice design variation.<br/>
