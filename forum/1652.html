<h3>Something to look forward to in October</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-724193056">FYI- a response I got from the Musuem of Fine arts in<br/>
Boston<br/>
<br/>
Dear Mr. Wilson,<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for your interest in our collection of<br/>
Japanese swords and sword fittings.  There is a slight<br/>
misunderstanding as it is the museum's collection of<br/>
kodogu that has recently been catalogued, not the<br/>
swords, but I am pleased to tell you that a<br/>
publication of about 150 pieces will be published next<br/>
October.  At the same time we will have a display from<br/>
the catalogue as well as other pieces of Meiji<br/>
metalwork that relates to some of our later kodogu.  <br/>
<br/>
I hope you will be able to come to Boston to see the<br/>
exhibition, it will be on view for about a year and<br/>
the catalogue will be sold in the museum shop, and I<br/>
imagine on-line as well.  Also I'm pleased to tell you<br/>
that at the time of publication of all the pieces from<br/>
the collection, which have been photographed for this<br/>
project,  will be available through the museum's<br/>
website.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
