<h3>questions about my tanto</h3>
by <i>sueb262</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1381096710">Hi, all!  <br/>
<br/>
I've been a "lurker" here for quite a while, just so I could learn a little from listening to the conversations (which I have, thanks!), but now I have a question of my own.<br/>
<br/>
When my uncle was billeted with a Japanese family during the occupation, they gave him a tanto.  My uncle is now gone, but I have come into possession of that tanto.  However, I don't know anything about it, although I'm trying to find someone to whom I could take it who would know how to identify/analyze it (no luck yet).<br/>
<br/>
I wonder if any of you could take the time to look at the pictures I have of it and tell me what you can about it?  I'd appreciate any info/ideas about how old it is, what "school" it might be from (if any), or anything else.<br/>
<br/>
Here's the link to my flickr account:<br/>

<br/>
I'd appreciate any thoughts.  Thanks!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-807660998">Hi Sue, nice to hear from you. This is a Naval dagger, a dress dagger <br/>
that was worn by Japanese Naval Officers. They sometime came with <br/>
genuine tanto in them, perhaps a family heirloom the office wanted to <br/>
carry into battle, but mostly they came with a mass produce blade which <br/>
was for the most part practical as a weapon, but not genuine Nihonto <br/>
(traditionally made Japanese sword).<br/>
<br/>
Tell the group where you are (state/city) and perhaps someone close by <br/>
can have a look for you ?<br/>
<br/>
A quick look here will give you a little more info<br/>

where are you located? if one of us are in your area we could arrange to see it. The tanto is a Navy officer's dirk, they were made from early 1900's through WWII. Some had hand made blades but most had machine made blades. If you google Japanese Navy Dirk you might see others like yours. Not sure what else you need, let us know<br/>

<br/>
And what you say squares with something I remember him mentioning: he said that the family told him this was a "family heirloom", so maybe it has the kind of blade you mention.  When I looked at it, I wondered whether it had been a bigger blade at some point.  I actually "know" almost nothing about blades, although I am fascinated by them, but something about the proportions seemed a bit like that to me.  <br/>
<br/>
I'd love it if someone knew how to remove the hilt and look at the nakago(correct word?) to see if there are any identifying markings on it.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your response!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-438820438">So I looked at the link you provided, and that first picture and description ("Naval Officers dirks") looks almost exactly like mine.  That's probably what this one is.  That description says that they were first issued in the 1880's, so maybe it is just old enough that it had been "handed down" one generation or something (making it an "heirloom").  I didn't see anything that could be considered a hamon, but I also figured I didn't really know what I was looking for/at.<br/>
