<br/>
Rich is right. Many of us have tried a few things over the years but mostly without satisfactory results. We hate to say to try something that's not going to give you the correct results. One of the best results I've ever had was when a friend of mine would offer to wear a tsuba around his neck for awhile. He worked in a gym and his body sweat (ugh) worked wonders on some tsuba and didn't work on others (depending on the steel). Personally, I've never tried to used one of the traditional formula that can be found. <br/>

Ancient coins...sounds interesting! <br/>

  Hi Kim, I don't think anyone will answer that, an inherently dangerous <br/>
  question that could only lead to tears. You will be told 99.9% of the <br/>
  time, it is best left to the experts.<br/>
<br/>
  So the answer would be, We DON'T repatinate parts of our swords, we send <br/>
  them to polishers and they do it.<br/>
<br/>
  cheers<br/>
