<h3>Los Angeles study group</h3>
by <i>steven_88_2000</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1785152664">Greetings all,<br/>
<br/>
Just wondering if there are any Southern California study group <br/>
members here, and whether it is known if the group is meeting <br/>
tomorrow (November 12th).  I am new to the group, and <br/>
understand that meetings are usually the second friday of every <br/>
month, but I wanted to be sure that this month's meeting is <br/>
happening as "scheduled."  Any info on this is appreciated.  <br/>
Thanks.</div>

<h3>crass commercial message</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-931694988">All, I currently have full set of Toso Kodogu Koza for sale. All 8 <br/>
volumes in mint condition ( book 5 has a small amount of foxing, more a <br/>
little stain on the outside of the pages ) All in cardboard sleeves. <br/>
These will be going up on Ebay soon so I thought I'd off them here <br/>
first. These books are for the advanced kodogu collector and are in <br/>
Japanese. Excellent images of many tsuba, kozuka and other kodogu.<br/>
<br/>
If your interested in them and want to discuss the price or want some <br/>
photo's, email me at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:ikkanshi@...">ikkanshi@...</a><br/>
<br/>
cheers<br/>

 It is <<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:stevey@...">stevey@...</a>>. In case you haven't reached him he<br/>

 I am sorry I could not make that Shizuoka trip with you as I would like<br/>

<br/>
Yes, I am trying to figure out how to buy it,m and I was able to <br/>
contact Steve. I had seen the blade before it was polished and also <br/>
OKed it for Yushu-saku. It is a very fine piece and I hope I can figure <br/>
out a way to put the money together. The Sano trip was, as always, a <br/>
real pleasure. Watanabe sensei got me to do some translation work for <br/>
her, and she put out some very fine pieces. I particularly like the <br/>
Chu-Aoe blade. If you remember Okada san's Yosazaemon Sukesada katana <br/>
we brought over last year, the Aoe blade looked just like it -- only <br/>
better. It was pretty clear seeing that blade that Yosazaemon was <br/>
copying the Chu-Aoe style of workmanship down to the shape of the <br/>
blade. Anyway, there will always be a next time.<br/>
