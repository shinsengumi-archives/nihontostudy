<div id="ygrps-yiv-76054945">Hello again ,<br/>
<br/>
     I am a lurker here, and a member over at SFI.<br/>
<br/>
 A member was again contacted by this guy. I can't recall who it was <br/>
working in concert with the Polish authorities, but told the SFI <br/>
member I would forward the E-mail.<br/>
<br/>
    Thanks ,<br/>

 [Quote]    Bumpin' this thread because I´ve received another email <br/>
from our beloved friend:<br/>
<br/>
Dear Sir:<br/>
<br/>
I have a Japanese sword (katana) with the XVIII century blade and I <br/>
would<br/>
like to sell it for the fee of 400$. I have all the papers which <br/>
shows I am<br/>
a curent holder of this item. If you think you could have any <br/>
interest in<br/>
such antique item, please let me know.<br/>
<br/>
With respect.<br/>
