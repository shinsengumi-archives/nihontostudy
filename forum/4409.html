<h3>Edo period Tosho tsuba</h3>
by <i>retalt</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1578004277">Hi all, it is a bit quiet here so I thought I might run this past <br/>
people. Did swordsmiths, that made tsuba, sign any differently compared <br/>
to their sword mei ?. Did that have different designations ?, or use <br/>
alternate titles ?, and are there any records, i.e. references or books <br/>
showing Tosho tsuba mei ?.<br/>
<br/>
I have seen various mei on tsuba by Masahide, Naotsuna, Naokatasu and <br/>
they are close, though the papered Naokatsu I have seen show some <br/>
differences. I have also recently come into possession of tsuba signed <br/>
Yasutsugu and Daido. I am looking at buying a Naokatsu tsuba when I am <br/>
in Japan next month.<br/>
<br/>
Some of the greatest mid/late Edo sword smiths had a hand at making <br/>
tsuba and it appears that they, for the most part, did an excellent job. <br/>
I would be interested in any material, references and articles on this <br/>
subject. I have Roberts Haynes' information in the Tsuba, an Aesthetic <br/>
guide and Nihonto Koza but would also like to read anything else that <br/>
might be about the place.<br/>

I think tosho signed with much the same signature they used on blades although as the kanji are very small the cutting might be different.<br/>
<br/>
If you are thinking about fake tosho signatures on tsuba, I have never heard of this happening although we did have a Shinkai tsuba in Christie's last sale which was not believed.<br/>
<br/>
There is not a lot in the books as the tsuba are not considered as being of much importance.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2147369792">Hi Alan, thanks for that information. I guess thoughts of gimei spring <br/>
to mind. I am curious as to the worth of some of these guards, I have a <br/>
link to a tsuba by Suishinshi Masahide that is considered I think quite <br/>
important. I have linked a scan of the information here<br/>

I find these guard quite interesting and wonder if for example, Masahide <br/>
and his students, being the traditionalists that they were and working <br/>
in the old Koto ways, liked to do the full bit, as in make tsuba for <br/>
some of their swords as well ?? just like the old Tosho did.<br/>
<br/>
Just speculating.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1506250267">Hi Rich,<br/>
The trouble with these late tosho is that all they seem to make are the Nobuie revival type which can be a bit boring, although if they are good enough to copy the Nobuie glazed surface they are more interesting.<br/>
