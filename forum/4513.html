<h3>O-Tanto?</h3>
by <i>bh325</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1967870564">Hello all,<br/>
<br/>
I am a new member, I am looking for information on a Japanese edged<br/>
weapon that was gifted to me rather unexpectedly. I would like to find<br/>
out as much information as I can about it, I suspect it may be a WWII<br/>
era officer's weapon or it may be older than that. The blade polish<br/>
has been completely destroyed, and the edge has been dulled. The tsuba<br/>
is tarnished and much of the silver/gold decoration is missing. What I<br/>
know about it:<br/>
<br/>
The blade is between 16-17 inches from end of tang to tip. It is<br/>
curved, but the handle is nearly straight. The handle itself has been<br/>
re-wrapped and re-covered with rayskin, and two spacers have been<br/>
added between the Habaki and the tsuba, and the tsuba and the handle<br/>
collar. These are not original, they look like they were taken from a<br/>
much larger weapon. There is no idication of a hamon. The Habaki looks<br/>
original and is copper, polished on top with diagonal file marks at<br/>
the bottom and on the sides. <br/>
<br/>
The handle collar is copper and is marked with three symbols, two<br/>
characters and a "flower" that is composed of a central circle and<br/>
three semi-circular lobes. The handle cap is horn, and is original by<br/>
my information. <br/>
<br/>
There are characters chisled into the tang, I attempted to take a<br/>
rubbing but it wasn't successful. They are only one one side, but the<br/>
reverse side has two small triangular notches near the top of the tang.<br/>
<br/>
I realize that no one would be able to tell much from the words, but<br/>
maybe someone can inform me on how to best record and display the<br/>
needed markings/information that would allow identification or any<br/>
other information to be determined. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance.</div>

You have done a good job describing it, though a<br/>
picture tells alot. If it is not possible or practical<br/>
to take a picture, you might consider taking it to a<br/>
sword club near you.<br/>
<br/>
Given the size and curvature of the blade, it is<br/>
probably a wakizashi or a naginata-naoshi (a halberd<br/>
like weapon that has been cut down to make an oversize<br/>
tanto. "O-tanto" basically is a large or oversized<br/>
tanto). The mounts sound fine to me. Many of these<br/>
came back as souevinirs with WW2 veterans. As they<br/>
played with them over the years, parts <handles,<br/>
seppas, etc> got mixed and matched.<br/>
<br/>
Don't mess with the blade using any cleaning<br/>
chemicals. Despite the polish being gone and the edge<br/>
destroyed, there may be some life left to it.<br/>
<br/>
Please share in what state or country you live, and we<br/>
will try to point you to a nearby sword society or<br/>
club.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2137913854">Hi Ben,<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
What you have is a wakizashi. The signature reads Sanjo Munechika saku.<br/>
From the quality of the mounts and etc., I am pretty confident that you have<br/>
a sword manufactured for the export market, typically in Kuwana or some<br/>
other local area, and then sent to Yokohama to provide an inexpensive, but<br/>
very exotic souvenir for some clipper ship crewman and etc. From an artistic<br/>
and historical level, such swords are not very important. Nonetheless, they<br/>
make nice wall hangers. For the veterans, everyone knows who Sanjo Munechika<br/>
is, so there is no need to explain more, but for the newbies, most of these<br/>
export swords have the names  not signatures  of big named smiths. Sanjo<br/>
Munechika is a Heian period smith who is basically the founder of the<br/>
Yamashiro tradition. This use of big names is sort of like a street artist<br/>
signing his chalk rendered Rembrandts with Rembrandts name. No one would<br/>
mistake this for Munechikas work, it just adds a bit of interest.<br/>

<br/>
Thank you for the photos.<br/>
Gordon seems to have said most of what I could say, in<br/>
that the wakizashi is not by "Munechika" but rather<br/>
probably a late 1800s blade made for export.<br/>
<br/>
I see a small mune-ware in the photos that says to me<br/>
the wakizashi may be of classical construction. Hence<br/>
it is possible it was an older (but not much older)<br/>
wakizashi which had the tang reworked and a false<br/>
signature added. With the sword market hitting rock<br/>
bottom during those times, it would have been probably<br/>
easier and/or cheaper to rework an unsigned wakizashi<br/>
than go to the trouble of classically constructing<br/>
one. Hence a famous name was added.<br/>
<br/>
It is unlikely the blade merits the monetary expense<br/>
of polish, but you can learn from it. The tsuba is a<br/>
nice little Higo province type thing, and has some<br/>
minor value to it.<br/>
<br/>
I live in Florida and am a wee bit East Coast centric,<br/>
so regretably I do not know any sword clubs in<br/>
Arizona. Several fittings collectors live out that<br/>
way. I believe the moderator of this list (Jim<br/>
Gilbert) also lived in Arizona for a while and might<br/>
be able to direct you to local people that can tell<br/>
you more about the wakizashi.<br/>
    My first Nihonto was a wakizashi very similar to<br/>
yours. I wish I'd kept the menuki from it. Not<br/>
valuable, but very unique. I've never seen another<br/>
pair like them.<br/>

traveling through the Phoenix airport and waiting for my flight, I<br/>
observed a exhibition of about two or three small kiosks displaying a<br/>
total of maybe twenty or so swords.  I remember thinking that I had<br/>
vaguely read or heard of the involved metallurgy in Japanese swords,<br/>
but, upon seeing the real McCoy for the first time, then thinking,<br/>
"Wow!  I had no idea.  These things are really neat!"  A wet mackerel<br/>
to the side of the head, for sure.  I've oft wondered who or what<br/>
organization put on that display.  It was sometime in the later '80s,<br/>
I think.  I wonder who I should thank, or blame, for source<br/>
responsibility as to my pissing away a goodly share of my<br/>
discretionary income ever since.  ;o)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2038290974">Thanks to everyone for your help with this. I will keep studying this <br/>
piece and doing research.<br/>
<br/>
One last question, though - If this was a "replica", would there be a <br/>
hamon, or would it just be uniformly treated? I have some experience <br/>
with polishing, and would like to learn the Japanese methods to <br/>
supplement my Western knifemaking skills. Would it be worth the time to <br/>
try to polish the blade, and does anyone know where I might be able to <br/>
purchase Japanese polishing supplies?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
