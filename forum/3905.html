<div id="ygrps-yiv-366318124">This guard is a well known Yagyu tsuba.  It has been published in Token Bijutsu and in the Solingen museum catalog.  It was displayed in the US at last year's San Francisco NBTHK AB presentation.  This design appears in the Yagyu family design book, in the later unnumbered section.  I added a scan from Bob Haynes' copy of the design book here:<br/>

<br/>
Yagyu tsuba were made by several different groups, so in a sense it is the design that makes it Yagyu.  However, the guards do tend to share similar metal and construction.  The sandy or cloudy texture of the metal is a key characteristic.  This guard does not show its thin laminations clearly in the rim, but the layers can be seen inside the sukashi openings.  The linear tekkotsu is a result of this laminated construction.  The metal is consistent with an early Edo period date.<br/>
<br/>
The small size and thick, square rim are also typical of Yagyu tsuba.  The somewhat blurry definition of the sukashi and the rounded edges are also typical.  Several people remarked on the small hitsuana, which are not typical of Yagyu.  I think that this is because they are constrained by the sukashi design.  <br/>
<br/>
Older books describe the motif as "cut necks," a string of trophy heads.  More recent interpretations include a string of rice cakes, Buddhist rosary beads (juzu) and thunder drums (raiko).<br/>
<br/>
The Ono are one of the groups that manufactured Yagyu tsuba, so that is a reasonable bid.  Some of their work is similar in size and style of metal.<br/>
<br/>
Early Hoan will usually have a more clear, melted finish to the metal, and it will not have a sandy texture.  They will show bump type tekkotsu like Yamakichibei rather than linear bones.  It would also be an unusual design for Hoan.  Some Yagyu guards may have been made by Hoan workers.  Again, these are all guards from the Owari region and they do have a similar flavor.  <br/>

LOL. If the Yagyu book comes out soon ( is that the NBTHK ) from your <br/>
exhibition, I will be up to date. Another great write up and much <br/>
appreciated.<br/>

I expected that the display book from the SF show would be available in time for the Tampa show, but the guy who handles the publishing was still tweaking the work at the printer to improve the quality. They should be ready for Chicago in May.  Past books on blades looked very good, so it'll be interesting to see the improvement.  Yes, it's the NBTHK American branch that's producing it.  It will also cover the swords that were on display.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1558981916">excellent, I have the Masamune one they produced last year ( or year <br/>
before ) that big Tom Helm was good enough to get for me. I look forward <br/>
to this one eagerly as well. I am just going to have to make room for a <br/>
trip to the SF show one day soon I think.<br/>
