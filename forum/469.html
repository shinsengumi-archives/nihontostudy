<h3>Round 2</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1784286601">Hey, may as well jump in here and ask about my tanto also. Please <br/>
refer to the Photos section at left, in the NC folder. The tanto is <br/>
signed Bishu Osafune Kiyo(mitsu?) and Eiroku jyu ichi (nen?) (?) <br/>
gatsu hi (1568). Q #1: Is it indeed kazu uchimono? Seems so, given <br/>
the Bishu vs. Bizen mei, the date, plus it also has a lot of loose <br/>
hada and forging ware. Q #2: Any idea as to which Kiyomitsu made <br/>
it? Q #3: Is it common for kazu uchimono of this area and time to <br/>
have loads of utsuri and nijuba/sanjuba as does this example? That <br/>
is, while the forging was apparently quick and dirty, it appears that <br/>
this blade got the full professional tempering treatment. Possibly <br/>
the smiths were so used to doing the tempering correctly that they <br/>
just did it as a matter of course, even for bundled blades? Thanks <br/>
in advance for any and all input!<br/>
