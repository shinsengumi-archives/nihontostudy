You can submit the entire tsuka.<br/>
If any element is false (gimei FK, cast menuki)it will not pass.<br/>
If all is proper it will paper as "Tsuka mae".<br/>
The mei of the FK will be noted.<br/>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-434197523">I think that they went out of fashion is indeed a much more plausible<br/>
explanation....... however it is always fun to think about what might<br/>
have been. Continuing the subject of Kanayama tsuba, would you say that<br/>
the 'quite large seppa dai in proportion to the rest of the guard'<br/>
feature on this type of tsuba is a kantei point? For some reason they<br/>
all seem to have a larger seppa dai in relation to the rest of the<br/>
design than most other tsuba. <br/>
 <br/>
Other kantei points would be the type of steel, the color, the tekkotsu,<br/>
the designs used (often hard to figure out what they represent) etc. <br/>
 <br/>
Am I missing any here?<br/>
 <br/>
I seem to be getting the knack of distinguishing what is what with all<br/>
these different tsuba :- / but that is only because I have spent ages<br/>
and ages looking at all kinds of stuff and remembering what such and<br/>
such looked like an what school it was. Now I am trying to pinpoint<br/>
specific features to help attribute guards more correctly and date them.<br/>
Much like you would do with porcleain with decorative motives and the<br/>
paste of the porcelain. <br/>

Good to hear your voice on the list again.<br/>
<br/>
Based on my limited experience with overseas NTHK shinsa, the criteria are similar.  One difference is that submissions for koshirae shinsa, including tsuka-only submissions, will have the signatures of the kodogu elements noted where visible, but will not get attributions of maker or time period for any unsigned kodogu elements.  <br/>
<br/>
So, Milt's tsuka, if genuine, would be described in detail as to materials, carving and inlay techniques, decorative motifs, and be measured and photographed, but would not receive maker attributions for the menuki or fuchigashira.  A date and point value for the koshirae as a unit will be provided, but not for the individual kodogu elements.  <br/>
<br/>
Agreed that a tsuba and tsuka without a saya is not an appropriate submission for koshirae shinsa.<br/>
<br/>
A customer can submit a complete koshirae for shinsa and then, for example, submit the mumei tsuba separately as kodogu if an attribution of maker, time period and point value is desired.  This requires two submissions, though.<br/>
<br/>
An advantage of overseas shinsa is that we can immediately contact the owner of the item if there is a problem with the submission.  For example, if a tsuka is submitted for koshirae shinsa and the fuchigashira are genuine but the menuki are reproductions, we will track down the owner and advise him that the item will fail as koshirae due to the menuki, but that if he would like to change the submission (no additional charge) to kodogu shinsa of the fuchigashira, it can be certified.  We "saved" a nice Omori Teruhide F/K this way.<br/>

<br/>
As an example, I have a tsuka with nice doe skin wrap and what I believe to be Jingo iron fuchi/kashira and menuki. If this opinion is correct (Jingo), having the fittings "in hand" would show them to be mumei anyway. Do you think a shinsa team would make the call to Jingo in a case like this? I've often wondered about submitting this tsuka but that's yet to be done. (Perhaps you saw this tsuba somewhere over the years.)<br/>

<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
This is good timing as I wanted to warn Chicago shinsa attendees about<br/>
submitting koshirae. If you submit a tsuka, then the same will apply as with<br/>
the NBTHK. Make sure that the tsuka has not been re-wrapped in the last 100<br/>
or so years - that means it is no longer antique and will be bounced. Entire<br/>
koshirae will be judged based on authenticity and age of all the pieces,<br/>
i.e. nothing replaced, re-wrapped or re-lacquered. Also, if pieces are<br/>
mumei, they will not be attributed. You must submit the pieces separately<br/>
for that. If all or some of the pieces are signed, then they will be<br/>
authenticated. <br/>

<br/>
Cary,<br/>
Good to hear your voice on the list again.<br/>
<br/>
Based on my limited experience with overseas NTHK shinsa, the criteria are<br/>
similar.  One difference is that submissions for koshirae shinsa, including<br/>
tsuka-only submissions, will have the signatures of the kodogu elements<br/>
noted where visible, but will not get attributions of maker or time period<br/>
for any unsigned kodogu elements.  <br/>
<br/>
So, Milt's tsuka, if genuine, would be described in detail as to materials,<br/>
carving and inlay techniques, decorative motifs, and be measured and<br/>
photographed, but would not receive maker attributions for the menuki or<br/>
fuchigashira.  A date and point value for the koshirae as a unit will be<br/>
provided, but not for the individual kodogu elements.  <br/>
<br/>
Agreed that a tsuba and tsuka without a saya is not an appropriate<br/>
submission for koshirae shinsa.<br/>
<br/>
A customer can submit a complete koshirae for shinsa and then, for example,<br/>
submit the mumei tsuba separately as kodogu if an attribution of maker, time<br/>
period and point value is desired.  This requires two submissions, though.<br/>
<br/>
An advantage of overseas shinsa is that we can immediately contact the owner<br/>
of the item if there is a problem with the submission.  For example, if a<br/>
tsuka is submitted for koshirae shinsa and the fuchigashira are genuine but<br/>
the menuki are reproductions, we will track down the owner and advise him<br/>
that the item will fail as koshirae due to the menuki, but that if he would<br/>
like to change the submission (no additional charge) to kodogu shinsa of the<br/>
fuchigashira, it can be certified.  We "saved" a nice Omori Teruhide F/K<br/>
this way.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  Milt,<br/>
  I cannot speak for the NTHK.<br/>
  Jim will be able to answer the shinsa criteria for fittings.<br/>
<br/>
  My experience with the NBTHK is:<br/>
  You can submit the entire tsuka.<br/>
  If any element is false (gimei FK, cast menuki)it will not pass.<br/>
  If all is proper it will paper as "Tsuka mae".<br/>
  The mei of the FK will be noted.<br/>
  If there is no mei it will likely be attributed.<br/>
<br/>
  The tsuba will require a separate submission.<br/>
<br/>
  Twofer's include Daisho Tsuba, Daisho FKs, or Menuki,<br/>
  Futokoro or Mitokoromono, and of course Daisho koshirae.<br/>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1142284760">Ron,<br/>
There is a spot on the NTHK koshirae worksheet for an attribution of the complete unit to a maker, but I've not seen it used for anything mumei.  I'm not sure that it's meaningful to talk about a Jingo koshirae, or for that matter a Goto koshirae, even if all of the fittings are by one of those makers.<br/>
<br/>
If the fuchigashira were submitted for kodogu shinsa (while mounted) I don't think that there would be any problem getting a Jingo attribution if that's what they are.  I don't think I've seen the tsuka, but it sounds nice.  If it turned out to be later generation Jingo, it would get a "kodai" qualifier, as with the Yagyu tsuba that Cary mentioned yesterday.<br/>
<br/>
Jim<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  Hi Jim - <br/>
<br/>
  As an example, I have a tsuka with nice doe skin wrap and what I believe to be Jingo iron fuchi/kashira and menuki. If this opinion is correct (Jingo), having the fittings "in hand" would show them to be mumei anyway. Do you think a shinsa team would make the call to Jingo in a case like this? I've often wondered about submitting this tsuka but that's yet to be done. (Perhaps you saw this tsuba somewhere over the years.)<br/>

<h3>Re: [nihontostudy] Kanayama tsuba?</h3>
by <i>yamaimojg</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-857126839">Matt,<br/>
I think that the metal and the tekkotsu are the first points for Kanayama.  The distinctive motifs would place second (or is that third).  Not all Kanayama guards have wide seppa dai.  Earthlink has told me that my site has already exceeded its bandwidth allotment (it's happening earlier and earlier in the month), but it hasn't been shut down yet, so quickly check:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://home.earthlink.net/~jggilbert/kanayama.htm">http://home.earthlink.net/~jggilbert/kanayama.htm</a><br/>
<br/>
Some of them have rather narrow seppa dai.<br/>
<br/>
You're following the right process.  <br/>
Jim<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  I think that they went out of fashion is indeed a much more plausible<br/>
  explanation....... however it is always fun to think about what might<br/>
  have been. Continuing the subject of Kanayama tsuba, would you say that<br/>
  the 'quite large seppa dai in proportion to the rest of the guard'<br/>
  feature on this type of tsuba is a kantei point? For some reason they<br/>
  all seem to have a larger seppa dai in relation to the rest of the<br/>
  design than most other tsuba. <br/>
<br/>
  Other kantei points would be the type of steel, the color, the tekkotsu,<br/>
  the designs used (often hard to figure out what they represent) etc. <br/>
<br/>
  Am I missing any here?<br/>
<br/>
  I seem to be getting the knack of distinguishing what is what with all<br/>
  these different tsuba :- / but that is only because I have spent ages<br/>
  and ages looking at all kinds of stuff and remembering what such and<br/>
  such looked like an what school it was. Now I am trying to pinpoint<br/>
  specific features to help attribute guards more correctly and date them.<br/>
  Much like you would do with porcleain with decorative motives and the<br/>
  paste of the porcelain. <br/>

  Matt,<br/>
  The short answer is that I don't know.  <br/>
<br/>
  But, I tend to doubt it.  The Norisuke working in the 19th C produced<br/>
  tekkotsu at will and in their copies sometimes exaggerated them beyond<br/>
  what was in the originals.  Good Kanayama work is still more attractive,<br/>
  but how much of that is because of raw material vs. technique vs.<br/>
  intent?<br/>
<br/>
  It's quite possible that Kanayama guards simply went out of style.  The<br/>
  aesthetic trend in the Edo period moved away from the tastes of the<br/>
  Muromachi and Momoyama in paintings, ceramics, etc., as well as sword<br/>
  fittings. <br/>
  Jim<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
    Gang, how much truth is there to the theory that the Kanayama tsuba<br/>
    makers used a 'special secret iron ore known only the them and<br/>
  probably<br/>
    close to where they worked' that produced the wonderful tekkotsu<br/>
  effects<br/>
    in their tsuba? And that when the when they ran out of this particular<br/>
    iron ore the school ceased to exist?<br/>

around about 1624 ... a bunch of things were banned at that point. Red<br/>
saya specifically, red clothing if I remember correctly, maybe at this<br/>
point katana on non-samurai. I don't recall there being any exceptions<br/>
to the list, but doesn't mean that there wasn't one. <br/>

Matt,<br/>
I think that the metal and the tekkotsu are the first points for<br/>
Kanayama.  The distinctive motifs would place second (or is that third).<br/>
Not all Kanayama guards have wide seppa dai.  Earthlink has told me that<br/>
my site has already exceeded its bandwidth allotment (it's happening<br/>
earlier and earlier in the month), but it hasn't been shut down yet, so<br/>
quickly check:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://home.earthlink.net/~jggilbert/kanayama.htm">http://home.earthlink.net/~jggilbert/kanayama.htm</a><br/>
<br/>
Some of them have rather narrow seppa dai.<br/>
<br/>
You're following the right process.  <br/>
Jim<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  I think that they went out of fashion is indeed a much more plausible<br/>
  explanation....... however it is always fun to think about what might<br/>
  have been. Continuing the subject of Kanayama tsuba, would you say<br/>
that<br/>
  the 'quite large seppa dai in proportion to the rest of the guard'<br/>
  feature on this type of tsuba is a kantei point? For some reason they<br/>
  all seem to have a larger seppa dai in relation to the rest of the<br/>
  design than most other tsuba. <br/>
<br/>
  Other kantei points would be the type of steel, the color, the<br/>
tekkotsu,<br/>
  the designs used (often hard to figure out what they represent) etc. <br/>
<br/>
  Am I missing any here?<br/>
<br/>
  I seem to be getting the knack of distinguishing what is what with all<br/>
  these different tsuba :- / but that is only because I have spent ages<br/>
  and ages looking at all kinds of stuff and remembering what such and<br/>
  such looked like an what school it was. Now I am trying to pinpoint<br/>
  specific features to help attribute guards more correctly and date<br/>
them.<br/>
  Much like you would do with porcleain with decorative motives and the<br/>
  paste of the porcelain. <br/>

<br/>
  Matt,<br/>
  The short answer is that I don't know.  <br/>
<br/>
  But, I tend to doubt it.  The Norisuke working in the 19th C produced<br/>
  tekkotsu at will and in their copies sometimes exaggerated them beyond<br/>
  what was in the originals.  Good Kanayama work is still more<br/>
attractive,<br/>
  but how much of that is because of raw material vs. technique vs.<br/>
  intent?<br/>
<br/>
  It's quite possible that Kanayama guards simply went out of style.<br/>
The<br/>
  aesthetic trend in the Edo period moved away from the tastes of the<br/>
  Muromachi and Momoyama in paintings, ceramics, etc., as well as sword<br/>
  fittings. <br/>
  Jim<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
    Gang, how much truth is there to the theory that the Kanayama tsuba<br/>
    makers used a 'special secret iron ore known only the them and<br/>
  probably<br/>
    close to where they worked' that produced the wonderful tekkotsu<br/>
  effects<br/>
    in their tsuba? And that when the when they ran out of this<br/>
particular<br/>
    iron ore the school ceased to exist?<br/>

like this. I had been thinking like with sword damage, it could get<br/>
rejected (no boshi, interrupted hamon, etc.)<br/>

A personal dilemma. Last March I've purchased a beautiful mumei katana with fantastic (really!) horimono. It came with koshirae which had damage. I've had the sword put into shirazaya and a tsunagi made for the koshirae with repairs, on-going. Because the tsuka wrapping was literally falling apart, the fuchi/kashira and menuki were removed and therefore, able to be examined in-hand. The menuki are solid gold "dragons" which are super! The fuchi/kashira (mumei) are even more fine and really do cry for shinsa with an eye toward Goto. The kozuka/kogai looked "mainline Goto" but drew (reportedly) a generic "Goto den" call from the NBTHK. <br/>
<br/>
My dilemma, should these wonderful fitting be placed back on the sword or be kept seperately and "boxed" for individual preservation and appreciation. I say "dilemma" but in all honesty my choice has been made; they will be boxed for individual in-hand appreciation. So, should I feel bad to have in a sense "destroyed" a koshirae or should I feel good to have discovered these wonderful kodogu. Granted, the koshirae was not truly a (and I hate this expression) "matching" koshirae and was really "put together" by it pre-war owner. Yes, I'll keep the saya and (unmounted) tsuka together with a tsunagi but it seems such a waste to put these beautiful fitting back on it where they can be damaged (f/k, kozuka/kogai) or hidden under ito (menuki). <br/>
<br/>
After saying all this I'm not too sure where I'm going with it, but my point might be that there is a time to "preserve" a koshirae" and a time to not worry about it. <br/>

  I think if you look at museum collections in Japan, the answer is there.<br/>
  They do not touch anything no matter the condition. If the wrap is coming<br/>
  off, it is coming off. They may add something to secure menuki and such to<br/>
  keep them in place - typically thread. The same goes with lacquer, it is not<br/>
  touched. Thus, the standards for shinsa are the same. I am pretty sure this<br/>
  is the case with the NBTHK as well. So, what to do to repair something? If<br/>
  you want to keep the piece original and unaltered, you must have all new<br/>
  mounts made and you set aside the original pieces. I know this may seem to<br/>
  be unreasonable, but those are the very high standards that have been<br/>
  maintained at shinsa and in museums. I think the same holds true for antique<br/>
  firearms. Re-blued barrels, re-done stocks and what not seriously harm the<br/>
  value of the piece. Thus, such alterations should not be done lightly.<br/>

<h3>RE: [nihontostudy] shinsa question</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-248223418">Ron,<br/>
<br/>
I have thought about this alot and only recently have<br/>
come to a conclusion.  Given my desire for only mantis<br/>
themed items, I couldn't decide to mount them or not<br/>
(one day when I do remount a sword or 2).  I came to<br/>
the conclusion that I enjoy seeing all these items<br/>
grouped together in my display table and having them<br/>
all together makes them available for quick study.  I<br/>
therefore decided not to mount them (my mantis items).<br/>
 On the other hand I decided when I do remount some<br/>
swords, that I may choose a secondary theme like<br/>
fishing (other passion of mine) to mount in.  I may<br/>
also just opt for just a shirasaya but have recently<br/>
been leaning toward a bit nicer of a display (matching<br/>
fittings, handle wrap, etc).  When I view my items it<br/>
is usually just the swords or just fittings, depends<br/>
on my mood.  I also know that I am unique in that I<br/>
collect 1 theme, although there are many others like<br/>
me out there.  However, if I were to find a sword with<br/>
all mantis fittings,  I would keep it together.  1<br/>
tsuba on a sword would most likely be stripped and<br/>
replaced with something else, especially if I didn't<br/>
have that tsuba school represented.  I wonder if guys<br/>
into iado/ sword practitioners or musuem guys (Gordon)<br/>
view the whole package ,sword, fittings, saya, etc as<br/>
one, while I tend to view it in terms of seperate<br/>
entities.  I'm rambling here so I'll stop.  It all<br/>
comes down to Personal preference- no right or wrong.<br/>

<h3>Re: [nihontostudy] Kanayama tsuba?</h3>
by <i>yamaimojg</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1509064439">Matt,<br/>
Easy question first -- the usual translation of tekkotsu is "iron bones."  Don't think of a dry skeleton here, it's more like the look of your knuckle bones and skin when you make a fist.<br/>
<br/>
I'm no longer so sure about the idea of tsuba surfaces being remelted.  It's mentioned in various sources and seems like a plausible process.  It looks a lot like the melted glaze on a piece of ceramic.  But when I talk about this with smiths they do not believe that it is possible.  They say that the surface would be burned rather than melted.  I have followed up with questions about fluxes and atmospheres that might make it possible, but haven't gotten anywhere.  However, I also haven't gotten anywhere when I ask how they think that those "melted" surfaces were really produced.  I'm still looking for answers on this one.<br/>
<br/>
There are other groups that made these "melted" yakite finishes.  <br/>
<br/>
Also, there are a number of other explanations for the formation of tekkotsu including inhomogeneities in carbon content and subsequent wear and rusting.  I think that there is some truth in all of them.  I had a chance to glance at the link that Rich provided and I think that it is good stuff.  Busy day today, so a quick answer.<br/>
<br/>
Jim<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  Hi Jim, on the website you write: ' These tsuba appear to have been<br/>
  finished by slightly melting the surface after forging and shaping. This<br/>
  brings out tekkotsu from the high carbon inclusions in the iron'<br/>
<br/>
  Was this done at any other schools or is this peculiar to Kanayama? <br/>
<br/>
  Als if you had to translate 'tekkotsu' in English what would it be? I<br/>
  know what it is (at least I think I do) but I can't for the life of me<br/>
  think what you would call it in English. <br/>

Mostly in excellent condition, no wear or soil to the tsuka ito, <br/>

<br/>
1. The saya is dinged up.  Not terribly badly, but far from <br/>

the "black" lacquer is seen to be black with translucent brown <br/>

2. The kashira is for correct court wear, i.e., it is black horn, not <br/>
a kinko match for the fuchi (which is signed, though the apparently <br/>

<br/>
3.  Though the tsuba has the hitsu, there are no accessories, and no <br/>
provisions for any in the saya.<br/>

Just saw your question.  As described it sounds like it's a koshirae <br/>
that should pass shinsa.  The point to submitting it would be do get <br/>

Whether that is worth doing is up to you.  There should be an NTHK <br/>

I am new on this site and am also the recipient of about a dozen tsuba. I was told that they are dated somewhere around the third century?

<br/>
This list is probably the right place to go if you want to find out if <br/>
what you've got is "probably" authentic, and<br/>
get some idea as to date, style, etc., if legitimate, and is a great <br/>
place to start if you actually wish to<br/>
learn more about tsuba, fittings, etc.,.<br/>
<br/>
That being said, the easiest first step would be to take some pictures <br/>
or scans of the tsuba, put them up on your website<br/>
(or just get a yahoo photos account - they're free, and you can store 30 <br/>
meg of pictures there), and post pointers to the<br/>
pictures on this list - there are actually a number of knowledgable <br/>
individuals on this list, and you'll usually get at least<br/>
some comments about them...<br/>
<br/>
Good Luck,<br/>
