<h3>Mito vs Mito shoami ( ?)</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1266596753">Jim, Alan, Rich et al.<br/>
<br/>
My remarks may be radical and heretical considering<br/>
how casually the term "Mito Shoami" is bandied about<br/>
on this list and others.<br/>
<br/>
I have never seen a tsuba or other kodogu attributed<br/>
to Mito Shoami. I am of the opinion that Shoami<br/>
artisans were not productive there.<br/>
<br/>
There are certainly pieces that have papered to just Mito.<br/>
But none that I know of to Mito Shoami,<br/>
in which case the basic premise is incorrect.<br/>
<br/>
Jim,<br/>
The book you are referring to I presume is titled:<br/>
Tetsu no Isho - Mito-To to Tosogu no Meihin (1996).<br/>
Ibaraki Prefectural Historical Museum.<br/>
<br/>
In section II - Mito Kinko no Tosogu,<br/>
The introductory text records prominent individuals<br/>
and groups that were active in Mito (Hitachi province).<br/>
Among them:<br/>
Gunji Yogoro<br/>
Yatabe Tsuji<br/>
Seiryuken Ha<br/>
Ichiryu (Hitotsuyanagi) Ha<br/>
Tamagawa Ha<br/>
Uchikoshi Ha<br/>
Yasuchika Ha (from the 4th gen. Yasuchika)<br/>
Saotome and Myochin.<br/>
And of course, Hagiya Shohei (Katsuhira) and Unno Shomin.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
NO mention of Shoami in Mito.<br/>
<br/>
Checking Haynes- Tsuba, An Aesthetic Study.<br/>
Under the section dealing with SHOAMI he mentions:<br/>
Kyo Shoami, Awa Shoami, Bizen Shoami, Iyo Shoami,<br/>
Aizu Shoami, Shonai Shoami, Akita Shoami,<br/>
Bushu (Edo) Shoami & Sakushu (Mimasaka) Shoami.<br/>
In addition he adds individuals who signed:<br/>
Oshu Shoami, Soshu (Odawara) Shoami, Seishu (Ise) Shoami,<br/>
Osaka (Settsu) Shoami, Banshu (Harima) Shoami,<br/>
Inshu (Inaba) Shoami & Kurume (Chikugo) Shoami.<br/>
<br/>
Again NO mention of Mito Shoami.<br/>
<br/>
I have never liked the term Mito Shoami<br/>
and have never used it. This thread presented<br/>
an opportunity to research the issue<br/>
to see if my opinion had any basis.<br/>
<br/>
Can anyone document a piece that has been<br/>
authoritatively classified as Mito Shoami<br/>
or have we been perpetuating a fallacy?<br/>
