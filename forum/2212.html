<h3>Primped/doctored tsuba</h3>
by <i>steven_88_2000</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-247893423">Greetings all,<br/>
<br/>
I was wondering if any of you might have some good photos of <br/>
tsuba that illustrate in detail evidence of primping.  As a newbie <br/>
in tsuba study and collecting, it would be SO helpful to actually <br/>
SEE pictures of such primping (wax, lacquer, etc...), as well as to <br/>
see some before and after pictures of tsuba with rust issues <br/>
and then "post- rust issues"...  If a folder could be opened in the <br/>
"photos" section of the group here, I think it would be really <br/>
beneficial, especially to rookies like me!  Just a thought...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1971429597">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
I would think that papered pieces would not be very<br/>
primped.  Wouldn't the judges be fairly good at<br/>
detection and the piece's score would be negatively<br/>
impacted by such a discovery?  One for Jim G. to<br/>
answer?<br/>
<br/>
Getting ivory is simple, look on ebay.  I found lots<br/>
of piano keys listed if I remember correctly, although<br/>
I purchased a lot of broken ivory pieces.  The netsuke<br/>
that came in the lot had a great red inplanted<br/>
signature, too bad the head was cut off.  I traded it<br/>
for some repro menuki, that are nice quality but I<br/>
don't know what to do with them at the moment.  I<br/>
figured better than a netsuke with no head.<br/>
<br/>
Jim G's input on what is acceptable for papers would<br/>
be interesting.  <br/>

Yes, this is a great site... :o).  I have spent quite a bit of time here, <br/>
and it's a wealth of information, no doubt.  I think what I'm looking <br/>
for, though, is to actually see some good close-up photos of a <br/>
waxed, lacquered, or otherwise primped tsuba.  Sometimes it's <br/>
easier to understand when a piece is doctored via visuals than  <br/>
by desciption only...  Thanks much for the response, Bob.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1737254554">Hi Curran - <br/>
<br/>
It is probably wise to become familiar with some of the "enhancements" techniques used on iron tsuba, simply to recognize them when you come across them. More important though, would be to jump at any opportunity to actually "see" first-hand, truly first class iron tsuba and to let your mind absorb (even subconsciously) what you are seeing. The Higo display and Jim Gilbert's sukashi display (which I missed) in Chicago was super! These days, each show has similar displays for us to enjoy. I believe Bill Miller did one on Satsuma tsuba last Tampa show. Check out those "high dollar" tsuba on dealers' tables. San Francisco had a fair number of Juyo tsuba (and other kodogu) out for sale. Evenually, exposing yourself to this real "art" quality--what's really fine art--will (hopefully) develop into a better appreciation of iron tsuba, and you will find yourself passing over the hundreds of average works and homing in on that one tsuba that has that "something extra" which your mind is drawing you to. Buy that one! <br/>
<br/>
Long winded yes, but you see what I'm getting at. Personally, I continue to admire lots of different tsuba but when that special one comes along, hopefully, I'll grab it.<br/>

You should see a tsuba with all the holes plugged.<br/>
One was missing when I got it ..........see if you can spot the " <br/>
replacement "  , time yourself. It's fun.<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
A clumsy repatination, resurfacing of the piece, major rusting, paint, shoe polish, etc., will result in a failure.  <br/>
<br/>
OTOH, a perfectly done restoration that is exactly right for the original piece will be no problem.  <br/>
<br/>
The in between stuff will have a point consequence.  Condition counts.<br/>
<br/>
Cleaning off rust is of course OK as long as the surface isn't damaged, but pits will remain and they will count against condition.<br/>
<br/>
A piece that has been cleaned to the point that it looks younger than it should can be a problem.  This is where cleaning out the sukashi openings can hurt you even if you personally like the way that looks.  If the age cues are contradictory, the judgment tends to go to the younger date.  The object of conservation or even restoration is not to make the guard look new.<br/>
<br/>
Clear wax isn't going to help a bad surface at shinsa, but it shouldn't hurt a good one either.  If an owner really likes his pieces waxy or lives on the ocean it shouldn't be a big problem, since the wax can be seen through and is not a permanent coating.  I suppose that someone could come up with a way to over do it to the point where the guard looks so strange that the real origin comes into question.  <br/>
<br/>
Polishing guards to the point where the surface becomes shiny and looses surface character is a problem.  Burnishing obscures the traits of the iron necessary for kantei.  It's really a slower process to get to the same place as resurfacing and/or poor repatination.<br/>
<br/>
Like Ron said, look at all of the great pieces you can get your eyes on and remember them.<br/>

what if there are active red rust in the opening ? leave it alone to <br/>
continue doing structural damage ?  Some of the early sukashi guards <br/>
have very " thin " opening and I have seen some iron  can literally <br/>
fell off with the slightest touch............<br/>

If it is actively corroding you should stop it.  There is no sense in allowing a piece to degrade in your care.  If the sukashi is extremely fragile, maybe a drop of camellia oil would be the right approach.  It will darken the rust (a lot), but obviously that is not as bad as damaging the iron.  If a tool is required to scrape, I'd pick a very thin, flexible one that would bend with less force that it'd take to damage the sukashi.<br/>
<br/>
Any other ideas on stabilizing corrosion in a sensitive area like this?<br/>
