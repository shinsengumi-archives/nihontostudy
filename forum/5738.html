aware that was the case. Can you elaborate, Alan? Or how would one tell a<br/>

shinsa panels'?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-557384537">Alan, you're not saying that all Tokubetsu Kicho papers are unacceptable, are you? My impression is that the NBTHK simply tightened the reins on what gets what paper. Like something mumei that was given the lowest level "white" paper would never be papered, today (because of a lack of quality). I'm not sure where the next level (Tokubetsu Kicho) fits today but Koshu Tokubetsu Kicho would be like today's Hozon level and some earlier Juyo Token might only get Tokubetsu Hozon, today. Something like that. <br/>

<h3>Re: [nihontostudy] Re: Papers</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-773607121">Hi all, I think what Alan is alluding to is that there is fair <br/>
evidence that at some time in I think the 70's or 80's, at one of the <br/>
outer Tokyo branches, there was quite a bit of influence being exerted <br/>
by some unsavoury criminal elements on some of the judges, to get their <br/>
swords through, and this resulted in green papers being issued on swords <br/>
they shouldn't. That at least is how I understand it.<br/>
<br/>
It was also only after a certain time, like in the last 10 years that <br/>
they were in existence, or something like that.<br/>
<br/>
I have always been of the opinion that if it has a green paper, re <br/>
submit it for a Hozon. Don't forget that new evidence on a smith or <br/>
school could have since come to light and or new thinking may be in <br/>
place and you may get a different result regardless if the paper is good <br/>
or bad.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers<br/>
<br/>
