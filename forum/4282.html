The above link is to an interesting site in Japan of the Nihontou <br/>
Tosougou Kenkyukai.  You can patch the page into the altavista link <br/>
for a 'translation' although we all know how Japanese to English <br/>
translates by now.  On the left side of the page there are a series <br/>
of lectures which have many examples to see, both sword and <br/>
fittings.  Lecture three has several Ezo examples.<br/>
<br/>
OK Alan, here is a further quote from Buttweiler;<br/>
<br/>
     'The surface of Ezo Menuki were originally covered by a thick <br/>
layer of Gold applied as an amalgam.  The Gold was burnished with a <br/>
rather large needle which left well defined polishing marks.  The <br/>
Gold used for the overlay was of very low karat.  The resulting color <br/>
is a very pale Silver-Golden hue.  The Gold will frequently be worn <br/>
from the high spots leaving a black Shakudo-like patina'.<br/>
<br/>
I have a feeling that much of what we see tody are the remnants of <br/>
field worn gear.  This might explain the relatively poor condition of <br/>
many of these very early fittings.  Fine pieces for the commanders or <br/>
Daimyo were passed on as family treasures or left to shrines.  The <br/>
vast majority of the rest were simply lost to battle or to time.</div>
