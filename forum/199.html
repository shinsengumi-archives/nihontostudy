<h3>Fw: Haynes article</h3>
by <i>sworddad</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-405559258">Hi all -<br/>
<br/>
With the arrival of the latest NCJSC newsletter, To-Ron, the first thing that caught my eye was an article written by Bob Haynes titled "The Conscience of the Collector." At first I was not sure where Bob was going with his article but reading it, I found it quite "thought provoking and wondered if others also found it so.<br/>
<br/>
Basically, if I understand it correctly, the article points up the need for more serious kodogu study outside of Japan and the importance of thinking "outside the box"--traditional "Japanese thinking"--when it comes to sword study. <br/>
<br/>
I found it interesting to read Bob's comments regarding the intended goal of the JSS/US when it was formed back in the late '50s and also how today's world of collecting outside of Japan takes on primarily a "buy and sell" atmospher, that nobody puts on an exhibit purely for study as was done a few times in the past.  <br/>
<br/>
Not going anywhere with this other than to say I found the article very interesting and though provoking.  Food for thought?  Just wondered in anyone else found it so.<br/>

Well, I'd certainly like to see more major US displays, lectures, etc., but I don't think that the situation is quite so bleak.<br/>
<br/>
There have been other significant museum shows (Copper Union, Japan Society, Phoenix Art Museum, etc.), lecturers from Japan, and many smaller displays put on in NY, LA and SF that are not associated with sword shows.  And of course the sword shows themselves have not-for-sale displays of swords and fittings and the occasional lecture.<br/>
<br/>
I found the comments about Japanese experts and foreign students in the first half of the article more provocative.  Again, I have a more positive outlook, but I'd like to hear some comments from the guys with long term experience in Japan.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1116215200">Thanks Jim,<br/>
<br/>
I got the newsletter yesterday. I don't know if it was me or what, but I<br/>
found the first several paragraphs almost incomprehensible. I also noted the<br/>
lack of mention of the Hawaii Taikai put on by the NTHK back in the early<br/>
80s, which included a one month show at the Honolulu Academy of Arts, a one<br/>
day display by craftsment and a lecture by Yoshikawa Kentaro sensei<br/>
(brilliantly translated by me, I might add). I found myself agreeing to some<br/>
of the points raised, but thinking there was a lot of over generalizing,<br/>
particularly in terms of disagreeing with "sensei." It depends on the<br/>
sensei. There is also something called politeness. Telling a man in his 80s<br/>
that he is full of it is probably not the best way to develop relationships.<br/>
As for Western scolarly works on Japanese swords, I think we can see this<br/>
attitude everywhere, not just from the Japanese. What would you say to<br/>
someone who told you that so and so was a famed Japanese professor of<br/>
Shakespeare? You are not only English, but an English professor yourself.<br/>
You have never heard of so-and-so. You also find out that so-and-so can't<br/>
speak English and has never published anything on Shakespeare in the English<br/>
language. I think you might have trouble accepting the statement that<br/>
so-and-so is a famed professor of Shakespeare. Since most Western "scolars"<br/>
of the Japanese sword do not publish in Japanese and may not even be able to<br/>
read the language let alone speak it, I have little problem agreeing that<br/>
their work might not be up to snuff. Bob, on the other hand, is recognized<br/>
here as being "mekiki" (good eyed) and "erai" (brilliant). Hagihara sensei<br/>
was blown away by his book. I have been writing a series in Japanese on the<br/>
Kanabo school, which has also been well recieved here. I don't want to be<br/>
hard on Bob, but I thought there was some self-serving stuff in there, as<br/>
well as a bit of hypocricy, "you're a bunch of dealers, but I ran an auction<br/>
that was educational." Hmmm.<br/>
