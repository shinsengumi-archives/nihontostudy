<h3>Cleaning and repairing shakudo</h3>
by <i>sworddad</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-153851351">Hi all - <br/>
<br/>
A recently acquired kozuka/kogai which seems to have good potential to something mainline Goto--depicting "snow covered mandarin orange tree"--has some damage to it.  Specifically, the "blade" of the kogai has several not "nicks" to its edge which are sad to see but I would guess, repairable.  Have any of you had repairs done on shakudo kodogu like this before?  <br/>
<br/>
The kozuka has a couple spots of patina damage (fingerprinting?) on its backside which would seem, could be gently fixed; the patina blended in, let's say.  Here my question refers to the nanako.  It has what I first considered to be simply "wear" to the nanako.  Looking closer, I suspect the nanako has become smooth in places not from wear, but from clogging caused by oily dirt.  I'm curious if any of you have found a "safe" way to remove this oily dirt buildup.  <br/>

I had this same problem on a Kozuka. Seems that with<br/>
age gunk gets in all the textures of them. I'm not<br/>
sure that I won't get flamed for this but I found that<br/>
a wooden toothpick to pick out the big stuff and then<br/>
a very soft-headed toothbrush and some water helps to<br/>
break up and get rid of the rest of it. I'm not sure<br/>
if this is a good or sanctioned way to do it but it<br/>
worked for me.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-401586705">Hi all,,,,,,,,,,,for Ron H. and Bob R,,,,,,,,,,,I bought a Goto tanto tsuba with the finest [smallest] nanako granules I've ever seen,,,,,,,,,,and the definition [or resolution] between the granules was very 'smeared',,,,,,,,,,but after inspection under a 10X glass, I saw that a grime of 400 to 500 years was my problem,,,,,,,,,,,,,I did a light scrubbing using diluted dish detergent and a very soft tooth brush and the definition of the nanako granules came back like magic,,,,,,,,,,,,after washing with water and carefully drying with soft cotton cloth, I coated with choji oil,,,,,,,,,,results of this cleaning were quite acceptable.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1902983368">One caution is that cleaning out the nanako on Ko-Goto, Ko-Kinko, etc., is somewhat like cleaning the inner walls of iron sukashi tsuba or the backsides of menuki.  Old fittings are old, and cleaning them to the point of making them look new again is not the best thing to do.  Not to say that dirt and grime are the goal, but exercise restraint in cleaning early pieces.<br/>
