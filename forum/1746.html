<h3>extreme macro on the cheep...</h3>
by <i>rkgatteleport</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1521241044">Hey guys,<br/>
<br/>
I don't know if anybody cares, but I just tried a trick that a lot of <br/>
the P&S digital guys<br/>
are doing  - they reverse a lens in front of the lens on their camera - <br/>
this appears to work<br/>
real well on these due to their smaller lens geometry/built in zoom. <br/>
 However,  I wanted to<br/>
see if this would work on a DSLR. So I scrounged up an old nikon 50mm lens<br/>
(you can get these dirt cheep) and tried that reversed on my 50mm lens. <br/>
 the result<br/>
was this:<br/>

<br/>
This suuucks - you can see the vignetting/blockage  around the edges :-(<br/>
<br/>
Before just putting the piece up on ebay, I decided to try it reversed <br/>
on a 105mm macro.<br/>
(and here's the obligatory nihonto related content) - this is a picture <br/>
of an iris on a kashira<br/>
that I have - note that I didn't take much time in the setup (used a <br/>
lamp for lighting and<br/>
wagged the white balance) and the camera is at a complex and incorrect <br/>
angle<br/>
relative to the surface (so not a lot of its in focus), but...<br/>

<br/>
You can see it just starting to vignette in the very corners, but a <br/>
little crop, and...<br/>
<br/>
Not as flexible as a mp-e 65, but it doesn't cost $800 either....<br/>
<br/>
Just had to share...<br/>

<h3>The joy of tosho tsuba</h3>
by <i>Peter A Bleed</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1744633732">Dear Friends,<br/>
      Let me share a share a minor but satisfying bit of collecting and<br/>
what might be a worthwhile tip for tsuba preservation.<br/>
      Saturday morning I "picked up" a sorry little tosho tsuba. It was<br/>
thin -  3 mm - and rather small, but showed a wonderful delamination flaw<br/>
and a very sabishii set of 4 'arrow fletch' cut-outs. It clearly is an old<br/>
soldier that I'll bet you dates from the later Muromachi period. I rather<br/>
like these things, but this one was in  "as found condition" which meant it<br/>
was terribly dirty and seemingly covered with red rust and some kind of<br/>
really noxious pucky. At first I thought that I should just throw it in the<br/>
junk box, but decided to give it a bit of 'treatment.'<br/>
      After a good boiling, it was clean enough to show the laminations,<br/>
but it was also entirely bright. In that condition It wouldn't look good<br/>
even in the junk box, so I invited it to have a bit of color. It responded<br/>
nicely, but it was now rather fresh. Here's the tip I discovered. I used a<br/>
bit of boar tusk to "bone" the surface. I used this in the usual way, to<br/>
burnish the flat surfaces and clean out the sukashi and the rim. I was VERY<br/>
impresses that the tusk seemed to work better than the antler does. It was<br/>
not hard enough to scratch the surface so that it left no bright  lines. It<br/>
also was hard enough to leave not dusty residue on the surface. But it did<br/>
a nice job of finishing the surface and quickly turned it a nice dark<br/>
blue/black. With a dab of oil, and in less than an hour, this tsuba went<br/>
from a questionable buy to a presentable piece I was pleased to hang with<br/>
my other swordsmith guards.<br/>
      I could never have done this sort of thing with a finer or more<br/>
valuable tsuba, but in this case I felt I not getting beyond my<br/>
capabilities and also that I was preserving an old guard that was 'at<br/>
risk.' From now one, I am going to use the harder tusk rather than antler.<br/>
Ahhh the joys of collecting<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-983582828">Hi Peter and Ron;<br/>
<br/>
The method of heating the tsuba in a solution of some sort, water being the most common is an old and accepted method of cleaning IRON tsuba.  This normally does not change the color but removes the grease and grime that collects on tsuba over time.  <br/>
<br/>
I personally prefer to use a soft soap and a toothbrush with warm/hot water to clean the plate.<br/>
<br/>
Unless you over cook it and give the plate a dry look and feel, either is quite an acceptable treatment and cleaning method for iron tsuba.<br/>
<br/>
The "home grown family secrets" of various compounds and tea solutions is a deferent kettle of fish however.  Most tsuba collectors have their own methods for this treatment.<br/>
<br/>
Cleaning the active red rust by "boning" the plate and then oiling and carrying in your pocket or rubbing with a soft cloth is also an old accepted method of rejuvenating and healing the iron plate that has been neglected to restore the patina to the plate, and repair the color of the plate.<br/>
<br/>
I have seen a number of over cleaned iron tsuba however.  Over cleaning can removed the patina and leave a "shiny" surface to the plate that takes a long time to repatinate unless chemical solutions are used to age the plate.  These chemically treated tsuba, that seem to go from a shoe polish black to a brown in color to my eyes never look as good as the original patina that develops with age and use.<br/>
<br/>
These methods are NOT to be tried on kinko or soft metal tsuba, it will destroy the finish of the soft metal plate.<br/>

The photo makes it look much worse than it is, but there seems to be two<br/>

No magic wand? A friend left a "jug of "elixor" with me during a move several months back, but he warned me that it was "toxic." One of the "old formulas" that can be found, I've never had a go at it for fear of poisoning myself or contaminating my house with toxic stuff! Maybe this summer, outdoors...  I've always felt that those ancient tsuba makers must had used something pretty simple and from nature. Reminds me years ago when our old mutual friend Clarence, had his cat spray some fittings he had laying around and turned some damaged shakudo a nice black! ;-) <br/>

You might try Big Mo.  He has had some very good success with restoring shibuichi and shakudo tsuba.<br/>

  I've got a nice copper or shibuichi tsuba (I think) with a completely<br/>
  screwed up patina:<br/>
<br/>
  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.nihonto.ca/hiroyuki/front-l.jpg">http://www.nihonto.ca/hiroyuki/front-l.jpg</a><br/>
<br/>
  Any words of wisdom on repairing this?<br/>
<br/>
  The photo makes it look much worse than it is, but there seems to be two<br/>
  different colors of patina on it, and one area where it is thinner and<br/>
  then a fingerprint has burned right through.<br/>
<br/>
  I really like this tsuba and it would be nice to be able to make it<br/>
  right again.<br/>
