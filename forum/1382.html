A quick look at "People, Places and Things in Henri Joly's Legend in<br/>
Japanese Art: An Analytical Index" (Tompkins & Tompkins, 1978) shows almost<br/>
a whole column of page references to various aspects of the tortoise theme<br/>
beyond that on p. 343. (A book I cannot imagine not having!)<br/>
<br/>
David, I think you can go any direction you like with the other fittings.<br/>
The cranes referred to below would be one obvious good choice, but there<br/>
could be many others that would be a good fit in the eyes of a Samurai of<br/>
several hundred years ago. Look at the books that document original koshirae<br/>
and you will find few examples of fittings that all match except for the<br/>
Goto and related schools that made up sets like that or produced fittings<br/>
for generations that followed established themes that could be put together<br/>
in "matched sets." It's our Western aesthetic that finds the matched sets<br/>
pleasing to the eye and too many collectors overlook and even have destroyed<br/>
the authentic original combinations in the obsession to have "matching"<br/>
fittings. Only my opinion of course!<br/>
<br/>
Fabulous tsuba, David, thanks for sharing it.<br/>

593. Minogame ? p343<br/>
The tortoise (Kame) of a thousand years, one of the four supernatural <br/>
animals (Tiger, Dragon, Howo, Tortoise) of Chinese mythology (the Kirin <br/>
takes sometimes the place of the tiger). One of the tortoises presents <br/>
some of the features of the dragon, generally the head, but the most <br/>
common presentment of the sacred animal has a long tail, said to grow <br/>
when it is over five hundred years old, and the origin of which is <br/>
probably due to the fact that tortoises kept in ponds become covered <br/>
with a parasitic growth of vegetable origin the resemblance of which to <br/>
the Mino, or rain coat of peasants, was too irresistible a chance of <br/>
punning to be left unnoticed. The hairy tortoise is often shown carrying <br/>
on its back a huge rock, with the three or more jewels or even Mount <br/>
Horai itself, perhaps as a modification of the Chinese custom to show <br/>
the tortoise as a pedestal for inscribed tablets, in itself a likely <br/>
treatment of the Hindoo legend which places the world on the back of an <br/>
elephant, standing on a gigantic tortoise. The feet of the tortoise <br/>
were, according to the Chinese, used to consolidate the world by the <br/>
Empress Jokwa (q.v.) after Kung Kung had shattered the pillar of Heaven. <br/>
The tortoise is emblematic of longevity, and as such found as one of the <br/>
constant attributes of Fukurokujin, Jurojin, and the various legendary <br/>
patriarchs, Sennins, or other personages who were endowed with <br/>
particularly long spans of earthly existence, See Emblems, Koan, <br/>
Urashima, Monkey.<br/>
A blind minogame, with an eye instead of navel x x x x , dwells at the <br/>
bottom of the sea. It can never see the sun but every three thousand <br/>
years, when it rises to the surface, and even then it must find on the <br/>
waves a plank with a hole in it, place its eye over the hole and await <br/>
some friendly gust of wind to turn upside down both tortoise and board. <br/>
This Buddhist parable from the Hoke Ryo has passed into a proverb <br/>
applied to unlikely events. The story is given in Ehon Hokan, IV., 23, <br/>
in which are also found the story of the monkey and the tortoise, and of <br/>
the tortoise and the two cranes. A minogame whose pond was drying up <br/>
fast, begged two cranes to take her to some other lake, and they tried <br/>
to do so by means of a reed, which both cranes held in their bills, and <br/>
to which the tortoise hung by her jaws; but the minogame wished to speak <br/>
whilst in mid air, and it dropped to the ground where it died, (H., 22). <br/>
See Umi Bozu.<br/>
The terrapin is another tortoise which has its place among proverbs. <br/>
Tsuki ni Suppon means: The moon is not the only round thing, and is <br/>
often illustrated. One sees sometimes a drawing of one or two tortoises <br/>
dangling from a string above the parapet of a bridge, this represents <br/>
the small tortoises sold by pedlars, and which people buy to liberate in <br/>
ponds. This custom is called Hojoye, or sitting free: and the <br/>
tortoise-sellers adopt as a mark the characters x x Hanashi Kame: <br/>
tortoises to be let loose.<br/>
