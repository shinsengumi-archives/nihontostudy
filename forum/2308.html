<h3>&quot; e-bay &quot;missing sword  resolved</h3>

happy to report the sword is found and located. It is with the <br/>
prankster  and he promised not to dip the sword in acid to enhance <br/>
the hamon nor wack  the " bushies " ( ops, sorry about that ).<br/>
The prank was meant as a " lesson " to me for  " thinking " that  <br/>
there's a possibility  a hard working cleaning person could <br/>
liberated  it from my hotel room ( a resonable possibility as I can't <br/>
recall exactly when/where the sword  was missed , if I can, then it <br/>
won't  go missing, yes ? ). The reason it went missing was I left it <br/>
in the shinsa room. Absent-mindedness, it comes with advancing age.<br/>
So,  My appology to all the lists for causing all the fuss.<br/>
<br/>
One thing I learned from this  " prank "......................<br/>
 The  show organisers are quick with members'  concern, when I <br/>
reported  the e-bay listing  very early in the morning ( through e-<br/>
mail ), I got an immediate response. They contacted the hotel <br/>
security immediately and initiated an investigation which I have to <br/>
later explain that it could be a possible prank.   Not funny.<br/>
<br/>
Lastly ,thank you all for the concerns, suggestions.  I am glad the <br/>
sword is not with some wackos who may actually use it to wack the <br/>
bushies  ( ops, sorry about that, again ).<br/>
