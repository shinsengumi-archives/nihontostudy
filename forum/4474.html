<h3>Studying &#39;newbee&#39;</h3>
by <i>elliottshogun</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-382689974">I was complaining about learning nothing from shinsa (NY 2006)other <br/>
than a falling off temperline in the tip is (maybe) a fatal flaw. <br/>
Since I am definitly a 'newbee' and I study, study, study, I found <br/>
something called YAKIOTOSHI. I also studyied the JUYO BIJUTSU HIN and <br/>
TOKUBETSU JUYO blades that have this wonderful feature. Yakiotoshi is <br/>
of no concern, infact an attribute to old, Koto swords. <br/>
<br/>
I am happier to find this out myself from studying than to have <br/>
nothing told to me after a shinsa. What they could have said, "This is <br/>
a Koto blade possibly made by Sukesada but we won't paper it due to <br/>
the temperline running off in the tip". Even without paper, thats <br/>
money well spent.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1686335549">Hi Elliot, no offence, but do not try to confuse your sword with a Juyo <br/>
or higher sword unless yours is of the same level. The hamon running off <br/>
the kissaki IS a fatal flaw, make no bones about that. Swords with fatal <br/>
flaws that make Tokubetsu Hozon, Juyo or Yashu saku are swords of <br/>
extraordinary worth, and a flaw that is fatal can not take away it's <br/>
history. These swords are typically famous because they are rare, or <br/>
were carried by someone important or famous. General swords, made by the <br/>
not so famous sword smiths, no matter how nice will most likely fail all <br/>
attempts at kanteisho if theirs is a fatal flaw like the hamon running <br/>
off the Ha or Kissaki, a Hagiri and the likes.<br/>
<br/>
We all learn hard lessons and we never like being told that our hard <br/>
earned and well spent money if for naught, but this is a mugs game, it <br/>
takes nerves of steel and a firm resolve. All I can suggest is to get <br/>
over it and move on. I mean that in the nicest possible way. I am not <br/>
trying to be smart, just realistic.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck<br/>

<h3>Re: Studying &#39;newbee&#39;</h3>
by <i>elliottshogun</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1324791667">Thank you Richard,<br/>
<br/>
I am not upset or mad at anybody. After careful study and input from <br/>
yourself, Moses, and others, I realized that I purchased this sword <br/>
as a piece to study. It has served it's purpose and I personally <br/>
love this sword. It is in excellant polish, the Koshirae is better <br/>
than average and I will put it up on my web site as soon as I am <br/>
able to take good pictures of it. My write up will include something <br/>
about the missing Boshi. During the Sengoku Wars, if a tip was <br/>
broken off for whatever reason, repair the tip (make a new Kissaki)<br/>
and send the Samurai back to fight another day.<br/>
<br/>
All is well............Thanks again,<br/>
<br/>
