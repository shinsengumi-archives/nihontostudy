<h3>Interesting Tsuba</h3>
by <i>retalt</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1030326958">Greetings all. Today I was watching an NBTHK novice course video and it has in the tsuba section, an interesting piece that had as its mimi, a ring that is perhaps 3 or 4 mm wide and it could be rotated. to try and explain this better, the, mimi would be like a tyre on a car wheel, the wheel doesn't turn but the tyre does, does this make sense ?????, maybe I should draw a picture LOL. <br/>
<br/>
What would be the purpose of this if any ?. purely aesthetics ?, or would it have some hidden function ?<br/>

I haven't seen the video, are you describing a fukurin (rim cover)?  One characteristic of Hirata Hikozo's fukurin is that they turn freely on the guard.  His are original to the plate and were put there for aesthetic reasons.  Most fukurin do not turn freely like that.  Sometimes fukurin were added when the mimi was damaged and/or the plate was reduced in diameter.  I suppose that's also for aesthetics.  <br/>
<br/>
The only functional reasons for a fukurin that I can think of would be to keep a rough rim from catching on clothing or to protect the tsuba from wear (if you were really fussy about preserving your tsuba).  Of course for multi-layer construction a fukurin is sometimes used to mechanically hold the plates together and to cover what would otherwise be a pretty unattractive rim.  <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes you find plates that have had a fukurin removed, but you can still see a ring left on the surface where it was applied.  One method of attaching a fukurin involved cutting a small rectangular notch in the mimi (usually at the "6 o'clock" position), and sometimes you'll see this on a piece that has lost the rim cover.<br/>

I have one tsuba with  the notch at 6 O'clock just as you described.<br/>
The mimi was finished quite smooth and nice though. So the missing fukurin <br/>
most likely was placed there  for esthetic reason then.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1638499549">Hi Jim, sorry for the delay in reply, I've been a bit ill and had to <br/>
have a few days in bed. Yes, I guess it would be a fukurin. It was quite <br/>
wide, not unlike the wide rim of a sukashi tsuba,  dont think ( only <br/>
guessing ) this would have been added later on as it seemed too well <br/>
designed and fitted, it looked to much, part of the tsuba. If I can <br/>
remember, I will scan a frame of the vid next week at work and post a <br/>
pic so we can see.<br/>
<br/>
thanks for the info<br/>
<br/>
cheers<br/>
