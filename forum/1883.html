<br/>
G'day Rich - <br/>
<br/>
My opinions are based largely on "gut feeling" when seeing the guard since, on photographs at least, these groups do resemble each other. Having the tsuba in-hand would of course make for a stronger argument for (or against) the groups mentioned, I would think. <br/>
<br/>
Maybe I shouldn't had called the edge treatment "bones" but it would be the lines visiable from the three-fold construction of Akasaka. Last year I purchased a wonderful "willow tree" iron sukashi tsuba, mumei--one of my "dream" tsuba ever since Sasano illustrated this motif in his sukashi tsuba book. I felt it was Akasaka and it did have these linear lines (bones?) in its edge. Jim Gilbert and Henrik Eschbaum...<br/>
<br/>
(Was checking a spelling and accidently "sent" this...hope I got the right name here!)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, they did agree to Akasaka and pointed out this layering which was quite evident on this tsuba. Of course, I was thrilled. In this case the guard could had been Kyo-sukashi or even Higo. It brought some nice discussion.<br/>
<br/>
As for Tosa Myochin, I have not had a lot of experience with their work but do think the plate might not be a "good" compared to Akasaka. They also often used the "mustache" type chiseling around the nakago-ana. Your tsuba does not show this (nor does one I have that is signed Tosa Myochin). When I see the surface decoration as is in your tsuba, I must admit it shoots me to Nishigaki group. Interesting to compare this treatment of the various Higo groups illustrated in Sasano's books. <br/>
<br/>
Exciting tsuba, all!!  Again, sorry for the incomplete earlier email. <br/>

  Hey Ron, thanks for that, I can see the layers on the inside of the<br/>
  nakago ana, but I am not seeing any bones in the mimi. I had not<br/>
  considered either Higo or Nishigaki, why points yo uin that direction<br/>
  ?. My thoughts towards Tosa My√¥chin are based on the the iron plate.<br/>
  It is almost identical to this guard in the way the plate has been forged.<br/>

  Akasaka I would expect to see some linear "bones" in the edge of the<br/>

  dare I say Higo, Nishigaki work perhaps? Whatever, it is nice. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-653915620">Hi Ron, yes, I must admit my own stupidity and negelected to consult my <br/>
books closely enough. I came across the work of the 2nd hereditary <br/>
master Nishigaki Kanshiro in 3 books last night and think that it may <br/>
also be possible that this is the work of a student of his. The <br/>
simularies are numoerous, except the quality of the work with Kanshiro's <br/>
work much finder in detail and plate. These of course could be just <br/>
copied by another artist from another school but I am tneding to agree <br/>
with the Nishigaki idea myself as well.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the conversation and thought's.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1261301283">Interesting, Rich. I would had thought the layering would be more subtle, but you sure can't miss these. Wish Jim Gilbert would see this and comment on it. Wonder if he is away? I've no knowledge of judging this but wonder if it is too loose for Akasaka work, thinking Akasaka would be much finer forging. Again, I'm just thinking out loud and really can not say. Will be interesting to hear from somebody more familiar with this kind of detail. Great macro-photo, Rich.<br/>
