 </span></blockquote>I don't believe that there was any accusation directed towards the study <br/>
group or it's members in this thread.  It seems a perfectly logical <br/>
conclusion that as knowledge of the intrinsic value of items is spread, <br/>
more interest will be directed towards those items from people of shady <br/>
character.  This does not reflect upon the group disseminating the <br/>
knowledge, it's simply the darker side of human nature.  It also does <br/>
not mean that one of the group is responsible (I could insert the pebble <br/>
thrown into the calm pond metaphor here... ).<br/>
<br/>
I hope that the blade is recovered and that these incidents don't become <br/>
commonplace.  I also hope that the discussion group meets with much success.<br/>

As a member of this new study group, I take exception to your statement that<br/>
this group may be responsible in any way for an increase in sword related<br/>
crimes. Clearly you have major issues with the courier you are using and the<br/>
police should be involved immediately upon any suspicious activity, but<br/>
please do not besmirch the efforts of the Japanese Canadian Cultural Centre<br/>
as it attempts to educate people on the samurai sword. Senior members of the<br/>
JSS/US are active participants in this group and I am sure they are not<br/>
going to be a party to any activity that does not promote a complete respect<br/>
for the sword and its history. Sorry to vent, but this was not an<br/>
appropriate conclusion on your part.<br/>

  A Tokubetsu Juyo Yukimitsu was stolen in transit from me to Japan. <br/>
<br/>
  Last year a Juyo Token Niji Kunitoshi was taken in the same manner, it<br/>
  was scanned by someone as being sent to Canada Customs, then it<br/>
  vanished. There was a several week period in both cases of me having to<br/>
  fight people who's computer screens told them something that wasn't<br/>
  true, then finally they admitted the package vanished into thin air.<br/>
<br/>
  Last year they searched the warehouse several times without it turning<br/>
  up, and when I said I was sending the police over, 15 minutes later the<br/>
  sword appeared in some office where someone had "mistakenly left it"<br/>
  after scanning that it was sent to customs.<br/>
<br/>
  My hope is that the same scam is being played again.<br/>
<br/>
  Obviously with the cost of a blade like this, it is not a trivial matter<br/>
  and I feel kind of sick. Insurance says they will not cover it. <br/>
<br/>
  Pictures of the blade are on my site as I have the paperwork.<br/>
<br/>
  It has gone missing or been stolen in the Toronto area. Lately there<br/>
  has been a new study group formed in Toronto with a lot of attendees. It<br/>

  Doug, <br/>
<br/>
  Those senior members of the group are my friends.<br/>
<br/>
  If you've read what I wrote as blaming the group, you got it completely<br/>
  wrong, and that would be an inappropriate conclusion on your own part.<br/>
<br/>
  Please don't turn this into a pissy flame war because honestly this is<br/>
  not a good situation and I'm just asking people to be on the lookout. <br/>
<br/>
  For what I'm saying, it's just that as information percolates and<br/>
  disseminates from meeting attendees to friends, to possibly sketchy<br/>
  friends, it is not clear what the long term effects are so that those of<br/>
  us who are used to sword value being completely under the radar have to<br/>
  start being a bit more alert.<br/>
<br/>
  Six degrees of separation are between every person in North America.<br/>
<br/>
  This means that chances are extremely good that some friend of a friend<br/>
  of a friend is a thief.<br/>
