<div id="ygrps-yiv-1081469156">One last reminder regarding the availability of the 2006 Kokusai Tosogu Kai Tokyo exhibition catalogue. <br/>
<br/>
I'm trying to avoid running to the post office any more than necessary, considering the wait encountered this time of year. Please note, it is $65 priority shipped FOR U.S.A. ADDRESS. Paypal works fine. (Shipping to Canada, etc., costs more to do from here. Other local KTK members can fill those requests.) <br/>
<br/>
Hopefully those who have gotten their copy are pleased with them. Nice Christmas or holiday gift idea at a very reasonable price! Order privately off list please: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:swords@...">swords@...</a> <br/>
<br/>
Thanks! <br/>

Hi all - <br/>
<br/>
A number of you ordered copies from me of the Kokusai Tosogu Kai's 2006 Exhibition catalogue of their recent Tokyo exhibition of sword fittings and koshirae. A new supply has come in and are now available. To simplify shipping, I decided to make these available to U.S. addresses at $65 post paid shipped priority mail. (Arrival probably in time for Christmas, in case any wives or sweeties are reading this.)<br/>
<br/>
Payment by Paypal to my account (Ron Hartmann <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:-swords@...">-swords@...</a>) is easy, or send me a check at: 5907 Deerwood Drive, St. Louis, MO 63123-2707. <br/>
<br/>
Anyone outside the U.S.A. can hopefully get them from a nearby KTK member. Those members on the List could make this known. (If must be, I can figure shipping outside the states but that's usually expensive and kind of a pain at the post office.)<br/>
<br/>
Here is a brief review of the catalogue by a Pete Klein (from a copy supplied by KTK member Richard Turner...<br/>

Any further question, email me privately and I'll try to answer them. When this group sells, I'll fade off into the sunset...<br/>
