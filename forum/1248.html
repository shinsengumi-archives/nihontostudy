<h3>Hayashi Shigemitsu</h3>
by <i>retalt</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1496738316">All, just received my december issue of To-Ron and there is an absolutely gorgeous sukashi guard by Hayashi Shigemitsu. I see noted it is only the 2nd knw guard outside of Japan by this artist. How rare is his work, how highly is he rated ??.<br/>

I only just got my issue.  The comment about it being the 2nd outside of Japan is a reference to the October issue where there was another example published with the claim of it being believed to be the only signed example outside of Japan.  How one would verify such a claim I don't know, but it's a bit hard to believe.  Certainly attributed work is more common than signed.  <br/>
<br/>
Shigemitsu is the second generation of the Hayashi line after Matashichi, the founder.  His work is well thought of, but is overshadowed by Matashichi, I think.  You'll find examples in the Higo sections of Sasano's sukashi tsuba books, in general tsuba books or of course in ones focusing on Higo.  Understanding the ins and outs of the Higo sukashi groups is challenging.<br/>

Believe it or not there was a Hayashi Shigemitsu in Sotheby's June sale, lot<br/>
180, it was even illustrated. It was missed by almost everybody including<br/>
myself, perhaps I should give up swords/tsuba and collect stamps, it even<br/>
had the Hayashi stamp on the reverse!.<br/>
