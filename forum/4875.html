I've just discovered this little gem about the history of Namban tetsu (foreign steel) in Japanese history and the involvement of the Dutch V.O.C. Company.  Namban tetsu was used in the making of swords and so recorded on the sword tang.<br/>

<br/>
I was very interested by the article that you posted on namban tetsu, <br/>
but am a little unhappy about the implied supposition that cannon from <br/>
the 'De Liefde' were the original source of this metal.<br/>
<br/>
I had believed that bronze - a mixture of 90% copper and 10% tin - was <br/>
the preferred metal used for the casting of cannon.  Although cast-iron <br/>
cannon became available ca 1550, these were much more difficult to <br/>
cast, and bronze remained the metal of choice until the mid to late <br/>
C17.  Since the 'De Liefde' arrived in Kyushu in 1600, is it not highly <br/>
likely that its cannon were of bronze rather than of iron?<br/>
<br/>
Is there an expert on cannon out there somewhere who can clarify this <br/>
point for me?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-655474173">Hi Dr. Lissenden, John, I believe you are right on about the cannon <br/>
being unlikely to be iron. Bronze cannon were so much easier to <br/>
produce and less likely to fail than iron. The only difference of <br/>
import at this time is bronze was more expensive to use. So, I went <br/>
to a forum where there are some dedicated historians. I paste the <br/>
answers below.<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, this might answer your question. The book 'The Dutch <br/>
Discovery Of Japan' by Dirk Jan Barreveld (which is full of errors, <br/>
but still helpful in gaining an understanding of Dutch trade) states <br/>
that a report filed by a Jesuit sent to inspect the ship says that <br/>
the ship had '19 pieces of guns made of bronze' (other sources give <br/>
the number as 18 or 26). <br/>
From Turnbull's Osaka book-Ieyasu had 10 European cannon at the <br/>
battles of Osaka in 1614-15. 5 were Dutch made 'Ishibaya' cannons <br/>
(which fired shot ranging from 12 lbs to 35-40 lbs-it's unclear which <br/>
type Ieyasu had, though). These were likely from the cannon taken <br/>
from DeLiefde. The other 5 were bought from the English East India <br/>
Company and were invoiced by Richard Cocks on December 5, 1614. They <br/>
included 4 culverins (17.5 lbs) and one saker (5.5 lbs). Out of about <br/>
300 artillery pieces Ieyasu fielded at Osaka, these were the only <br/>
heavy siege guns apart from one Japanese gun. This was <br/>
the 'Shinbatsuji' gun, which was made by Shibatsuji Ryuemon Sukenobu. <br/>
It was about 11 feet long with a 90 mm bore, and fired shot about the <br/>
same size as small Dutch cannon. Unfortunately, it's not noted what <br/>
they're made of-the picture of the Japanese gun (which is at <br/>
Yasukuni) looks like it was bronze. My Japanese books would likely <br/>
have this info, but they're not here .<br/>
<br/>
AND<br/>
<br/>
Samurai William, p.91, states that the Liefde's cannon were bronze<br/>
<br/>
I still await more information on possible early sources for <br/>
nambantetsu. I will let you know. It seems so far that article has a <br/>
lot of supposition. John<br/>

The swords with such inscriptions are by smiths working in large residential<br/>

I would think that the Dutch simply saw a lucrative market for iron ore and<br/>
began to import it through Dejima. We have all probably seen the photos of<br/>
the tear-shaped ingots that were imported for this use.<br/>

  Dear Excelsiorilluminati<br/>
<br/>
  Many thanks for the excellent research that you have done regarding <br/>
  the 'Die Liefke''s cannon, which seems to confirm our suspicions <br/>
  about these being of bronze. It is true, of course, that her <br/>
  cannonballs were almost certainly of cast iron; I believe that by <br/>
  the end of the C16 stone cannonballs had been virtually completely <br/>
  replaced by iron. It is thus possible that these might be considered <br/>
  as one possible source of namban iron.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-547877827">Hi, ThAround the 11th or 12th year of this same period of Keicho <br/>
(1606-1607), Yasutsugu's fame reached the point that he was called to <br/>
Edo (Tokyo) to share his time with Tokugawa Ieyasu. About this time <br/>
Yasutsugu was given the privilege of using the character "Yasu" from <br/>
Tokugawa Ieyasu's name. Thus he changed his name to Yasutsugu from <br/>
that point on. About the same time ( some feel it was a few years <br/>
later) he was given the additional privilege of carving the Hollyhock <br/>
crest ( Aoi mon) on his blades. These privileges were given in <br/>
perpetuity to Yasutsugu and his descendents. Thus the Yasutsugu <br/>
swordsmiths became the kaji of the Tokugawa Family.<br/>
<br/>
Earlier I raised the question of what made Yasutsugu's fame and <br/>
fortune seem to spread disproportionately to his skill when we <br/>
compare him to some of his contemporary smiths such as Umetada Myoju <br/>
and Horikawa Kunihiro. About this time, non oriental foreigners made <br/>
their presence felt in Japan for the first time. Things from <br/>
the "West" were new, exciting, strange, and highly sought after. <br/>
Yasutsugu was one of the first advocates of using namban tetsu <br/>
(foreign steel) in his swords. He proudly incised this fact on the <br/>
nakago of his later works. It was new, it was exciting, and there is <br/>
no doubt that this use of foreign steel helped spread his fameis is <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-883519298">Hi Barry,<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I will check through my sources when I get home later today. I do not recall<br/>
ever seeing a first generation Yasutsugu with a Namban-tetsu inscription,<br/>
and if one exits, being dated will be extraordinary. On the other hand, my<br/>
memory may just be faulty. We can also go back to Oda Nobunaga for the<br/>
foreign dress thing. He is said to have had a Namban-gusoku and his<br/>
standard was a Portuguese hat. He also affected foreign wear. Nonetheless, I<br/>
still suspect that the importation of steel came after the Dutch were set up<br/>
in Dejima, the country was pacified and smiths were largely established in<br/>
large urban centers. That would put the use back past 1615 and the fall of<br/>
Osaka castle. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
It is interesting that Yasutsugu should be negatively compared to Umetada<br/>
Myoju in terms of blade making. Myoju left scant numbers of swords and is<br/>
really not considered much of a sword-smith. Horikawa Kunihiro is largely<br/>
credited with starting the Shinto tradition due to the large number of<br/>
swords he produced and the size of his school, which included the founders<br/>
of the Osaka Shinto. Yasutsugu at his best is excellent, but he seems to<br/>
have produced a lot of so-so stuff.<br/>

Hi, ThAround the 11th or 12th year of this same period of Keicho <br/>
(1606-1607), Yasutsugu's fame reached the point that he was called to <br/>
Edo (Tokyo) to share his time with Tokugawa Ieyasu. About this time <br/>
Yasutsugu was given the privilege of using the character "Yasu" from <br/>
Tokugawa Ieyasu's name. Thus he changed his name to Yasutsugu from <br/>
that point on. About the same time ( some feel it was a few years <br/>
later) he was given the additional privilege of carving the Hollyhock <br/>
crest ( Aoi mon) on his blades. These privileges were given in <br/>
perpetuity to Yasutsugu and his descendents. Thus the Yasutsugu <br/>
swordsmiths became the kaji of the Tokugawa Family.<br/>
<br/>
Earlier I raised the question of what made Yasutsugu's fame and <br/>
fortune seem to spread disproportionately to his skill when we <br/>
compare him to some of his contemporary smiths such as Umetada Myoju <br/>
and Horikawa Kunihiro. About this time, non oriental foreigners made <br/>
their presence felt in Japan for the first time. Things from <br/>
the "West" were new, exciting, strange, and highly sought after. <br/>
Yasutsugu was one of the first advocates of using namban tetsu <br/>
(foreign steel) in his swords. He proudly incised this fact on the <br/>
nakago of his later works. It was new, it was exciting, and there is <br/>
no doubt that this use of foreign steel helped spread his fameis is <br/>

<h3>Re: NAMBAN TETSU</h3>
by <i>drjohnplissenden</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-271851276">It is surely important that we define what exactly we mean by 'namban <br/>
tetsu'.  Since the word 'namban', as adopted by the Japanese during <br/>
the Heian period, was applied to all foreigners, irrespective of <br/>
their origin, the term 'namban iron' should surely be applied to all <br/>
iron not having its origin in the smelting of native ore.<br/>
<br/>
The importation of such iron into Japan from Korea is described in <br/>
writings of the early part of the third century AD, local production <br/>
occurring only a few centuries later than this.  Namban iron thus <br/>
existed in Japan many centuries before the Dutch arrival there.<br/>
<br/>
If, however, you consider - in my opinion, quite wrongly - that the <br/>
term 'namban iron' refers to that of a European source, the Dutch <br/>
started to import iron, with its origins in China, Korea and India, <br/>
in the early C17.  Iron and steel were both imported by the Dutch and <br/>
the English during the C17.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, in defining the term, does one include under the heading <br/>
locally produced iron that contains a proportion of the metal from <br/>
foreign sources? If so - as I believe one should - only iron produced <br/>
locally, exclusively from the smelting of local ore, can be excluded <br/>
from the label of 'namban iron'.<br/>
