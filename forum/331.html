<h3>Archeology and swords</h3>
by <i>Peter A Bleed</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1015268273">Friends,<br/>
      The last time I tried to do this, a number of people got on my case,<br/>
but allow me to call the list's attention to an item I recently bought on<br/>
eBay. I'm not gloating or bragging - well I am, but collectors are allowed<br/>
to do that. My real goal in this posting is to discuss what I think is a<br/>
very interesting sword fitting.<br/>
      It is still to be seen as item 2176985428 on the world's marketplace.<br/>
Please take a look.<br/>
      One of my research interests is the history of Japanese archeological<br/>
research. Usually, archeology is presented as a subject that was introduced<br/>
to Japan in the early Meiji period by Edward Morse. Japan is littered with<br/>
old sites, tho, so there must have been an older interest in ancient stuff.<br/>
Of course there was and I have found evidence of  a fair amount of Edo<br/>
period interest in stuff we now see as prehistoric. There were collectors<br/>
and collectors' groups, and named types. I think there were as well some<br/>
pretty good understandings that objects like stone artifacts reflected old<br/>
ways of doing things. And in that light, I find this tsuka very<br/>
interesting.<br/>
      The "menuki" on this tsuka are absolutely Jomon era arrow points. In<br/>
fact, Jomon points are pretty uniform for thousands of years (unlike the<br/>
case in North America, for example) so it is hard to know the specific age<br/>
of these two artifacts. But that is what they are. Finding them tied into<br/>
Edo period fittings is proof that folks at that time were picking ancient<br/>
objects up, looking at them, and finding them interesting. I think it also<br/>
suggests that somebody must have figured out that these two things were<br/>
some manner of weapon or at least something that went with a sword.<br/>
      Now I have not seen the tsuka - only the images - but based on them<br/>
I see this as a pretty ordinary piece of koshirae - lacquered tsuka-ito,<br/>
but shark skin rather than same, and pretty rustic iron fuchi-kashira. It<br/>
seems to be a katana size so it would be a real samurai's sword, but I see<br/>
it as a "country piece."  Archaeological sites are where you find them, but<br/>
I could certainly believe that a rural samurai, like a country<br/>
administrator or a local land owner, could acquire stone points and find<br/>
them interesting enough to use in this way. Do you all agree?<br/>
      Finally, let me ask the list if anyone out there has ever seen any<br/>
other use of archeological objects on or with  swords or other Edo period<br/>
stuff<br/>
      Thanks for listening.<br/>

Verrry interesting.  I put up a photo of Jomon stone points that I had handy at<br/>
<br/>
 <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://tinyurl.com/dk7y">http://tinyurl.com/dk7y</a> for comparison.  <br/>
<br/>
A friend in Japan has a Kofun jidai gilt yamagane Hoju tsuba in his collection that has had a kozuka ana added and some very wide sekigane installed to modify the ovoid "nakago" ana for mounting on a conventional koshirae.  I'd speculate that it was unearthed sometime during the Edo period, was recognized as a sword guard and modified for use on a then contemporary wakizashi koshirae.  The kozuka ana and sekigane are definitely not original, and wouldn't have been added if the guard was only kept as a curiosity, it must have been worn.  After seeing your tsuka, I wonder what the rest of the fittings on that sword were like.  <br/>

	I was tempted to bid on that piece as well. congratulations I <br/>
think the right man picked it up. As you say the same is very plain, <br/>
however the tsukaito looks to be nicely done. It may be one of a kind.<br/>
