<h3>tsuba plates</h3>
by <i>alchemyst</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1509203723">I've noticed a fair number of tsuba have forging/folding<br/>
flaws between the hitsu ana and nakago ana. I assume this<br/>
is indicative of an "S" type fold, katchushi style. Question-<br/>
since many of the old tosho and katchushi styles were re-done<br/>
in the revival period, ca 1850, were the plates made in the<br/>
old style also or just "factory" plates. Jim's article on<br/>
tsuba plates leads me to the revival plates were not likely<br/>
made like the old ones. Just wondering.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
