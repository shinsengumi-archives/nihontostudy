<div id="ygrps-yiv-1060232630">Granted the tang has that "Chinese pickled" look, but otherwise it looks like a real katana to me in a battered WW2 shingunto koshirae.  Need better closeup images of the tsuba etc etc to study the finer detail.  Also some carefully chosen closeups of the blade.<br/>
<br/>
While I'm here, a couple years back I got a call from a man who had found me through the local Japanese Consul General's office here in Oz.  He was a collector, had 25 swords, and had been collecting for three years!!  Every one of his swords was a Chinese "creation".  Disappointing for sure.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1394079345">Hi all - <br/>
<br/>
One of the now-famous "Chinese" Japanese swords came to me for opinion this week. Talking to the fellow prior to the visit, I felt he had to be describing a "ringer." You wouldn't believe what he all saw in that sword and how excited he was about this "ancient" sword! I did ask if he wanted "the truth" about if when he came over, and he said yes. It took a couple hours and some show-and-tell to convince him. (He swore some Japanese offered him $10K for this sword six months back!) <br/>
<br/>
My question here today...this sword had the typical "etched" hada that you could see from across the room. Has anyone figured out if these swords are being actually "forged and acid etched" or if this so-called "hada" is applied and etched (probably similar to fake damascus)? I couldn't say one way or the other 100% but suspect it is "applied." The nakago looked raw and certainly not something that even a blacksmith would make. Odd kanji, etc., and unfinished. <br/>

<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
More troubling to me than the background of this sword is the penchant for<br/>
many to get a little knowledge and then go crazy about something they have<br/>
bought, even to the point of making up stories about it. IÂve had numerous<br/>
individuals come up and ask me what I think of the quality of utsuri in<br/>
their blade, the amount of kinsuji, or to comment on the beauty of the<br/>
chikei, when none of the features were present. ItÂs as if learning jargon<br/>
is taking the place of actual study Â hands on study with good swords that<br/>
actual have some of these features. Then, it would not be possible for there<br/>
to be a market for these Chinese swords. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I might add that I myself, and even Yoshikawa sensei, have been sent e-mails<br/>
or letters from Thailand, Indonesia and who knows where else asking us to<br/>
either buy or to comment on this garbage. In each case I have told the<br/>
individual exactly what they have, if they bought them, they should report<br/>
the seller for fraud, or if they are the seller, warning them that they can<br/>
be prosecuted for attempting to perpetrate a fraud. Unfortunately, people<br/>
are still being taken. I would hope that when Bob Benson or anyone else puts<br/>
on a display of top quality pieces somewhere in the States, everyone takes<br/>
the opportunity to go and learn.<br/>
