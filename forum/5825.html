> Unfortunately, a Sacramento-area sword collector was the victim of a  <br/>
> burglary.  The burglar will likely try to sell the stolen items.   <br/>
> So, please be on the look-out for any of the following items.<br/>
><br/>
>  - Two Yasunori katana.  One was dated Showa 18, is an unusually  <br/>
> long 27 inches (the normal length is 26 inches, and is in Type 98  <br/>
> military mounts with family crests (mon).<br/>
><br/>
>  - A Yasutoku katana dated Showa 15, is 26 and 1/4 inches long, and  <br/>
> is in Type 98 military mounts with family crests.<br/>
><br/>
>  - An Awataguchi Tadatsuna wakizashi with a 21 inch cutting edge.<br/>
><br/>
>  - A mounted Enju school katana approximately 30 inches long.<br/>
><br/>
>  - A late World War II Type 44 green scabbard.<br/>
><br/>
>  - A military gunto blade that was in the process of polishing.<br/>
><br/>
>  - Three or four Type 98 military mounts with tsunagi (wood filler  <br/>
> blades).  One of the mounts, unusually, had copper fittings.<br/>
><br/>
>  - A koto Morimitsu tachi approximately 28 inches long, ubu (the  <br/>

><br/>
> The burglary occurred on Monday June 13 at approximately 9:30 a.m.   <br/>
> The burglar was driving a navy blue pick-up truck.  Evidence  <br/>
> indicates the burglar was not knowledgeable about swords.  Again,  <br/>
> please be on the look-out for any of these items.  Also, please feel  <br/>
> free to forward this E-mail message to others who may see these  <br/>
