<h3>iron tsuba versus steel tsuba</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1009945462">I was reading that Akiyama Kyusaku, the authority whose views on tsuba were formative for both Torigoye and Sasano, evidently actually distinguished tsuba made from steel hagane 鋼 from tsuba made from iron tetsu 鉄.

I have heard, and read, a great deal of discussion about the importance of the quality of the tsuba's plate, but I have not heard much about the differences between iron and steel tsuba.  Do the experts of today make that distinction?<br/>

Well, iron vs. steel is a matter of the carbon content.  <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
In the Torigoye/Haynes "Tsuba an Aesthetic Study" there is a four step breakdown of hardness/carbon content:<br/>
<br/>
Goku Koko (very hard) C > 1.0%<br/>
Koko  (hard) 0.5% < C < 1.0%<br/>
Nanko (soft) 0.25% < C < 0.5%<br/>
Goku Nanko (very soft) C < 0.25 %<br/>
<br/>
Of course the actual hardness depends on final heat treatment, so I'm not entirely sure how to take that.<br/>
<br/>
I would be surprised if there isn't variation in the percentage carbon between guards, but I haven't seen any such metallurgical analysis.  A correlation of measured hardness, carbon content and visual appearance across a group of tsuba would be interesting.  I wouldn't be surprised if other factors (surface finish, applied patina, oxidation over time) confused any correlation of appearance with measured physical characteristics.<br/>
<br/>
Lacking data, here are some more anecdotes and random thoughts.<br/>
<br/>
We hear about modern swordsmiths sorting their tamahagane by carbon content based on its color and texture, but this is before forging.  Appearance after forging is another matter.  <br/>
<br/>
Yoshindo Yoshihara makes tosho and katchushi style tsuba after the old styles and bases his methods on observations from the originals.  I talked to him about his methods a few years ago.  He said that he sometimes uses ordinary iron for his guards and sometimes tamahagane.  If he uses tamahagane, he takes it from the low carbon portion of the bloom.  He said that he does not use steel.  He said that he could tell the difference in how the material (low C tamahagane vs. non-tatara iron)  worked, but that there were no visible differences in the finished product.<br/>
<br/>
He does not do any sort of quench hardening.  "Just hammered iron.  Not very hard."  That doesn't mean that it was done that way in the past, but I have checked this out with restorers of old guards and none of them had encountered a guard hard enough to have been quench hardened.  This seems sensible since a hardened guard would also be a brittle guard.  Of course if he's using iron, it cannot be quench hardened anyway.<br/>
<br/>
Even high carbon tool steel can be annealed to be quite soft.  If guards are forged to shape and left to cool, it's not clear to me how much influence carbon content is going to have on actual hardness.  I think that there's a bunch we don't know about the final heat treatment of historical guards, though.  How much does the real hardness vary?  Some guards do look harder than others, is there a physical difference?<br/>
<br/>
Tekkotsu are described as regions of high carbon content.  That would imply steel or even beyond, at least in spots.  Guards with tekkotsu tend to be very slow to take on a natural patina when hanging outside when compared to softer (looking) guards that can recolor fairly quickly.  Corrosion resistance can be affected by impurities.  Tekkotsu often look blacker and smoother than the surrounding metal.  I can believe that the percentage of carbon might have been varied for aesthetic reasons even if not for mechanical ones.  Using oroshigane the smith can vary the carbon content of his metal at will.<br/>
<br/>
It's hard to say how many of the traditional explanations are based on data.  Of course when it comes to kantei, you have to go on what you can sense, so it brings us back to these terms being qualitative rather than quantitative.<br/>

The hardness and the dimensions both affect the tone of a bell, if I remember ancient physics.  As a practical matter, for "real" tsuba the dimensions seem to be the bigger factor.  (Larger and/or thinner being lower in tone.)  <br/>
<br/>
BUT, I have seen (heard) modern-made tsuba that have a very high tone for their size and it would probably be because of the heat treatment/hardness of the metal.  Harder will be higher in pitch. <br/>
<br/>
I don't know whether there would be enough difference in tone among real guards of similar size and shape to enable judging the hardness of the metal.  It seems worth messing with to see.<br/>
