<h3>correspondence help from interested parties</h3>
by <i>excelsiorilluminati</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-932003427">A fellow I know and his kantei group have come upon some correspondence <br/>
between Messrs. Robinson and Caldwell having to do with their <br/>
investigation of nihonto just post war. I have been asked if there are <br/>
other sources of original (in facsimile) material and documentation <br/>
that could be made available to supplement these letters. The project <br/>
is in preliminary stages and any source is not too small at this point. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1213673319">I have a couple of things from Robinson.   One is a copy of his book signed with a inscription <br/>
when he gave it to Dr Compton - very cool, but not much information content, just a <br/>
reference to happy sword collecting.   The other is a letter from Robinson (who had amazing <br/>
penmanship) to the owner of a sword that I now own describing at length who made the <br/>
sword, where it was made etc.   Let me know if this would be of any interest.   Cheers, Bob.  -<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1921207128">Hi John.   Sorry it has taken so long to get back to you.    I have  <br/>
found the copy of the letter as well as the book inscribed to Dr  <br/>
Compton.   I am still looking for a note that I found in another  <br/>
book.   It is some scribbling about a sword that I assume that BW  <br/>
Robinson was studying.    If you don't mind, I will look a little  <br/>
more for that.   If I don't find it, then I will just send these.    <br/>
If you are pressed for time, I can send you these and whenever I run  <br/>
across the other again try to find your address and send it.    <br/>
CHeers, Bob<br/>
