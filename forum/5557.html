<h3>Nobuiye</h3>

<br/>
Thought I'd through this out for discussion...<br/>
<br/>
The tortuous shell pattern (also referred to as simply "hexigan" motif) is found on many of the Nobuiye revival made tsuba -- often, tosho tsuba -- of shinshin-to times. Looking at examples of Nobuiye work, this motif does frequently appear on his tsuba. Has anyone ever found reference to WHY this motif was so often used by Nobuiye? Does it relate to something that was particularly meaningful to Nobuiye? Does anyone ever recall reading anything on this? It would seem doubtful that it was used simply because it was a pleasing pattern to adorn tsuba. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1807024463">Interesting question Ron.   I myself have a Nobuiye with that hexagonal design.    It is not well known or often discussed, but I have heard that Nobuiye for several years had a significant clandestine relationship with a turtle.  I hope this helps.   Cheers, Bob  PS, sorry but couldn't resist the opportunity for some levity.  B<br/>
