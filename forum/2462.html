<div id="ygrps-yiv-1734999072">Rich,<br/>
Pieces like that seem to have been used to change the shape of the seppa dai to accommodate a certain shape and/or size of saya and tsuka.  There are tsuba where the seppa dai has been enlarged by fitting pieces all of the way around.  Sometimes various pieces (including the more common hitsuana plugs) are inserted by a later collector to restore the look of the guard to something like what he believes to be its original state.<br/>
<br/>
I could imagine a piece like being inserted to repair damage if it were somewhere else on the guard.  It's hard to imagine how that particular spot would be damaged.  <br/>
<br/>
I have seen a fair number of tsuba that have a pronounced asymmetry to the shape of the seppa dai in that location.  There is metal "missing" from the same position at the upper right.  My guess is that at some time and/or place a slightly asymmetrical tsuka or saya shape was in style and that tsuba were either made or modified to accommodate that shape.  I haven't come across such a koshirae and not being a sword user I can't guess as to why such a shape might be desirable.  <br/>
<br/>
The insert on your guard might be an attempt to change one of these tsuba to the more common symmetrical oval shape.<br/>
<br/>
Any other ideas?<br/>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1047167918">Dear Rich<br/>
<br/>
At the risk of climbing onto my personal hobby horse, I cannot <br/>
accept the suggestion that the illustrated tsuba is Namban.  Even <br/>
accepting the redundant definition of Namban tsuba as being 'work <br/>
exhibiting foreign influences',I am unable to reconise any foreign - <br/>
even Chinese - influences on this guard.  Even were such influences <br/>
be present, it would surely qualify as Hizen rather than as Namban <br/>
work? <br/>
<br/>
My impression, although I would hate to have to present a reasoned <br/>
argument for it, is rather of Miochin work.  Is this an acceptable <br/>
label?<br/>

Namban tsuba. Must agree with other commenst that this does not look namban (or even Hizen) to me. Being smallish in size and with that well-rounded edge, I wonder if this might be Satsuma work. Just a gut-feeling guess.  <br/>

  Thanks Jim, interesting thought's, I had not looked at it with the <br/>
  thought of the plug not being there. I will try that tonight. Welcome <br/>
  back and happy new year to you and the family.<br/>
<br/>
  another few for interest, the first one, I have been getting indications <br/>
  this is Namban maybe, I have no idea hat the symbols are though Barry <br/>
  Thomas says he has an almost identical tsuba catalogued in a book from <br/>
  the early 1900's he is going to dig out for me.<br/>
<br/>
  Namban ?<br/>

  Akasaka. I am hoping early more so than later. Construction layers are <br/>
  visible but I have not determined how many and will look closer on the <br/>
  weekend<br/>

  Ichiryu Tomoyoshi. Dr. Robson tells me there is an exact same tsuba in <br/>
  the book Mito katana to Tosogu no Meihin and thinks whilst the mei is a <br/>
  little different, it could be the shodai or one of the students. I am <br/>
  waiting to here if anyone has a copy of this or in fact, how much this <br/>
  book is.<br/>

<h3>Re: [nihontostudy] back on track with a tsuba question</h3>
by <i>yamaimojg</i>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1269668711">Hirado Kunishige and others made nanban-style fittings in brass decorated with nonsense inscriptions in roman characters.  Some of the letters are correct, but others are upside down, backwards or simply made up.  Some resemble Greek letters.<br/>
<br/>
This isn't Kunishige's work and the characters, whatever they are, are more "freestyle" than is usually seen in that type of nanban work.  A couple of the characters do resemble tensho script.  It's not one of the common nanban styles, but dote mimi examples do exist and the iron has the grainy quality seen in a lot of nanban tsuba.<br/>
<br/>
Late Hoan would usually be etched rather than carved.  The iron, finishing and carving don't look like Myochin, although they did make small, bold guards.  As always, seeing it in person could give a different impression.<br/>

  All, yes, that was a responce I was puzzled by, thus I threw it out <br/>
  there, here is another I have had and like<br/>
<br/>
  I believe they represent the most ancient form of Chinese characters. Oracle bone inscriptions from the <br/>
  Shang -Zhou dynasty (2000-1000 BC)Stone drum inscriptions from the Warring states period (3rd cent. BC). <br/>
  I have seen similar tsuba papered as later Hoan by the Fittings Museum.<br/>
<br/>
  I believe this tsuba may be a copy of something, there is a rather 'ODD' feel to it, it is pretty light for it's size as well.<br/>
