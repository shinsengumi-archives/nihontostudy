<h3>Kyu Gunto? help</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-872892518">Hi, all.  <br/>
<br/>
I just joined the group, looking for information.  I hope this post is<br/>
appropriate.<br/>
<br/>
I have a sword that was given to me by my father.  I believe he<br/>
acquired it in the mid 1960s from someone who brought it back from<br/>
WWII.  I know I remember him having it before 1968.  As far as I can<br/>
tell from my research on the 'net, it is a 'kyu gunto.'<br/>
<br/>
I'm trying to find the value of this sword.  I know that an appraisal<br/>
cannot be done via the 'net, but I'm hoping someone could give me<br/>
estimated upper and lower limits, so I can decide if it is even worth<br/>
pursuing an official appraisal.<br/>
<br/>
The only local (northern Georgia, USA) help I have found is a referral<br/>
to someone who has a booth at the local gun shows, who supposedly buys<br/>
and sells Japanese militaria.  Eastman is having a gun show in Atlanta<br/>
this weekend and in Gainesville next weekend, and I'm trying to decide<br/>
whether it is worth driving there and paying to get in the show, for<br/>
the possiblity of getting an appraisal.<br/>
<br/>
If you feel inclined to take a look at some photos and give me clue<br/>
whether I have something of value or just a piece of junk, I would<br/>
appreciate it.  To that end I have posted some photos on my website at<br/>
