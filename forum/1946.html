At least it is someone interpreting the Kaneie style.  The motif is a<br/>
memento mori as you say.  Sometimes that motif is tied to Sekigahara,<br/>
but seems like it could fit any battle.<br/>

Yes, I too wondered about kodogu shinsa, having several signed kinko tsuba that could benefit from a respected peer's okay-dokay! It would be good to know the judge's strong areas of kantie.<br/>
<br/>
Has anybody heard how the shinsa slots are going for Chicago? Are they approaching a full booking or not? I was going to call Coleman and ask (which I might still do) but perhaps the question has already been answered. <br/>

Hagihara-sensei and Tanobe-sensei seem to still be seen as the young guys in Japan.  I'm a little concerned about your point as well.  I asked about any younger people seriously studying fittings a few years ago and the reply was that they're only interested in clothes, cars and vacations.  Also, that nobody gets interested in antiques until they're fifty.  Certainly the people you mention got started younger than that.  Anyone have some more up to date information?<br/>

	Don't give up hope yet. There were several "Gen-Xers" who were regular <br/>
attendees at the monthly kantei-kai. Most notably the young Mr <br/>
Fujishiro and his friends (there were always three or four), they <br/>
always dressed sharp and took the whole thing very seriously. While <br/>
others used the Dokuhon, they used only the Fujishiro Jiten and often <br/>
left early having sussed out the swords with their first bids. There <br/>
are young polishers and collectors out there, several young ladies who <br/>
study at the Sanno, and others who I am I am sure we never run into. <br/>
Who will be the next leaders? Can't say for sure but they are there...<br/>

    Chicago? It matters a lot to me in terms of what I bring. Thank you.<br/>
