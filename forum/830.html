<div id="ygrps-yiv-1947929988">The book is about the Dutch collection of Nihinto and some koshirae.<br/>
It will be a non-profit book.<br/>
Mr. Han made more then 450 discriptions from swords in Holland.<br/>
(he made 1 mistake in 35 years of collecting, this sword didn't pas <br/>
shinsa)<br/>
<br/>
Now he is getting older and he is stopping collecting swords.<br/>
The last sword he bought (back) was Fujiwara Sadakiyo from the <br/>
Yamato hosho school.<br/>
This blade was sold by Sothebys in the 1970's, he didn't bought it <br/>
that time. <br/>
It was in gunto mounts.<br/>
It was sold for 170 Dutch guldends, about 70US$.<br/>
10 years later he saw in the Token Bijutsu that it get Juyo.<br/>
So, from this time he want to buy it back.<br/>
2 years ago it was for sale again.<br/>
I was in Japan for the Kobe Taikai and I took it back for him to <br/>
Holland.<br/>
<br/>
This kind of stories are also in the book, together with 40 pictures <br/>
from swords and some full colour pictures from koshirea.<br/>
Tanobe sensei did the foreword.<br/>
<br/>
When people want to buy this book,,, then let me know.<br/>
