In the above paper Dr. Takeuchi mentions the 'chiisa-gatana' (see <br/>
below excerpt) as well as the uchigatana evolution.  I have been <br/>
wondering for some time now why there were transitions in size of <br/>
tsuba during the Nanbokucho to Momoyama Jidai and would like to know <br/>
if one of the members could help pull this together for me.  It seems <br/>
to make sense that shorter one-hand use swords would require smaller <br/>
tsuba and I believe that this would explain some of the smaller tsuba <br/>
such as some Kanayama pieces one finds during the Muromachi and <br/>
Momoyama.  It's just bothered me that we start with very large Tosho <br/>
pieces then see much smaller ones, then move to larger sukashi ones <br/>
as we move through the warring states period.  Any help much <br/>
appreciated.<br/>
<br/>
"Historically, the emergence of the usage of the term "wakizashi" to <br/>
refer to "an established category of swords within a specific range <br/>
of length (measured by the distance between the ha-machi and the <br/>
kissaki)" that were commonly and officially (after the Tokugawa <br/>
Shogunate had issued an executive order) worn by the samurai is <br/>
relatively a new phenomenon. In fact, it was only after the beginning <br/>
of the shin-to period, thus mainly post-Muromachi and especially Edo <br/>
period. Prior to this, that is when the samurai's "main sword" had <br/>
been a tachi (i.e, ko-to, thus pre-Muromachi period), they most often <br/>
used to "wear" different types of "side/peripheral swords such <br/>
as "yoroi-doshi" (by inserting between obi), "chiisa-gatana" (by <br/>
inserting between obi) and "koshi-gatana" (by mostly inserting <br/>
between obi, but sometimes hanging it from obi) (Ogasawara, 1994b).<br/>
[Note. For the academic and historical classification of "chisa-<br/>
gatana," and its relations to "koshi-gatana" and "tanto," see <br/>
Ogasawara, 1994a and 1994b.]"</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-61727658">A while back Mr. Gilbert had taken the time to do a spreadsheet of tsuba <br/>
size/type vs. saya length of the pieces shown in the tokyo museum's<br/>
uchigatana koshirae book - I've got a copy somewhere, but migh it be in <br/>
this list's archives/download area?<br/>
