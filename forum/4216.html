<h3>Nihonto books, eBay vs Amazon</h3>
by <i>apedraza_93</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1446679173">My usual rant regarding book auctions on eBay, with an added twist.<br/>
<br/>
Amazon price including shipping for new book: 	$28.36 	<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://tinyurl.com/pumve">http://tinyurl.com/pumve</a><br/>
eBay final auction price plus $10 S&H:		$55.00	<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://tinyurl.com/qybaa">http://tinyurl.com/qybaa</a><br/>
<br/>
I'm blown away by people willing to spend twice what a book costs <br/>
just because they're not willing to spend a minute doing a simple <br/>
search. I guess their income must be way higher than mine. Also, I <br/>
think I'm going to start selling books on eBay and then just ship <br/>
them straight from Amazon, pocketing the difference.<br/>
<br/>
The added twist is that I'm sure most of these books on polishing <br/>
have resulted in good blades being damaged by people who think it's <br/>
as easy as sharpening the steak knives at home. Polishing should be <br/>
left to professionals.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for listening (reading) to my rant.<br/>
<br/>
Best Regards,<br/>
<br/>

I would agree. Arbitrage away.<br/>
<br/>
AMZN stock is -27% on the year. It could use some<br/>
help! Getting squashed in a bull stock market where<br/>
everything else is going bonkers. Even Heinz "the<br/>
ketchup company" is up +24%.<br/>
   We're a bit irrational. If you can make money off<br/>
it and buy a sword or two; lead the way.<br/>
