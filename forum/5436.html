<div id="ygrps-yiv-679045171">Dear List,<br/>
<br/>
Having just committed to a master bathroom remodel, a friend just offered me this morning a tanto w/ important koshirae that I have wanted for quite a while. It figures!<br/>
<br/>
I am trying to raise funds a wee bit on the fast side. I've listed my Oei Bizen Morokage (2 sets of Yoshikawa NTHK papers, sashikomi polish supposedly by Kentaro Yoshikawa) with Darcy at:   www.nihonto.ca<br/>
<br/>
Direct link:  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.nihonto.ca/morokage/index.html">http://www.nihonto.ca/morokage/index.html</a><br/>
<br/>
click through the link and see all the photos. The photos are not the best because I did not send the sword to Darcy for photographs. It is a very beautiful and elegant sword.<br/>
<br/>
****   Price is listed at $8500 but I will cut it to ____$7500_____ and if others want to make me counter offers in the next 2 weeks, I will consider them.  I've turned down offers at $7,500 before- but special circumstances rule for now. ****<br/>
<br/>
Please contact me off list if interested.<br/>
