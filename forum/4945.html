<h3>kogatana mei</h3>
by <i>elliottshogun</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-910643870">It's me again...........<br/>
<br/>
I am seeking any information about.... Omi Daijo Fujiwara Tadashiro .<br/>
The kogatana that I have has this mei. I cannot find the <br/>
name 'Tadashiro' anywhere. And since I cannot read kanji, I question <br/>
this name.<br/>
<br/>
As soon as I can get a viewable picture of this mei (and another), I <br/>
will post to my album for all to critique. Meanwhile with your help, I <br/>
will continue searching........<br/>
<br/>
Thanks as always,<br/>

<br/>
Firstly the name is TADAHIRO, not TADASHIRO.  I am well acquainted with this smith as I have had a katana of his for many years plus others of the school are well-known to me in other collections.  And I have the Hizento Taikan.  And I have a book on kogatana.  So, please post me pics direct or I'm happy to look at them in your album.  Higher res is better then lower res to send me direct, as you might resize them down for your album.<br/>
<br/>
I'm presuming here that you want to know if the mei is genuine??<br/>
<br/>
Regards,<br/>
Barry Thomas.<br/>

I did not doubt the mei, it was being told that it was TADASHIRO and <br/>
not finding that name anywhere. I looked in the Haynes index (which I <br/>
now proudly own) and found no such name. It is without a doubt <br/>
TADAHIRO.<br/>
<br/>
I will send you pic's of another kogatana that has a mei. It looks <br/>
very suspicious to me, and I have no idea what it says. I will post <br/>
them into my album and send you same directly. Maybe it will be <br/>
legit, maybe not. Somebody at some time has tried to fake a hamon on <br/>
this little blade. I need to remove this, any ideas? I don't want to <br/>
spend any money on this blade unless the mei is real. Let me know <br/>
your thoughts. It's a learning experience!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
