<h3>Tsuba kantie</h3>
by <i>sworddad</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-464325846">Hi - <br/>
<br/>
I'm seeking some comments on an interesting old tsuba in my collection. It is iron sukashi work of a very unusual (undescribable, to me) shape and design. It measures 70mm x 58mm x 6mm and has remnants of black lacquer remaining on it. The hitsu-ana pillows are interesting in that hey are double-layered, the inside inlay being shakudo with a silver  overlaid plate. The tsuba has not been cut down so this is its original shape, in my opinion. Obviously it has been refitted many times. A photo is posted in nihontostudy pictures under Ron STL.  (posted under two groups...so one should work for you.)<br/>

Looking at "kiri" in Chappelear's mon book I looked further and discovered that the "ivy" better represents what this design is on my tsuba. The "kiri" of course has the three "blooms" and the "ivy" does not. Check out p.37, particularly the left column, third up. I think that's it. As for the other sukashi designs between the "ivy," could be anybody's guess. <br/>
<br/>
I've added another photo to my file, one with a black background if anyone's interested in looking. Its a little more realistic (patina). <br/>

Top and bottom of the tsuba are the sukashi mon of the<br/>
Mickey Mouse clan of Higo.<br/>
<br/>
Only slightly more seriously, the kozuka / kogai ana<br/>
have the buddhist pole (or baby bottle shape) that I<br/>
usually associate with Higo designs. After that, you<br/>
need to make the call whether the metal matches to any<br/>
other Higo tsuba you've seen.<br/>
<br/>
Odd tsuba. Nice to see it.<br/>

To comment briefly on your fascinating and enigmatic tsuba, the <br/>
openings at the four corners of the guard are reminiscent, to me, of <br/>
the entrants that are more commonly tri-lobed, and appear singly on <br/>
old, aoie-shaped tsuba.  Not that this is of any help at all of <br/>
course, since I believe that nobody has yet proposed a possible <br/>
significance for these!<br/>

	I agree the cut-out shapes could be sotoba but I am looking at the  <br/>
positive outline and see four bats around the rim. Whatever it is  <br/>
this is the most interesting piece I've seen posted in a while, I  <br/>
love anything that can't be catagorized other than "solid". This  <br/>
looks to be a solid piece o tsuba...<br/>
