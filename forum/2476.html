Just acquired this iron katana size tsuba.<br/>
Motif is that of rabbit with mallet set against a full moon.<br/>
It is signed Umetada Shichizaemon Tachibana ( ? ) Shigeyoshi saku.<br/>
a mid-edo period tsuba maker  .<br/>
The flip side shows a crescent moon with waves.<br/>
Interesting thing is that the moon is overlay with VERY THIN silver <br/>
nunome now darken to same color as the iron plate.  The " bumps " on <br/>
the moon surface, I believe, represents that mythical tree.<br/>
<br/>
Along the rim are " chisel marks "  ( can be seen in one of the <br/>
pic ), there are 6 on each side.<br/>
Question ........... are these marks for retention of a soft metal <br/>
rim now missing  ? or are they " secret " identity marks of the tsuba <br/>
maker ?<br/>

<h3>Ichiryu Tomoyoshi</h3>
by <i>retalt</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1332536051">all, I am looking for a visual reference of a mei from the Mito tosogu <br/>
Ichiryu Tomoyoshi. Does anyone have one, that is confirmed legitimate ? <br/>
i.e. papered or a reference of one published, I have a couple in my <br/>
books but they are too hard to see in the printing. I also see a kogai <br/>
and kozuka on AOI but again, small image syndrome.<br/>
<br/>
cheers<br/>

Nunome is often seen in Umetada work and indeed silver will become very dark with time.<br/>
<br/>
The rabbit is associated with waves, pounding mochi (with that mallet) and the moon, as I'm sure you know.  It's an interesting interlocking set of motifs.<br/>
<br/>
I very much doubt that there was a fukurin or that the chiseling is a secret mark.  I think it's just to add decorative interest to the rim.  Worm eaten / rotten wood decorative devices like that were popular with the Umetada and Shoami as well as others to give an aged/rustic feeling.<br/>
