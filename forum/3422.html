<h3>Katana/nagamaki with naginata-hi and blade inscriptiion</h3>
by <i>sigp210</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1803747936">Hi All,<br/>
Pardon the cross posting on the forums, but I am looking for info on a<br/>
rather unusual sword.<br/>
A friend has owned this sword for many years that I quite fancy. Very<br/>
long nagasa, and appears to be o-surige. Has an o-kissaki, and well<br/>
cut naginata-type hi. Nakago looks to be around shinshinto period, but<br/>
just my novice opinion.<br/>
What is odd about the sword (apart from the fact that it looks like a<br/>
nagamaki blade made into a katana) is the inscription on the blade on<br/>
both sides.<br/>
Sorry for the bad pics. Only had 5 minutes to take these limited pics<br/>
today, and had to do them in segments in bad light. The sword has a<br/>
beefy blade, with some weight to it, and the hi are very nicely cut.<br/>
Hamon is not very visible in the pics, but is clearly visible in<br/>
person, and quite wide suguha.<br/>
Anyways, a translation done very long ago supposedly came up with<br/>
something along the lines of "I am so sharp, I can cut clouds" but I<br/>
have strong doubts about this.<br/>
Looking for a translation from anyone please.<br/>
What would the significance of the inscription be, and could it be a<br/>
gift sword or a dedication, or a commission blade? Fittings are nice<br/>
tachi mounts, and the blade doesn't appear to my humble eyes to be a<br/>
junk sword. Original nagasa would be estimated at well over 28"<br/>
originally.<br/>
<br/>
A post on another forum gave the following helpful info:<br/>
"This inscription is most likely a reference to something found in<br/>
Chinese literature or Chinese mythology. I say this because its not<br/>
made up of typical Japanese compounds and doesn't resemble any<br/>
Buddhist phrases that one typically sees on swords. I think the 3rd<br/>
and 4th kanji combine to form the word "lightning" in Chinese<br/>
(somebody correct me if I'm wrong), but the word for lightning in<br/>
Japanese uses a different kanji. Read kanji-for-kanji as Japanese you<br/>
end up with a jumble of word roots. The kanji on the left are<br/>
&#21091;&#20809;&#38275;&#38651;&#38829;&#20992;&#36637;&#30772;&#28014;&#38642;<br/>
When translated it reads; sword, light, lightning (taking the Chinese<br/>
reading), whip, katana, brilliant, rupture, floating, and cloud. It<br/>
doesn't take much imagination to read this as you have stated in your<br/>
post ("Lightning-flashing, cloud-rupturing sword"). But as I say its<br/>
probably a direct reference to a particular myth or poem, which<br/>
contains this exact phrase. The owner would then have the added bonus<br/>
of appearing quite erudite and well-read in the Chinese classics. I<br/>
think samurai were keen on secret societies and this inscription may<br/>
have some significance in this context as well. In any event its not a<br/>
phrase that you would encounter in Japanese, which leads me to believe<br/>
it's a Chinese literary reference."<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-817834373">Ah, well, Dear Blokes -<br/>
<br/>
There is the original saying "Fools rush in where Angels fear to tread",<br/>
modified by me to read "Barry Thomas opens his mouth so others can put their<br/>
feet in"...<br/>
<br/>
So, here we go:<br/>
<br/>
Ah, the dreaded red lacquer in the grooves - in this case, the kanji.  The<br/>
characters are neither well-cut nor well-balanced, IMHO.  To me this looks like<br/>
a Shinshinto crapper with red lacquer in the kanji!!!   IMHO the kanji are not<br/>
well carved, as I said, and the whole thing reeks of a tourist trap to me!!!  At<br/>
best it is a genuine Boshin War piece, but the quality doesn't strike me from<br/>
these pics as anything marvellous.  See the two ware evident in the picture, for<br/>
example.  Also, the hamon looks weak.  It is always better to have a sword "in<br/>
the hand", but as opinions are being sought on the basis of the pictures I have<br/>
given the best opinion I'm capable of.  It would have been helpful to see the<br/>
nakago and boshi as well to augment "the story" as we need to see a sword in its<br/>
totality, and not just a "selected slice"...  Oh, congratulations to whoever<br/>
stitched the images together.  Nice job.<br/>
<br/>
Best regards,<br/>
<br/>
Barry Thomas.<br/>
