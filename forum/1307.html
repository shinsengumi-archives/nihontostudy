<h3>Info on a Umetada School Tsuba</h3>
by <i>taipan0723</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1921594180">Hello,<br/>
This is my first post on this board, so please excuse any mistakes on <br/>
my part.  I've posted two pictures in the photo files under <br/>
Taipan0723 of a Tsuba I have.  I've been told the mei reads Umetada.  <br/>
All of the Umetada School Tsubas I've seen pictures of are non-<br/>
pierced.  Any information on this Tsuba would be greatly appreciated.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in Advance,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1662282462">Here's another thought, though it looks like it is a large tsuba, <br/>
i.e. Katana size. It would work well on a Naginata or simular that <br/>
was concverted into a sword. See this link at the Sumie sisters site <br/>
for a naginata that was converted into a Wakizashi. Notice the shape <br/>
of the Habaki.<br/>

Please ignore previous email. Figured out what I was<br/>
doing wrong.<br/>
<br/>
Mark's tsuba is signed UmeTada but is a little rough.<br/>
I have an Umetada School with a good signature that I<br/>
keep as my reference piece. It is a beautiful (&heavy)<br/>
tsuba where someone pried out the precious metals of<br/>
an otherwise excellent design. Otherwise, its the sort<br/>
of tsuba I think of as 'Umetada'.<br/>
   Mark's tsuba is very different. Anyone feel up to<br/>
teaching us both about Umetadas or pointing us to good<br/>
references? So far I've read only the Art&Sword<br/>
article and the Nihon_To_Koza. Will gladly post my<br/>
tsuba as a comparison/contrast piece.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1091605514">Mark,<br/>
Thanks for posting.  The Umetada produced a wide range of work.  Most books and major collections tend to focus on the famous style of Myoju and other early workers.  A lot of that work of course does not have any sukashi decoration.  Some do have small areas that are cut out, but I cannot recall any early work that is similar to yours.<br/>
<br/>
I've heard a comment along the lines of "everywhere around the country where there were Shoami, there were also Umetada competing with them."  I think that I heard this from Bob Haynes who I think attributed it to John Yumoto.  Whether entirely true or not, there were a lot of later Umetada people working in a variety of popular styles.  Also, there are very high quality Umetada and Shoami tsuba from Kyoto that are very similar in style and execution.<br/>
<br/>
Without the signature, I'd probably think that your tsuba was Kyo Shoami.  It's not too hard to believe that there was some individual or workshop associated with the Umetada group that was making a similar style and sometimes signing them.  I'm not aware of any research on this particular type of guard by an Umetada group, or on the two character signature like that.  Keep looking through the books and see if you can find anything similar with a longer signature.  It's possible that the signature was added later, but I'm not sure that an Umetada nijimei would bring any more prestige than adding a gimei Shoami.<br/>
