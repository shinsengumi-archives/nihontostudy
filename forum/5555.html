<h3>Naokatsu swordsmith tsuba</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-529696704">Hi All - <br/>
<br/>
This is kind of a long-shot unless one of you are interested in shinshin-to smith Jirotaro Naokatsu's work with tsuba. These appear on the market from time to time, some examples more interesting than others. <br/>
<br/>
Examples of how they are signed seem to range from "Jirotaro Naokatsu" to niji-mei "Naokatsu" to "Fujiwara Naokatsu." Does anyone have any research available if any of these mei-forms indicate the level of his works? Of course what "seems" somewhat logical, his "signed long" tsuba might indicate his better works, but then that's just my personal guess-work. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-319530914">Hi Ron, just back from the Sydney Shinsa were we papered a mumei tsuba <br/>
to Nakatsu or Naooki (he was in charge of Naokatsu's) forge. The guard <br/>
has been on my mind fore a few days. I used to have a tsuba now with you <br/>
by Naooki so I have some stuff kicking about on the group. Let me look <br/>
tonight.<br/>
