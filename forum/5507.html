<div id="ygrps-yiv-1572326434">Thanks Gary, for the "Calls 'em as I sees 'em" comments and encouraging people to join the JSS/US. You and other will be pleased to know that the very useful sword literature index that Gray Doffin put together a number of years ago has been updated and is now available for everyone's use by going to jssus.org and clicking on the SLI link. This is now a searchable index and (if memory serves correctly) has been added to the JSS/US web site as a public service. Check it out...<br/>

  Hello All,<br/>
<br/>
  Just a quick note of appreciation to the JSSUS for providing such good information (for this forever nubie) through their membership.  2008 was the first time I had belonged.  I just renewed for 2009.  For those who don't currently belong, I would urge you to strongly consider springing for a membership.  It is well worth the reasonable dues.  Calls 'em as I sees 'em.<br/>
<br/>
  Best Regards,<br/>
  Gary Gabelhouse<br/>
