<br/>
Very interesting tsuba.  I do not think I have ever seen one like it.  Not the design or the unusually shaped large kozuka hitsu.  Sort of like some of the early Jingo but different.<br/>
<br/>
The shape of the nakago ana is also unusual in that it does not have the shape you would expect to see that would tightly fit a nakago, and I think it would be difficult to fit a seppa without covering the sukashi design.<br/>
<br/>
The look of the iron on the plate seems a little coarser and I do not see any of the large bones in the surface of the plate.  Its hard to tell from pictures though.  The hoan tsuba I have handled have been abut 1.2 to 1.3mm thick.<br/>
<br/>
Very interesting unusual tsuba.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-155401157">Hi John, thanks for those comments, yes it's pretty rustic, LOL, good <br/>
word that, it covers sooo much. My description should have said 2.3mm <br/>
thick. Wow, 1.3 mm would be a very thin tsuba, more decorative that <br/>
practical ????. I don't think there are any bones, I need to take better <br/>
pics, when the sun returns I will attempt it. I am also curious about <br/>
the wheel motif, if it is ?, all the wheel tsuba I have are either <br/>
round, or a round wheel in another shape, but the wheel itself is always <br/>
round. I wonder if this is something else I cannot see.<br/>
