Are you talking about taking an antique sword and cutting a groove in it? I<br/>
hope not. There is no one I know of in Japan who would do that. And I think<br/>
you would be hard pressed to find someone who would even do it to a newly<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1978966185">Thanks Alan,<br/>
I bought the blade in shirasaia storage mount. I plan to add furniture <br/>
to it and use it to practice. Its a little over 2.45 shaku in <br/>
length..... perfect size for me. I was surprised at the length, I didn't <br/>
think too many were made to that length, especially in the middle 1600. <br/>
Adding a groove would lighten it and add sound to the cuts. I know <br/>
someone that sent a koto blade to Japan to have a bo-hi put on. They did <br/>
a beautiful job, several collectors have seen it and said that it did <br/>
not detract from the beauty of the sword. As I said in previous <br/>
responses I don't plan to ruin the sword and if I will do it it will be <br/>
sent to Japan to an expert.<br/>

I want to second Gordon's advice. I would urge you not to alter your  sword<br/>
in the way you are describing. If you want a grooved blade order one or<br/>
find one. At the very least you should not do anything until you have had<br/>
your blade well shinsa'd.<br/>
Still, your question does point up a basic feature of the world of<br/>
nippon-to. The values and standards of the various people involved in<br/>
Japanese swords are diverse. What is absolutely "wrong" to some is "just<br/>
fine" to others. Most of us base our actions on our views of aesthetics and<br/>
a sense of historical preservation. There are other values out there and<br/>
knowing that helps to understand some of the things we see about swords.<br/>
When I was first in Japan I happened to meet a number of sword craftsmen<br/>
rather than collectors. Of course this was interesting (heck, it was<br/>
wonderful), but it may have given me a skewed view.<br/>
1. The first "smith" I met ( and he was an important artist-and a<br/>
wonderful person) was re-tempering some old swords when I visited his<br/>
forge.<br/>
2.  An important kinko proudly showed me his portfolio that included some<br/>
very excellent "umegane" work he had done. He assured me that "no one could<br/>
see" the fillings he had put into some seriously flawed blades.<br/>
3. During a road trip with a fellow who had recently completed his<br/>
polishing apprenticeship, we took a long extra trip to let his teacher see<br/>
the grooves he was carving on a tanto. He was proud of his work and his<br/>
master approved. When I asked why he was doing it, he said "the smith<br/>
should have put the grooves in."<br/>
These men are not crooks or villains. Indeed, I think they are great<br/>
artists and skilled students, but they operate with a different set of<br/>
values.<br/>
You certainly can find craftsmen who will do what you ask of them, but one<br/>
thing is clear. You will only be able to cut grooves in your sword once. I<br/>
urge you to proceed with caution.<br/>

Are you talking about taking an antique sword and cutting a groove in it? I<br/>
hope not. There is no one I know of in Japan who would do that. And I think<br/>
you would be hard pressed to find someone who would even do it to a newly<br/>

not seen as a good thing.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes and no.  It was originally made to be used.  If it survives a<br/>
certain passage of time, and if of sufficient quality to begin with,<br/>
its primary identity passes from "tool" to "art object".  One might<br/>
quibble over what this time might be.  In my opinion, any good nihonto<br/>
over 100 years old has earned its retirement and shouldn't be messed<br/>
with or put at any substantial risk.  Others may disagree, but as<br/>
strongly as I (and I suspect others) feel about this, and as is<br/>
typical of conflicting basic values, discussion is prone to get very<br/>
heated very quickly, and is not something I desire to pursue beyond<br/>
this stated opinion.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-937239389">Hello Enore, To place bohi to lighten an old sword means the sword is <br/>
too heavy for you. It was done often with conversion of tachi to <br/>
uchigatana or katana, to balance the sword. Hearing about the koto <br/>
being carved makes me shudder. To carve bohi for better whistling <br/>
sounds is a shallow reason to alter something that can not be undone. <br/>
You will never use this sword for what it was intended (battle) so <br/>
use an iaito with any horimono you wish to make whistles and leave <br/>
historical irreplaceable objects alone. John<br/>

<h3>Re: Bo-hi</h3>
by <i>peonies_waves</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1520072560">Hello Enore,<br/>
<br/>
A few more thoughts to consider. If your sword is a shinto sword, it <br/>
was almost for certain carried by a samurai. The question then <br/>
becomes, if this sword was good enough for a real samurai without a <br/>
bo-hi, how is it that it is suddenly not good enough without a bo-hi <br/>
now? <br/>
<br/>
Additionally, isn't cutting a 'striking event', and if it is, isn't <br/>
final momentum a critical factor in addition to cutting motion? And, <br/>
isn't momentum made up of mass X velocity? Therefore, by removing <br/>
metal for a bo-hi won't that reduce the mass, thereby reduce the <br/>
striking force of the cut? While you could possibly increase the <br/>
velocity with a lighter sword to compensate some, the best result <br/>
would come from a combination of both.<br/>
<br/>
Historically, the reason for bo-hi is to reduce battle fatigue <br/>
(lactic acid build up) from making cut after cut for an extended <br/>
period of time. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1870312338">PS rereading there is one additional point of some importance, and <br/>
that is, it just so happens that those appreciation points of beauty <br/>
go hand in hand with precisely what makes a great cutting sword, a <br/>
great cutting sword. The fact that you do not understand this is your <br/>
loss.<br/>
<br/>
Please don't misunderstand, i'm not knocking cutting by any means! In <br/>
fact complete sword appreciation would require both, study and cut.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1358104645">Its a Shinto blade not Koto. If I do put the hi on it will not be for <br/>
whistling purposes. What makes people think that I would shallowly ruin <br/>
an old blade. I see no reason why the blade cannot be used for Iaido and <br/>
adding a hi on it does not ruin the blade, if done by a proper smith in <br/>
Japan. The blade can still be appreciated. We are obviously looking at <br/>
this from opposite ends. If done correctly and I presented you with the <br/>
blade for the first time you would probably not know that it was modified.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1609565730">Enore, I think you will find this may be the wrong place to ask this <br/>
question. You would be better off going to Bugei forum or International <br/>
Sword Forum and asking. The members here are true conservationists and <br/>
what you are suggest is grating on many nerves. This is not something <br/>
that is offered in this day and age as a rule, as Mr Robson has noted it <br/>
is not really done by the top togi in Japan. Most Hi are polished out <br/>
over time and eventually almost disappear.<br/>
<br/>
Don't feel you are being attacked personally. it is just that most true <br/>
Nihontophiles consider this a blasphemy of sorts.<br/>

	Your passion for authentic practice is comendable. Your teacher it  <br/>
seems has done something similar in pursuit of her idea of perfect  <br/>
form. Most anyone here would not put in a bohi for practice or to  <br/>
remove a flaw without serious study and long consideration. A skilled  <br/>
man could probably put in a hi that was difficult to detect as ato- <br/>
bori. However many of us here have seen good hi cut on old swords and  <br/>
have learned to look for them as a sign of age or worse; hidden  <br/>
flaws. If the sword came in shirasaya someone thought enough of it to  <br/>
try to preserve it as is.<br/>
	You asked for opinions and we would recommend that you not alter the  <br/>
sword without more study, more study of swords, and more study of  <br/>
swordsmanship. Batto-do is destructive no matter how good the  <br/>
swordsman one should never cut with antique swords. Iaido believe it  <br/>
or not is destructive, constant practice dulls blades, scuffs  <br/>
polishes and eats up koshirae. Trust me I know. Restoring a sword  <br/>
that has been practised with can be a tricky process, one where fatal  <br/>
flaws may come to light. Someone restored it once, polished it once  <br/>
and put it in shirasaya for protection once, long ago. The hand of  <br/>
our elders is apparent in that saya listen to what it is telling you.<br/>
	In two years time you may find you prefer a longer sword or a  <br/>
heavier sword or one with deeper curve. Some folks take ten years or  <br/>
more before they settle on the style of blade that best suits their  <br/>
practise. Practise hard but proceed with caution you'll be glad you did.<br/>

As pointed out in other posts, this is not a personal attack, but you<br/>
did ask for opinions and I think they have been unanimous. <br/>
If you need a blade for cutting, then why not commision a modern<br/>
shinsakuto made to your specifications?<br/>
These swords were made that way for a reason, and I feel that saying<br/>
it would be better with a hi, is like saying that you think a Picasso<br/>
needs more red, and then considering adding it.  Even if it would be<br/>
better..it is not how the artist intended it to be. The swords were<br/>
once made for battle...but now they are universally considered art. <br/>
We collectors are always striving to get swords that are as close as<br/>
possible to how they were originally  manufactured. Yes...suriage is<br/>
tolerated...but not prefered. It is accepted because it cannot be<br/>
undone. No-one here would have an old sword shortened because they<br/>
think it would look better that way. <br/>
Adding hi may not be noticable, but it is not the chosen action by<br/>
anyone except yourself..and since we are preserving these swords for<br/>
future generations...I just feel it is selfish to change it. The next<br/>
generation may want it shortened..the next will add a horimono..and<br/>
after a few generations what was a nice Shinto sword becomes another<br/>
back-of-the-cupboard relic. None of this can be undone, and the fact<br/>
that others may do it does not make it the correct action.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi Enore,<br/>
<br/>
I rarely post here, but your message makes me feel obliged to respond.<br/>
<br/>
I can agree (to some extent) with an opinion that swords were made to <br/>
be used rather than for appreciation only. However, as you seem to <br/>
practice sword arts, think about that: various ancient swordsmanship <br/>
schools, methods, techniques were also created for active use <br/>
(particularly - in battle), not for any sort of appreciation or <br/>
samurai-style fitness exercises. However it is considered a horrible <br/>
misconduct (among serious practitioners) to change the authentic <br/>
techniques for a reason of 'adapting it for oneself' or even thinking <br/>
that 'certain technique is meant to be this way, not the way old <br/>
teachers were doing it (for centuries)'. I would say this principle <br/>
can well be applied to old swords: while created to be used, they are <br/>
not for change (unless in damaged condition) or unless your skills <br/>
become equal or higher than skills of old masters.<br/>
<br/>
Practice sword supplies are plentiful at the moment. You may even <br/>
order one to be made _exactly_ how you want it to be. I would agree <br/>
with others: please please please leave the sword unchanged. If it's <br/>
too heavy/too long/too short - it's just not for you (for your <br/>
practice). If you feel like training with old nihonto (to be frank I <br/>
don't support this idea and neither did different sensei I met), find <br/>
the sword which fits your hands as is, without change. I personally <br/>
do sometimes unsheath one of my swords to do a couple of slow cuts in <br/>
the air to 'get this feeling back' ;-) But I would never consider <br/>
using it on a regular basis (or any basis) in training - well made <br/>
iaito is enough.<br/>
<br/>
Another reason it's not recommended is safety. Regardless how well <br/>
preserved it looks, you simply don't know the history of this sword. <br/>
As somebody mentioned earlier it could have been treated with <br/>
some 'cosmetic surgery' or even just have a natural flaw which didn't <br/>
appear (yet) because the sword was _never_ used. By the way, adding <br/>
bo-hi would only increase that risk.<br/>
<br/>
Kind Regards,<br/>

addition, one of the most outstanding examples of Japan's traditon of <br/>
highly skilled craftsmanship.  The tireless efforts of hereditary <br/>
artisans, who's sole efforts in life was the achievement of perfection <br/>
in their craft, the Samurai sword is indeed a beautiful work of art as <br/>
well as a formidable weapon."<br/>
<br/>
Your Shin-to sword may very well be as much as 400 yrs. old.  It has <br/>
remained just as the Swordsmith intended it to be through "Many" <br/>
owners.  All of whom did not feel the need to alter it.  Yes, you are <br/>
the present owner, to do with it as you wish.  However, "All" of us <br/>
are only temporary "Custodian's" of these artifacts.  I would <br/>
encourage you leave it "as is."  Allow the many future owners to study <br/>
and enjoy it in original unalterd form. <br/>
<br/>
I myself am even reluctant to have a sword polished which could be <br/>
considered "sorely in need."  The two deflected blade marks in the <br/>
mune would be gone.  The two "knicks" in the ha which may have been <br/>
retaliatory strokes would also be gone.....<br/>
<br/>
Good luck,<br/>

�������������������� By "stepping on the nest", you were looking for<br/>
opinions right? And opinions are what you got. From what I've read, you<br/>
received some great advice from complete strangers who care just as much<br/>
about your blade as you do. Now, with all this information you got, you'll<br/>
need to sit back, reflect and ask youself  some hard questions. Just because<br/>
all these e-mails don't necessarily support your wishes, you can't ignore<br/>
the wealth of experience that has gone into each and every one of those<br/>
opinions.<br/>
Give the blade the honor it deserves and think long and hard on this.<br/>
Continue to ask "knowledgable" people what they think. Study, learn, study<br/>
some more.<br/>
