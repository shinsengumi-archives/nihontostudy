<h3>Hizen tsuba motif questions</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1436674337">Hi All -<br/>
<br/>
A recent purchase has me very interested in finding out the names of subjects on a Hizen tsuba that I've shown under Yahoo Photos in my file Ron STL. After digging through my books I've come up with more questions than answers. <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I'm particularly interested in what looks like an "angel" on the front side. I also see a "jewel/tama" in upper-right corner and the peacock and "table." <br/>
<br/>
The backside shows a "stone lantern" and the "dragon." <br/>
<br/>
On the edge of the tsuba are gold nunome vines and "clouds" (ura side) and on the frontside, more "clouds" and what I believe are a form of "dragon"...perhaps the "water dragon." <br/>
<br/>
I've located a similar signed tsuba illustrated in Fukunaga's "Hizen no Katana to Tsuba" vol. 2, p.317. Unfortunately, I can't read the detail about this illustration other than it confirms (to my satisfaction) that this is a Hizen tsuba. <br/>
<br/>
Regarding the design used on the tsuba's edge (omote side), the book "Tsuba" by H.U.B. Verlag (?) that Haynes was involved in a number of years ago show a similar edge decoration, but there it is called simply "tendrils." I think this is wrong, that is is a form of dragon. <br/>
<br/>
Anyone out there familiar enough with these designs to shed some light on their names/meanings? I find this a rather fascinating tsuba and the "namban" influence it has. <br/>
