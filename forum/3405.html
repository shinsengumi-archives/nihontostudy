<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Just wanted to pass this along to those of you coming to Tokyo at the end of<br/>
this month for the Dai-Token Ichi. The NTHK will hold its annual big sword<br/>
appreciation meeting on October 30th from 1 pm at our regular meeting place<br/>
near Shinanomachi. The theme is famous Koto and koshirae. There is a 5,000<br/>
yen fee for attendance. Anyone who wants to attend, but does not know how to<br/>
get there can meet in front of Shinanomachi station at around one and I will<br/>
be happy to guide you. Hope to see many of you soon. Also, as in the past,<br/>
if everyone wants to get together for Saturday night dinner and drinks, let<br/>
me know and I will get a reservation made.<br/>

 Would love to be there but Japan is getting skipped this year as we are to move to Georgia, near Atlanta within days, and you can imagine the work involved. Please let me know if and when the Dutch shinsa will take place. Regards, Arnold<br/>

Going to where the magnolias grow, eh. Had enough of the frozen tundra? <br/>
Sounds like a bit pain in the neck. I will miss seeing you, and no word <br/>
on weather a Dutch thing is happening. It looks very slim at this <br/>
point.<br/>
