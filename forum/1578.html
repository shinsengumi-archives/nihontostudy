<h3>The front and back of things</h3>
by <i>retalt</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-628852565">All, recently I got to thinking about distinguishing between the front and back of a tsuba with a pattern that is identical on both sides. <br/>
On the image of the Akao tsuba supplied, there is no difference in the design regardless of which side we look at it from. The only difference is the punch marks that have been added when fitted to a sword. <br/>
<br/>
Is this an indication ? were these always facing the tsuka for example, or perhaps towards the habaki. Is there anyway to tell front form back, or does it not matter. <br/>
<br/>
Cheers <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-345464756">Agreed on the punches almost always being on the front side (facing the<br/>
tsuka).  Not much clue from the hitsu-ana on Rich's piece due to the<br/>
symmetry.<br/>

Punches and other such things are always on the front. Also, there are<br/>
