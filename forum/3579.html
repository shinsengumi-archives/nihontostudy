<div id="ygrps-yiv-1661486589">Hey guys,<br/>
<br/>
I'm looking at buying a gendaito that I wanted to use as a piece to <br/>
leave out to show people/use for<br/>
photography research, and am<br/>
currently looking at buying a piece that appears to have a Nakirishimei <br/>
(its a laydown for a<br/>
1 million yen rated smith in Slough's book - it doesn't have one of the <br/>
two "hot stamps" in his example, but...).<br/>
<br/>
My first question is what do you think of "validity" of this type of mei <br/>
versus one that actually got signed by the<br/>
smith himself?  will these end up just getting attributed to the <br/>
appropriate smiths eventually (kinda like the<br/>
tadayoshi problem on steroids), or are these treated gimei, or...? <br/>
 Second, has anybody run into these where<br/>
the wrong mei got put on the sword?  And finally, this piece wasn't <br/>
dated, but has no arsenal stamps - should<br/>
I be worried that this is one of those pieces described in Kapp's where <br/>
they manage to get a nice hizenish<br/>
hada/nie by careful treatment of modern materials?<br/>
<br/>
Any comments would be greatly appreciated.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
<br/>
