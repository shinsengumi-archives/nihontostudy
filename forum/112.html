<div id="ygrps-yiv-1952447937">Hi. The most common theory as to why there is such a high incidence of<br/>

never found that to be a very good answer as they were, after all,<br/>
patronized by a major Daimyo and Hizen, as a major trading center, both as<br/>
an entrepot and as a ceramic producer, and large koku domain, could hardly<br/>
have been poor. I have no basis whatsoever for this but I wonder if the<br/>
answer might lie in their choice to make blades with a relatively larger,<br/>
in a cross section sense, core steel. That would make the blade more<br/>
flexible. Do any of you who are up on the construction part of swords find<br/>
this makes sense from a functional point of view? <br/>
 It is interesting to note that in the Chicago display of Rai blades last<br/>

<br/>
It's so good to hear from you, Arnold.  I appreciate your delving <br/>
through the massive week's input to nihonto ramblings and picking the <br/>
wheat from the chaff.  I hope I don't pop a bubble here, but <br/>
re "flexibility", the thickness of the kawagane vs. the shingane <br/>
doesn't make any difference from a metallurgical viewpoint.  It is <br/>
perhaps surprising that all iron and steels have the same Young's <br/>
modulus (ratio of strain to stress in the elastic region).  This is <br/>
perhaps amazing, in that, say, low carbon steel (as in shingane) is <br/>
mostly pearlite embedded in body centered cubic iron matrix, whereas <br/>
quench hardened kawagane and hagane is mostly acicular needles of <br/>
martensite, body centered tetragonal unit cell.  And yet (to me, <br/>
counterintuitively), the Youngs moduli are the same.  For the same <br/>
elastic stress, the same elastic strain (bending) results.  Now, this <br/>
applies only up to the elastic limit in the gross sense.  That is, at <br/>
a certain point, soft steel will permanently bend at a lower applied <br/>
stress than a hard steel.  But as long as neither's elastic limit is <br/>
exceeded, the "flexibility" is identical.  As a personal note, I have <br/>
read supposed old Japanese comments that western swords are "too <br/>
flexible".  Again, this makes no sense below the elastic limit.  All <br/>
iron and steel acts the same below the elastic limit.  The difference <br/>
is that, at a certain stress, Japanese blades will permanently bend, <br/>
whereas the overall harder European blades will not.  Then again, the <br/>
European blades may be more prone to brittle fracture.  But this very <br/>
much depends on the quality of the individual Japanese and European <br/>
blades being compared.  But, in general, European swords are no <br/>
more "flexible" than Japanese blades, and no Japanese swords are <br/>
more "flexible" than any others; it only depends (roughly) on the <br/>
cross-section vs. length, up to the point the blades are permanently <br/>
bent.  And, generally, Japanese blades (hard edge, soft core) will <br/>
permanently bend before European swords (spring steel throughout) <br/>
will (but, then again, maybe not fracture).<br/>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-581326863">Wow!! It is more than sobering to learn what I don't know about the<br/>
metallurgical end of things. I have read it twice and if I understand you<br/>
correctly you are saying that for a given cross-sectional profile and for<br/>
two blades of the same length and curvature, that the application of the<br/>
same stress, say from a force perpendicular to the axis of the blades,<br/>
and within the confines of their elastic limit, the "performance" of a<br/>
blade made entirely of shingane would be the same as a blade made entirely<br/>
from kawagane. Is that correct?  You are getting no argument from me; I<br/>
just want to see if I understand.<br/>
To go on for a bit, if the elastic limit of core steel is reached sooner -<br/>
for a given stress - then I suppose shingane performs no function other<br/>
than to reduce production cost, and were it not for that reason a blade<br/>
would be made entirely of kawagane in that its elastic limit is reached<br/>
later and it is, of course, more capable of holding an edge - or is that<br/>
an incorrect inference?<br/>
 Just curious.<br/>

Yup, believe it or not, the modulus of elasticity is approximately <br/>
the same for all steels.  Amazing, but true.  Here's a quote from <br/>
Physical Metallurgy For Engineers (Clark & Varney, 1962), p.198:<br/>
<br/>
"Sometimes stiffness of a part is an important consideration.  For <br/>
this requirement, aloy steels do not offer any advantages over the <br/>
plain carbon steels.  Stiffness is determined by the modulus of <br/>
elasticity or the relationship between the stress and the strain <br/>
within the elastic limit.  An alloy steel may have a higher elastic <br/>
limit than a plain carbon steel, but the modulus of elasticity will <br/>
be the same, regardless of heat treatment.  The solution to stiffness <br/>
problems (ed. - no dirty cracks from Das Klub!), when steel is <br/>
demanded, is one of design and not metallurgy."<br/>
<br/>
So as far as limiting "flexibility", the soft core does nothing.  I'm <br/>
guessing it's mostly a cost consideration (at least in the old days, <br/>
just a carried over tradition nowadays).  Of course, there might be <br/>
other considerations.  Perhaps a low carbon steel core (pearlite in a <br/>
ferritic matrix) as compared to an unhardened medium carbon steel <br/>
core (mostly pearlite) exhibits greater resistance to crack <br/>
propagation and resultant brittle fracture.  I kinda doubt it, but <br/>
it's a possibility.  Given the very clean traditional tamahagane, I <br/>
imagine the Reference Transformation Temperature (temp below which <br/>
the steel behaves brittly) is below zero degrees F for unhardened <br/>
hagane and kawagane (of course, hardened hagane is quite brittle at <br/>
normal room temp).  <br/>
<br/>
I have discussed this sword construction consideration with amateur <br/>
US smiths, some of whom skip the soft core insertion, and just fold <br/>
forge the blade from the same medium carbon steel throughout, and <br/>
maintain the result is better than the traditional alternative, since <br/>
using hagane throughout will yield a sword more resistant to bending <br/>
due the the higher yield strength of an unhardened medium carbon <br/>
steel core as compared to an unhardened low carbon steel core.<br/>
<br/>
So the comments of the Japanese abroad that western swords are "too <br/>
flexible" ring hollow.  If such were indeed the case, it was due to <br/>
geometry (as ratio of length to cross sectional thickness), not due <br/>
to the difference in the steels.  Class closed, test tomorrow!<br/>

Much of what NC and Arnold have discussed about metallurgy is beyond me,<br/>

students (and I)  published a small paper calling attention to the residual<br/>
stresses within Japanese swords. Bill's insights was that strong<br/>
compressive pressure on the hamon contributed to - indeed, allowed - the<br/>
martensite of the edge to withstand the abuse of a swung sword. I think<br/>
this is NOT entirely germane to the point the NC is making, but Bill argued<br/>
that a factor that contributed to the ability to set up the compressive<br/>
tension was the fact that nippon-to are in essence composite structures.<br/>
That is, they are combination of different orders of steel heightens a<br/>

the development of the multi-part cross sections.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1811057281">Peter (and Folk) -<br/>
<br/>
You are correct re the compressive residual stress inside a nihonto <br/>
ha, which allows the very brittle martensite to survive the quench <br/>
hardening process (well, usually).  However, this residual <br/>
compressive stress is enhanced by the relative expansion of the <br/>
martensitic ha as compared to the ferritic/pearlitic core, but is not <br/>
fundamentally caused by it.  Due to the much more rapid cooling of <br/>
the ha, there would be a residual compressive stress left in it even <br/>
were there no phase transformations at all, such as in a uniform <br/>
austenitic nickel steel.  I am dubious, however, as to how much this <br/>
residual compressive stress adds to the longevity of the ha in battle <br/>
use.  Imagine the brittle ha under compression like a string of, say, <br/>
20 child's wooden blocks squeezed between your hands.  Push really <br/>
hard!  Now have someone tap the middle block from one side, and watch <br/>
the blocks spray out.  And so I've seen nihonto with big chips blown <br/>
out of the ha, perhaps likewise ejected by an off-center, sideways <br/>
strike to the ha by something hard.  In any event, I don't think any <br/>
of the following has any effect on the "flexibility" issue, the <br/>
elastic bending of the sword below the yield stress or brittle <br/>
fracture stress.  Again, "flexibility" of an iron/steel sword does <br/>
not depend on carbon/alloy content or heat treatment.  Not intuitive <br/>
at all to me.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, I obviously forgot which list I was on in a previous reply, and <br/>
so apologize.  Also, the elastic modulus (Young's modulus) is, of <br/>
course, the ratio of the stress to the strain, not the reverse as I <br/>
erroneously said before.  If you maintain the units, any error <br/>
becomes obvious.  That is why physicists rarely have a problem, <br/>
whereas engineers tend to get into trouble, crashing space probes <br/>
into planets and whatnot.  ;o)<br/>

<h3>Laminations</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-797769588">Hi.<br/>
 Very interesting. Why not write up a piece for the JSS/US NL as it should<br/>
at the very least be provocative. Can it be that the much honored view<br/>
that have been handed down on the gains from lamination are really mostly<br/>
myth and that a simple economic explanation lies at the heart of the main<br/>
category of lamination, ie, core and sheathing steel combinations?<br/>
 Anyway, thanks for the seminar so far.<br/>

Well, heck, I should have just kept my mouth shut. I think I would have a<br/>
bit of a problem putting my hand on my copy of the paper and I just<br/>
discovered that the great state University of Nebraska doesn't even have a<br/>
copy(! Go Huskers). Here is what they say about the ref.<br/>

I imagine that a serious engineering school library would have a copy or<br/>
you could get on via interlibrary loan. For the record, I doubt that this<br/>
is the best source of metalographic insight into nippon-to. I think it has<br/>
more on residual stresses than other sources, but if you have not read (or<br/>
re-reread!) Cyril Stanley Smith's History of Metalography, I suspect it<br/>
will be of greater use. This is also another opportunity for me to<br/>
recommend the great book on Iron by Rostoker and Ben Bronson. I love that<br/>
book<br/>
