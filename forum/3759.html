<div id="ygrps-yiv-1737220178">Hello<br/>
<br/>
(Not a "real" nihonto quest , but i try anyway.)<br/>
<br/>
I bought this pieces from a guy that bought this at EBAY for a couple of years ago, he paid alot for it, he didnt notice that it had a "wooden" blade in it......he thought that it was a complete sword....but anyway i bought it from him for a couple of $ now.<br/>
<br/>
My question is, what are the "marking" on the top of the Tsuka?? and all of the parts has the same "sign" on them, can someone translate them?, and WHY are they sign??? On my other Gunto mountings there is no signs on any of the kosihrae parts.<br/>
<br/>
(i tried to fill in the signs on one of the photos)<br/>

<br/>
Believe me mate, yours IS a real Nihonto question IMHO.  The "badge" on the top<br/>
of the handle fitting (kabutogane) is a mon - a family crest, and a very nicely<br/>
made one.  These may or may not be real (in the "family" sense) but I won't talk<br/>
about that now.  They are fairly often found and usually regarded as a "good<br/>
sign" of a better class blade in the mounting.  Yours is one of the so-called<br/>
Genji mon, I believe, a symbol from history - perhaps someone knows more about<br/>
them.  Hawley produced a sheet of all the symbols and I've probably still got<br/>
mine around somewhere (40 years of detrtitus hanging around my neck!!!)<br/>
<br/>
The writing on the wooden part of the tsuka is I believe the signature of the<br/>
man who made the handle.  Whilst unusual such signatures are sometimes found.<br/>
To me they indicate a custom-made tsuka by an artisan and not a regular "factory<br/>
job".  Your signature has all the appearances of being "enhanced" by someone<br/>
with a felt pen, which is a real pity.  Some of these signatures I have found<br/>
are of excellent calligraphy.  I believe there were a few families of note who<br/>
were handle binders by profession and were involved in creating better class<br/>
gunto koshirae.  Your tsuka is one of the best-looking and best condition tsuka<br/>
I have ever seen.  Like new - the silk still has a sheen. You are fortunate, so<br/>
help to preserve it by only handling the tsuka with cotton gloves to avoid<br/>
soiling the silk.<br/>
<br/>
The scratchy signatures on the metal parts are probably those of the owner and I<br/>
never pay them any attention as without other documentation it is near<br/>
impossible to find who the owner was..<br/>
<br/>
The wooden blade indicates either (a) that a former owner polished the blade and<br/>
put it into shirasaya and had a tsunagi (wooden blade) made for the koshirae.  I<br/>
have done this for a Tadahiro II katana I had polished.  Or (b) that a previous<br/>
owner made his own tsunagi and simply sold off the blade...<br/>
<br/>
Best regards,<br/>
