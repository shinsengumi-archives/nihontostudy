<h3>Satsuma tsuba question</h3>

I was recently asked what would seem a rather simple<br/>
question: "What do you think this tsuba is worth?"<br/>
<br/>
Usually that is a simple question that I'll give my<br/>
2cent answer to if I have any degree of fair<br/>
confidence in my answer through what I have observed<br/>
here or there over the years.<br/>
<br/>
In this instance, it was a very nice iron Satsuma<br/>
tsuba with some gold nunome vines and the Shimizu<br/>
(sp?) mon on it. Practically straight out of the<br/>
Satsuma koshirae book.<br/>
<br/>
The tsuba didn't knock my socks off, but was a good<br/>
tsuba a bit afield from what I collect. Interesting<br/>
piece.<br/>
   I realized then that either I have overlooked any<br/>
nicer Satsuma tsuba on the market, or maybe they<br/>
simply don't come to market that often? Anyone able to<br/>
point me at some Satsuma tsuba in Japan or give me a<br/>
fair ballpark what sort of value they carry in Japan?<br/>
I'd love to see other examples, if anyone has photos.<br/>
I haven't much looked for them before, but now am a<br/>
little more curious to learn about them.<br/>
