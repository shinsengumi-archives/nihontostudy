<h3>Nagamaki kosherai</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1500808">First, I want to thank Jim for posting these pictures for me!  i just <br/>
figured out how to get signed on! {:)  As I mentioned to Jim, the <br/>
miscellaneous attachments on this section of pole (14 inches long) in <br/>
my opinion are all functional.  I believe as Jim mentioned that the <br/>
barbs on the "quadraspike" (how's that for a word!) are for breaking <br/>
the blade of an opponent.  I also think that the tightly woven fiber <br/>
bands on both sides of it would act as shock absorbers..they would <br/>
flex under impact and then spring back to their original position.  I <br/>
imagine the impact of a blade against another weapon would be <br/>
considerable.  I think also that with this heavy a blade, the pole <br/>
would need quite a bit of reinforcement and all these fittings would <br/>
definately supply that.  I believe the section behind the large tsuba <br/>
would have had same' panels and tsukamaki wrap for the left (forward) <br/>
hand.  This nagamaki is very plain in all respects and in my opinion <br/>
is probably a Shinshinto copy of an older fighting piece not some <br/>
late ceremonial decoration.  The Shinshinto period was a time <br/>
of "experimental archaeology" in that the Japanese were trying to <br/>
rediscover their earlier sword making styles and abilities and I <br/>
think this may be one outcome of that study.<br/>
