<br/>
This is going to sound like a somewhat unusual question, but it is one <br/>
that I am often asked, and am unable to answer, so I need some expert <br/>
input.<br/>
<br/>
I have noted that symmetrically design swords such as some European <br/>
forms, "sing" with a clear ringing tone  when impacted, even when done <br/>
gently, and that asymmetrical ones like reproduction Nihonto such as <br/>
Iaito do not. Instead these replicas produce a flat "clat" like note.<br/>
<br/>
I have for some time presumed that this was due to their asymmetry, <br/>
however, could this be due to these weapons lack of hardness<br/>
<br/>
Therefore can you clarify if Japanese swords do "sing" if struck?<br/>
<br/>
Any help would be most warmly received.<br/>
<br/>
With much thanks<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
wakizashi blade with (kiku-mon) iga no kami fujiwara kinmichi signature removed from mounts, suspended on a rubber band, tapped gently on the tang with a coin emits a clear note which lasts for about 2 seconds that is the C above middle C ( checked against notes on a piano by my wife). The blade is not perfect - a few forging flaws - but probably dates from about 1650.<br/>
<br/>
I could repeat this with some modern swords if you like but the iato you tried may not be steel<br/>
<br/>
Hopes that this helps<br/>
