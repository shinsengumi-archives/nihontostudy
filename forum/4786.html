<div id="ygrps-yiv-870251542">I'm taking this sword to the Arms show in Dallas next weekend to have it disassembled by someone that knows what they are doing - I'd probably destroy any value it might have - the handle seems fragile.  I have yet to see if the blade is signed, but figure it is and need to know the swordsmith before I know if it is junk or not.  While apart I will photo the tsuba and post pictures.  The tsuba is loose right now to the extent that I can see that it is signed, but of coures the symbol is undecipherable to me - it is a single charater and I can't photo it due to the angle right now.  All I know right now about this sword is that my one of my Husband's relatives, who was a marine in WWII, got it on Okinawa during the war.  It is obviously not a WWII era sword and hence the mystery and intrigue.<br/>

I posted a scan in your folder. It should answer most<br/>
of your question. According to Gary Murtha's Sword<br/>
Fittings book pg 44, it is probably a tsuba by Kyoto<br/>
Kiyonori or one of his students.<br/>
<br/>
I've seen this tsuba a few times over the years. If<br/>
you (carefully) remove the pin holding on the tsuka<br/>
and look at the face of the tsuba that was under the<br/>
tsuka, you will (maybe 50/50 %) see a gold 'KAO' mark<br/>
like that on the tsuba images uploaded to your folder.<br/>
The Kao will probably allow us to attribute it to a<br/>
specific person, althought the KAO shown by Murtha and<br/>
that recorded by Haynes are somewhat different for<br/>
these guys. Still, we should have a good idea.<br/>
<br/>
According to Murtha, Kiyonori was "A Kyoto artist.<br/>
Signed with gold inlaid kao. His favorite design being<br/>
crickets in grass. One of his students was Atsuiye who<br/>
changed his name to Noriiye."<br/>
<br/>
They are nice tsubas. One of the fellow listmembers<br/>
had one a few years back. If he sold it, he could<br/>
probably tell you the value best.<br/>
   I did not look closely, but do the fuchi-kashira<br/>
match the tsuba in design? That would be nice.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-764712379">Wow, I can't  believe it.  The scan you put in my folder.  The one top left is identical to mine.  Same crickets. And the signature is identical to the one someone posted as a mino.  So now I know about the tsuba.  So what about the sword?  Is the maker of the sword and the tsuba generally completely different people?  schools?  are they totally disassociated or might there be some swordsmiths that tended to use tsubas from this particular school?<br/>

Woud it be possible to get good shots of the fuchi and kashira, please???  I fancy I can see a particular pattern in them that I would like to see more clearly.  A friend has a fuchigashira that has gold inlay that looks like Persian writing.  It may simply be an imaginative, random pattern, but your pieces sort of look similar...<br/>

  I'd agree with John, Barry, and Rich. My interest is<br/>
in fittings, so I agree with Barry in that the fuchi<br/>
(and probably the kashira too) looks interesting. We'd<br/>
love to see more photographs, if possible. Just be<br/>
gentle with the tsuka (handle), but don't be afraid of<br/>
it.<br/>

The nakago (tang) of the sword isn't signed, but does<br/>

No, the fuchigashira aren't what I thought they might be.  They are stylised clouds with possibly a highly abstract cloud dragon around the centre of the fuchi.  It isn't clear enough to see.  I think these are quite nice and have a Higo look to them???<br/>

  Happy New Year!<br/>
  I'd agree with John, Barry, and Rich. My interest is<br/>
  in fittings, so I agree with Barry in that the fuchi<br/>
  (and probably the kashira too) looks interesting. We'd<br/>
  love to see more photographs, if possible. Just be<br/>
  gentle with the tsuka (handle), but don't be afraid of<br/>
  it.<br/>
<br/>
  The nakago (tang) of the sword isn't signed, but does<br/>
  hold some promise at first glance. If you can take a<br/>
  whole shot of the nakago, it would be most beneficial<br/>
  to the sword guys on the list.<br/>
  Is Harry Watson on this list? Any chance you will<br/>
  be in Dallas this year at the gunshow she mentioned?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1540273230">Ahhhhh - I hate to bring an adverse view, but I didn't even go to the books because that " V " mark is the most un-Japanese mark I have ever seen on a nakago (45 years...).  Honestly, it is very hard without the sword in hand, but that mark in the orientation shown looks like hachi or a katakana tsu (my katakana is rusty so forgive an error, but I see three strokes).  The conclusion here is that it is a Meiji or Taisho period sword, as the patina on the nakago looks "dignified" and of some age so it can't be a Showa period gunto.  All guess work, but that " V " mark is very strange indeed...<br/>

	This appears to my eye to be the katakana "SU", not likely you can  <br/>
see it unless your computer has Japanese turned on but it looks like  <br/>
this;<br/>

<br/>
	I would look for this mark on the seppa (spacers) or other fittings,  <br/>
I could be way off but suspect this is an assembly mark. Like putting  <br/>
"As, Bs and Cs" on car parts then putting all the parts marked B  <br/>
together to make one car. I think you have a Showa-to there, but  <br/>
we'll need more photos to be sure.<br/>

I would agree with Barry that your fuchi-kashira look<br/>
like late Higo work. The Higo school is a nice school,<br/>
and did good work. Their style spread and was often<br/>
copied. I too think the design is of a very stylized<br/>
dragon. It might be what is known as Edo Higo (Higo<br/>
style manufactured in Edo). The sharp shape of the<br/>
kashira is uncommon.<br/>
<br/>
On the sword, I cannot say much. It is unsigned. It<br/>
doesn't seem any of us recognize that mark. I was<br/>
hoping someone would.<br/>
   Without a signature and with the sword  blade "out<br/>
of polish" it will be hard for us to say what school<br/>
or person made the blade. Many very old blades (of<br/>
high art value) are not signed, but also many 1920s to<br/>
1945 blades (of low art value) were unsigned. Someone<br/>
with experience in assessing out of polish<br/>
"closet-finds" like yours should take a serious look<br/>
at it. You sword may be a diamond,- or it may be a<br/>
dud. Given that it has some fair fittings of older<br/>
origin (not the military issue of WW2), I would say it<br/>
has a fair chance at being a decent blade. That is no<br/>
guarantee, -just my gut feeling.<br/>
