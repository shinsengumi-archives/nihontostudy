<div id="ygrps-yiv-1301539411">Ray,<br/>
I have been looking back and forth at my catalog and the site, which has gotten me confused.  The description of lots 253 and 251 appear to be reversed.  The blade signed Kanenaga is actually in the very un-Ezo koshirae labeled 253.  That is the koshirae you linked to and it is correctly described under lot 251.  It's quite an unusual piece, but Ezo it is not.<br/>
<br/>
Since I already got into writing this, the term Ezo has been used in a couple of ways and can be confusing.  Strictly in terms of kodogu and koshirae it is usually applied today to examples like lots 225, 230 and 251/253.  There doesn't seem to be any evidence associating these kind of fittings with the Ainu.  We can talk some more about that type of kodogu if anyone is interested.  I am at least.  <br/>
<br/>
Another more common use of the term Ezo is associated with the Ainu, and there is a very distinctive type of Ainu koshirae that is usually made up of some typical "Japanese" metal fittings mixed with uniquely Ainu type saya, tsuka and sash.  Again, something for further discussion if anyone wants.<br/>
<br/>
The metal fittings of the lot you linked to are not what I think of as either Ezo or Ainu, in any usual usage.  The little loop fitting makes me think of a late toppei koshirae (the type made for wear with Western dress).  The saya decoration is very unusual, as is the kashira shape.  The tsuba and kojiri seem to be fillers.  It's a koshirae that I'd like to look into more.<br/>
<br/>
Let me know if you have more questions, since this is pretty mixed up.<br/>
Jim<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  Jim, the Ezo koshirae is very interesting to me too. Can you give <br/>
  some background on group? I had been under the misimpression that <br/>
  these pieces were Ainu...<br/>

I think that it's a legitimate Japanese koshirae, although the bare wood parts are apparently replacements to fill in the "blanks."  It'd be hard to cobble together something with such an unusual shape to the saya, tsuka and kashira.  The shape and the suspension ring remind me of toppei koshirae from Bakumatsu.  The catalog entry claims that the fittings are decorated in uttori, which if correct would suggest a much earlier date.  I can't tell from the photo whether the ring might be a later modification.  Without having seen it in person all I can do is speculate.  It's unusual enough that even after seeing it I wouldn't be surprised if I was still stuck.  <br/>
<br/>
Alan (or anyone else who might have seen it (or now owns it)), any ideas?  This is the lot illustrated as 253, but described under 251.<br/>

The mounting is strange, the fittings are very old, the kurikata and fuchi<br/>
are made of thin metal with the nanako almost worn away, the inlay looks<br/>
like uttori with a 'trench' around each piece but the gold is not worn as I<br/>

Altogether a puzzling item. There is no bare wood visible.<br/>
Regarding another tsuba, if you have Sotheby's London catalogue of 11<br/>

Thanks.  Strange indeed.  <br/>
<br/>
I don't have that catalog, can you post the image?  I think I have already seen the same thing elsewhere, though.  Apparently pieces that are just "of the school" can get Hozon kanteisho, but I don't know the specific criteria used to separate these pieces from the run-of-the-mill late copies.  If I have the specific example I can follow up on it.<br/>

the tsuba remained unsold, not surprising....... ! The NBTHK paper is<br/>
described as a "buff paper" (???)<br/>

I don't have the catalogue now so if anyone has the Sotheby's London cat<br/>
for<br/>
12 November and can post the pic for lot 27 it would be a great help.<br/>

used to separate these pieces from the run-of-the-mill late copies.  If<br/>

I agree that it looks later than the time of the "real" Soten.  I'll speculate that the quality of the material and the workmanship were sufficient for them to accept it as "of the school."  I'll ask about it when I get a chance.  <br/>
<br/>
I happened to just look at this: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.nihonto.com/rh336.html">http://www.nihonto.com/rh336.html</a> and <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.nihonto.com/rh338.html">http://www.nihonto.com/rh338.html</a><br/>

The work on the tsuba is very good but the shape seems so late, perhaps<br/>
1800-40, I'm puzzled that I have never seen anything by Soten that would<br/>
fill the gap between Soten II and this tsuba, a gap of maybe 50 or more<br/>
years. Do you agree?<br/>
