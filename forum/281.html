Cool! I assume the fabric was that stuff they sometimes use when they <br/>
lacquer things? (I had a naginata pole with what appeared<br/>
to be fabric under the lacquer once...)<br/>

This is very interesting.  I had always thought that these were made of at least 3 to 5 layers of sandwiched leather.  <br/>
<br/>
Interesting to see 2 layers.<br/>

Thanks for posting this, very interesting. Is there any chance of getting a<br/>
picture of the "four pointed iron guard device?"<br/>
<br/>
Since we're talking polearm koshirae, I put up a photo of a nagamaki tsuba<br/>
that, foolishly, I no longer own. I recall it being 3"+, very smooth<br/>
textured iron, thin but strong feeling. Jim, you saw this one a couple of<br/>
years ago when we did the Met, perhaps you have more to say about it.<br/>

Yeah it looks to me like the fabric is similar to what's seen under lacquer on wood.  I don't know much about lacquer (where's John Badenhop?), but I'd guess that it helps the adhesion of the lacquer and/or strengthens the whole structure.<br/>
<br/>
I think that this is the only two layer kawa guard I've seen, too.  I've seen up to six layers used.  The Edo period ones tend to use fewer layers than the old ones, but I have seen 3 layers used in Kamakura period kawa tsuba.<br/>
<br/>
I put up a detail lifted from the kawatsutsumi tachi koshirae on page 25 of Kajihara-san's Visual Glossary:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://tinyurl.com/d2q4">http://tinyurl.com/d2q4</a><br/>
<br/>
Those of you with the book will probably have better luck looking at that.  The kawa tsuba has delaminated like those at Oyamazumi, but the upper half is still wrapped in what looks like a cloth bag.  I'm not sure if there are any traces of lacquer remaining.  There are o-seppa.  I have no idea if the lacquer has come off, or if some of these plain kawa tachi tsuba were never lacquered.<br/>

Craig,<br/>
Thanks.  I do remember that tsuba now that I see it.  The seppa dai and nakago ana are unmistakable.  I wonder what that sukashi work was all about.  It certainly is, um, uninhibited. Interesting example.<br/>

For some reason I really do agree with you (old shinai or boken).  Any way it can be a possibility.  I am not that knowledgeable on tsuba but I have come across old tsuba that were on Boken that were lacquered and looked very similar to this one in Japan.  Perhaps it was modified?  What do you think Jim?  <br/>

kendo come into being  ? The " fencing/swordmanship " schools of Edo days used <br/>
boken, ja ? When I was training in kenjutsu many years ago ( I have since <br/>

	Kendo per se is a Meiji era development, but Kenjutsu <br/>
practice with padded armour and bamboo shinae is much older. The <br/>
fukuro-shinae, a single piece of split bamboo covered with leather, <br/>
was in use by the Yagyu school and others in the early Edo period. <br/>
Remember the discussions on Kanbun Shinto? I for one believe that <br/>
approximating the wildly popular shinae was the reason behind the <br/>
adoption of that particular sugata...<br/>

I refrained on this one, because I figured I didn't<br/>
know enough. Glad to hear Tom speak up.<br/>
<br/>
I've seen only a few examples of the early tsuba shape<br/>
I thought Jim was referring to..., but this one looked<br/>
like an old kendo shinae tsuba to me too. Similar to<br/>
ones an old teacher had on tsuba and shinae preserved<br/>
in the 'school museum' back when I was in highschool<br/>
south of Nagoya in 1989.<br/>
    Didn't the old tsuba soft metal, leather and such,<br/>
have more of a teardrop shape to their appeture?-not<br/>
the fattened out oval shape of leather shinae tsuba's<br/>
opening?<br/>

I haven't seen the koshirae for years, but based on Keith's description and what I remember, this guard is mounted on the pole (not the nakago) and would have served as a hand stop rather than a blade stop.  The iron parrying bars would have taken care of other blades.  I don't recall anything about the leather plate that would suggest that it wasn't contemporary with the rest of the mounting, but my memory of it isn't good enough to base an argument on.  There is a somewhat similar koshirae at the bottom of page 82 of Bottomley and Hopson's "Arms and Armor of the Samurai."  Scanned here for your convenience:<br/>

I suppose it's possible that someone transplanted a shinai tsuba onto the nagamaki koshirae.  But on the other hand if you set out to make a round leather guard to go on a round wooden stick, I'm not sure how one for a nagamaki pole would or should look different from one for a shinai.  Any ideas?<br/>
<br/>
If we were talking about a loose guard not associated with a koshirae, I'd agree with Mo that it's much more likely to have been from a shinai or bokken than a nagamaki.  But this one did come on a nagamaki and we have other examples of pole arms mounted like this with a hand guard on the pole and parrying bars either mounted on the nakago or on the pole.  Am I missing something?<br/>

The Hoju tsuba from the Kofun jidai have a large opening for sort of the same reason.  They were mounted on a fitting on the handle rather than on the nakago.  So, large ovoid opening rather than a small wedge shaped one.  It seems that tsuba started to be mounted on the nakago in the early Heian period.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, there are a couple of surviving kenukigata tachi where the tsuba had to be mounted by sliding it on over the kissaki and down the blade.  The tsuba was retained in place with a small pin through the blade.  That method didn't seem to last too long.<br/>
<br/>

  Tom et all, there is a pic of a tsuba early on in Hakasui's Nippon-to ( <br/>
  don't have the book in front of me ) that is an old rusted job found in <br/>
  a tomb from memory,  it too has a large opening not unlike the one Jim <br/>
  posted in his album. ( I hope the grey matter is working correctly )<br/>
<br/>
  Tom, that link didn't work for some reason, if others haven't seen this <br/>
  tsuba  look into Jims pics, the filder is called nagamaki tsuba.<br/>

I've wondered just who made these leather fittings.  Were they made by general leather workers that made all sorts of items, or by people who specialized in arms and armor?  My guess is that they weren't made by the same people who were making metal sword fittings, armor, etc., given the class issues around hide working.  Has anyone researched the pre-industrial leather trade in Japan?<br/>

I've never seen a leather Hoju tsuba, but the metal ones do have a teardrop<br/>
shaped ana.  Since this example was mounted on a nagamaki pole, the shape of<br/>
the ana matches the shape of the pole.  Probably about the same shape as a<br/>
shinai.  I'm certainly not saying that this tsuba is anywhere near as old as<br/>
Kofun jidai.  It's probably late Edo period, maybe mid Edo at the oldest.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, the Heian through Muromachi period nerikawa tachi tsuba have the<br/>
typical wedge shaped nakago ana that you'd expect for a sword.<br/>

They don't look very difficult to make, so maybe many different craftsmen made them. But my suspicion is that craftsmen that specialized in lacquer work would be the ones to capitalize in the production of these items.  I don't know anything about the leather trade in Japan,  but this work is still done today on kendo equipment.  On a better quality Do (mid-body armor) it is made with bamboo strips and a thick peace of leather that is glued to the strips and then the leather is lacquered over.  The lacquered surface is extremely durable.<br/>
