<h3>Kanteisho for kodogu ...</h3>
by <i>drjohnplissenden</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1318079959">Hi<br/>
<br/>
While realising that the award of kanteisho certificates by the NTHK <br/>
or NBTHK for kodogu is an inexact science, I have a question to ask <br/>
concerning this.<br/>
<br/>
Is the award of the various grades of such certificates based purely <br/>
upon the quality of the piece being adjudged, or do they take into <br/>
account the accepted reputation of the maker?  Put another way, is it <br/>
reasonable to assume that all kodogu adjudged, for example, as <br/>
Tokubetsu Hozon might be of roughly the same quality,irrespective of <br/>
the maker, or might such an artefact by an artist considered as Meijin <br/>
possibly be superior to one, graded as Tokubetsu Kicho, by a lesser <br/>
artist?<br/>
<br/>
Have I made clear that rather complicated question?<br/>
<br/>
