<h3>Kokusai Tosogu Kai Book and a few other books of interest</h3>
by <i>musashibobenkei</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-370246864">I want to take a moment to wish all of you a healthy and<br/>
treasure-filled 2006, and bring to your attention a new publication of<br/>
interest to Kodogu collectors, and a few other books not quite so new.<br/>
<br/>
Of the 600 copies of this book, 200 were reserved for Japan and sold<br/>
out. Most of the remainder were bought by the non-Japanese membership,<br/>
and some of you reading this might have received a copy as a gift over<br/>
the holidays. I have been given a small number to sell, and am<br/>
delighted to offer:<br/>
<br/>
NAKAMURA, NICK, EDITOR. Kokusai Tosogu Kai, 2005 International<br/>
Convention & Exhibition. Tokyo: Kokusai Tosogu Kai, 2005. First<br/>
edition. 108 p. The catalog of the first Exhibition of Kokusai Tosogu<br/>
Kai, an international group dedicated to the study and appreciation of<br/>
 tosogu, or Japanese sword fittings. Held in Louisville, Kentucky, at<br/>
the Frazier Historical Arms Museum, the exhibition featured items from<br/>
Canadian and U.S., and Japanese collections. The Japanese items, most<br/>
never having been exhibited outside of Japan, were professionally<br/>
photographed for the catalog, and reproduced to the highest standards.<br/>
The catalog also features a 14 page article by Robert Haynes, "My<br/>
First Sixty Years as a Student of Kodogu," complemented by photos from<br/>
his personal archives documenting his years of study. Also included is<br/>
an insightful colloquy between Ms. Taeko Watanabe, president of the<br/>
Sano Museum in Mishima, and Terukata Kawabata,  NBTHK Director and<br/>
Director of Kokusai Budo Renme (International Martial Arts Federation)<br/>
on "Sukashi Tsuba, Their Use and Aesthetic Beauty." A beautifully<br/>
produced book and a rare treat for students of Japanese sword<br/>
fittings. Limited to 600 copies. Hard Cover with Slipcase.<br/>
New.	$150.00<br/>
<br/>
Not to ignore sword collectors, I have on hand a recent publication<br/>
that was mentioned on one of the lists not long ago:<br/>
<br/>
KAWACHI, KUNIHIRA AND MANABE, MASAO. The Art of the Japanese Sword As<br/>
Taught by the Experts. Tokyo: Ribun, 2004. First English language<br/>
edition. ISBN: 4898062261. 156 p. This is a great little book, part<br/>
introduction for beginners, bits of history, a fabulous section of<br/>
pictures of every phase of the making of Nihonto. All of this from the<br/>
perspective of a working mukansa smith. The introductory sections will<br/>
be most useful to new collectors, but many things are pointed out that<br/>
are missing from the other classic introductory texts. Handy directory<br/>
to museums world-wide where Japanese swords can be seen.  Glossy<br/>
Pictorial Cover. New.  $65.00<br/>
<br/>
And another excellent sword reference from the other side of the globe:<br/>
<br/>
SIONG, HAN BING. Japanese Swords in Dutch Collections A Selection from<br/>
500 Descriptions in the Series Japanse Zwaarden in Nederland Bezit.<br/>
Rijswijk, Netherlands: The Netherlands Token Society, 2003. First<br/>
edition. 244 p. Translated from the Dutch by J. M. Bonsel and M.<br/>
Laros. This selection of  85 blades of the 500 cataloged by Han Bing<br/>
Song since 1979 was published to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the<br/>
Netherlands Token Society. The cataloging project included swords in<br/>
museums as well as private collections. Of those presented in this<br/>
book, a range of swords from Koto through Gendaito are shown with<br/>
oshigata and Mr. Han's scholarly and insightful comments.  Seventeen<br/>
of the blades are also presented in photographs, and there are 14<br/>
pages of full color photographs of the best of the koshirae. An<br/>
outstanding publication of the highest quality and most valuable<br/>
content. Pictorial Hardcover. New. 	$125.00<br/>
<br/>
Back to fittings, I have been thoroughly enjoying the next recently<br/>
published book. Mr. Ito was a student of Sasano, and I am told that<br/>
this volume is to be followed by another on Hirata Hikozo. I'm keeping<br/>
my fingers crossed!<br/>
<br/>
ITO, MITSURO. Works of Kanshiro Nishigaki. Tokyo: 2005. First edition.<br/>
A lavishly produced survey of the works of the four generations of<br/>
Kanshiro Nishigaki, one of the four major Higo fittings makers. All<br/>
color photos, over 250 items, text in Japanese but photo captions also<br/>
in English. Hard Cover with Slipcase. New. $275.00<br/>
<br/>
Finally, I have to mention a book that every student of the Arts of<br/>
Japan ought to have. This was very hard to find and quite expensive<br/>
for many years until the bulk of the 2000 copies, which had been<br/>
stored since the late '70s, were located a little over a year ago.<br/>
Anyone who has a copy of "Legend in Japanese Art" should have this,<br/>
and if you don't have a copy of Joly's book, I can help you with that<br/>
as well.<br/>
<br/>
TOMPKINS, JOHN BARR, AND DOROTHY CAMPBELL TOMPKINS . People, Places<br/>
and Things in Henri Joly's Legend in Japanese Art An Analytical Index.<br/>
Alexandria VA: Kirin Books & Art, 1978. First and only edition. 217 p.<br/>
 In response to a letter written to the International Netsuke<br/>
Collectors Society Journal, and based on their own frustration in<br/>
using "Legend," the authors produced an analytical subject index to<br/>
Henri Joly's essential reference work "Legend in Japanese Art."  A<br/>
limited edition of 2000 copies.  Hard Cover with Dust Jacket. New.  <br/>
$35.00<br/>
<br/>
Of course I have many other books listed on my website, and continue<br/>
to add inventory from the shelves and many boxes of uncataloged books<br/>
that drive my wife crazy! If there is a book you have been searching<br/>
for that you don't see, please ask as it's likely I have it.<br/>
<br/>
I want to thank all of you that have supported my efforts over the<br/>
past year, and I continue to look forward to the satisfaction I get<br/>
from finding great homes for great books. I'm preparing for the Tampa<br/>
show, and hope to spend time there with friends both old and new.<br/>
