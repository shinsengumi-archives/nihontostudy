<h3>Goto resources</h3>
by <i>ronpolansky</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2039380138">Gentlemen:<br/>
<br/>
I have a set of koshirae that appears to have been made by a student <br/>
of Goto Seijo (5th). The student is not listed in the Kinko Meikan. <br/>
(info from the Murtha fittings volume)<br/>
<br/>
Is there any English language resource on the Goto artisans that <br/>
would list genealogies, students etc. ?<br/>
What is the best Japanese language resource on this kinko school?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
Ron P.</div>

For sideline Goto the best book I'm aware of is "Studies in Kyo Goto" (Kyo<br/>
Goto no Kenkyu) by Koju Kasahara and Shigeo Akimoto, 1988.  It is in English<br/>
and Japanese.  The Seijo family chart shows one student of Seijo Masafuku<br/>
(the 5th) and his name is Enomoto Kiyotsugu.  He later changed his name to<br/>
Kiyohisa.  There are some other students of other generations listed too.<br/>

Very helpful! Kiyotsugu, that is the artist. When did he work?<br/>
(I need to pay more attention to your resources page, Jim. I noticed <br/>
the book was listed there)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks very much!<br/>
Ron<br/>
ps Bob R, do you have this book? If so, how much is it? (please email <br/>
me privately)<br/>

<h3>Bob R; got your ears on?</h3>
by <i>gentleman9</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-851878959">Just to let everyone know that doesn't already. As Ron<br/>
pointed out I do find books (and anything else LEGAL)<br/>
over here in Japan for folks that ask. Sometimes I can<br/>
find them very easily other times it takes me some<br/>
time to locate them throughout Japan and have them<br/>
shipped to me to send out. It has been a while since I<br/>
updated my site and for that I appologize. But to find<br/>
items or books any information you can get me such as<br/>
ISBN Number is extremely helpful so is a picture of<br/>
the cover as I am SLOWLY learning to read Japanese.<br/>
