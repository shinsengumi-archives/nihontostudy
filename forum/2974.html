<h3>Tsuba help</h3>
by <i>odrike</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-581988993">Hi all,<br/>
I would like to have some help kantei this tsuba. It was fitted on a <br/>
mumei wakazashi I bought.<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://hem.bredband.net/odrike/Tsuba5.htm">http://hem.bredband.net/odrike/Tsuba5.htm</a><br/>
<br/>
I have seen that Richard Turner have displayed some tsubas with same or <br/>
similar design. Would the description of the design on this auction be <br/>
accurate for my tsuba aswell?<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Would it be possible to determine age or school? Akasaka has been <br/>
mentioned for tsubas with same design. Could this one be an Akasaka?<br/>
<br/>
Any information is appreciated even if you say it’s a Chinese copy.<br/>
<br/>

Fredrik</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-726110629">Hi Fredrik, very nice tsuba and not it is not a Chinese rip-off I can <br/>
assure you. Akasaka would fit, as would Tosa Myochin. I notice there is <br/>
no carving in the hira ( surface ) usually the tea whisks ( 3 and 9 <br/>
o'clock ) have the brush ( whisk ) lines carved in them and the Ginger <br/>
leaves ( 12 and 6 o'clock ) have usually 3 dots ( see this image <br/>

)<br/>
and 3 lines on them as well. The surface does not look like Akasaka <br/>
plate to me, I may be wrong, it's quite rough and pitted up close. It <br/>
could point to a late students work I guess, or a late copy, none the <br/>
less, I think it is a late tsuba, as in the end of the Edo period sometime.<br/>
<br/>
Just some ramblings LOL, they may be all wrong.<br/>

<h3>Re: [nihontostudy] Tsuba help</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-921001265">Hi Rich and readers,<br/>
Thank you for the answer. I read on Mr Gilberts page about Akasaka Tsuba.<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://home.earthlink.net/~jggilbert/akasaka.htm">http://home.earthlink.net/~jggilbert/akasaka.htm</a> <br/>
<<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://home.earthlink.net/%7Ejggilbert/akasaka.htm">http://home.earthlink.net/%7Ejggilbert/akasaka.htm</a>><br/>
I quote.<br/>
<br/>
“Akasaka tsuba are constructed with a hard skin layer sandwiching <br/>
softer, inner layers. This can sometimes be seen on the mimi or in the <br/>
walls of the sukashi. I have not seen this technique used on either Kyo <br/>
or Owari tsuba “.<br/>
<br/>
I took a hard look on my tsuba to see if I could see any layers. I took <br/>
some pictures of what I could see. I wonder if what the images <br/>
represents could be just that. Or the layer displayed simply is due to <br/>
patination?<br/>

<br/>
You are mentioning that the surface doesn’t look like Akasaka and it <br/>
might be a late copy. Do you mean as in shiiremono?<br/>
<br/>
Could the surface be more suited for Tosa-Myochin which you are mentioning?<br/>
<br/>
Here are some dimensions if it could help.<br/>
7.0 cm H x 6.8 cm W x 0.6 cm mimi and seppa dai<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for your time.<br/>

If you would care to reply to me offline I'll give you a little more info.

<h3>Re: Tsuba help</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-733083492">Dear Patrick<br/>
<br/>
Yes indeed - one of the Namban group and probably made by a casting <br/>
process in the early-mid C19.  This group is characterised by its <br/>
openwork and undercutting; the common presence of affronted dragons <br/>
with the tama jewel; and the atypically shaped seppa-dai.  All of <br/>
these are present on your tsuba.<br/>
<br/>
I would have expected a tsuba of this type to be of iron, but some <br/>
were cast in bronze.  Interestingly these are unexpectedly attracted <br/>
by a magnet, but the admixture of up to 30% of iron to bronze in <br/>
order to reduce the cost of the expensive alloy was not unknown.  <br/>
Also, iron was a common inclusion in naturally occurring copper ore <br/>
<br/>

<h3>Re: [nihontostudy] Tsuba help</h3>
by <i>retalt</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-715092139">Hi Patrick. Looks like a Namban tsuba, made of brass and possibly and <br/>
finished in Shakudo, though I am not completely sure on the finish. It <br/>
would probably date to sometime in the Edo period. So what does all that <br/>
mean ?<br/>
<br/>
Namban refers to a tsuba school that specialised in Chinese styles or forms.<br/>
Shakudo is a mix of alloys (95% brass and 5 gold) that makes a very <br/>
black finish.<br/>
The Edo period ran from 1615 to 1868 app.<br/>
<br/>
The theme is two dragons, intertwined in arabesques, and at the top <br/>
looks t0o be the sacred jewel of Shinto and bottom, some form of mon ( <br/>
family crest )<br/>
<br/>
I could be way off on all of that of course.<br/>
<br/>
hope that helps a bit.<br/>

<br/>
I've posted a photo of the interesting namban tsuba that John had referred to earlier. The motif consists of dragons and catfish, a shrine (with gold jewel peak), breaking waves and vines (?) in sukashi work. This large tsuba (84mm rnd. x 4mm thick) has Tokubetsu Hozon certificate. The poster is in Yahoo photos: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://tinyurl.com/yxt45h">http://tinyurl.com/yxt45h</a><br/>
in a file named: Ron STL  Perhaps John wishes to elaborate on this tsuba a bit more? <br/>
<br/>
John, I've just received my copy of your book, "The Namban Group of Japanese Sword Guards; Aa Reappraisal" and I'm looking forward to digesting your research findings which make up this publication. Interesting!<br/>

  Dear Patrick<br/>
<br/>
  Yes indeed - one of the Namban group and probably made by a casting <br/>
  process in the early-mid C19. This group is characterised by its <br/>
  openwork and undercutting; the common presence of affronted dragons <br/>
  with the tama jewel; and the atypically shaped seppa-dai. All of <br/>
  these are present on your tsuba.<br/>
<br/>
  I would have expected a tsuba of this type to be of iron, but some <br/>
  were cast in bronze. Interestingly these are unexpectedly attracted <br/>
  by a magnet, but the admixture of up to 30% of iron to bronze in <br/>
  order to reduce the cost of the expensive alloy was not unknown. <br/>
  Also, iron was a common inclusion in naturally occurring copper ore <br/>

<h3>Re: Tsuba help</h3>
by <i>drjohnplissenden</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-946660186">Dear Ron<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for posting a photograph of your beautiful, papered Namban <br/>
tsuba.  At 84 cms in width it is unusually large for the group - only <br/>
some 3 per cent measure that or more, and the largest one I have seen <br/>
was 93 cms.  It is also unusual in that it has two contemporaneous <br/>
ryo-hitsu, and that these are both hangetsu-gata.  Does the smaller <br/>
one have sekigane?<br/>
<br/>
The iron appears to be good, although the extensive carving on these <br/>
tsubas meant that the iron was never of very good quality.  The <br/>
carving of the undercut karakusa and the surface chisel-work are <br/>
sharp and excellent.  The plain, squared rim; the absence of OTT gold <br/>
overlay; the conventionally shaped seppa-dai and ryo-hitsu; and the <br/>
asymmetrical design all combine to  impart a dignity that is seldom <br/>
associated with tsuba of this group.<br/>
<br/>
This is a beautiful tsuba, and well-deserving of its tokubetsu hozon <br/>
status.  I am hesitant to give a firm time period.  On the one hand, <br/>
because of the introduction of better metal-working tools, those <br/>
Namban tsuba of a later period are generally the more skillfully <br/>
made.  Conversely, those with conventional seppa-dai were often <br/>
earlier.  I imagine that the kanteisho says 'Edo period'?  Shall we <br/>
say mid-late C18? <br/>
<br/>
Regards, John L.<br/>
<br/>
P.S.   I hope that you enjoy the book.<br/>

Whilst we are on the topic of Namban tsuba I have posted two (not so good) images of my Namban tsuba that took a green paper at the first NBTHK Shinsa in the USA mmm maybe 35 years ago.  The obverse (red background) is convex whilst the reverse (green background) is flat.  A polisher visiting once commented "a good one!!".  Early Edo period ca 1670, I believe.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, it's in my folder "Barry Thomas" third one on the first page (sorry, no tiny url.  Something else I have to learn how to do!).  John I think I sent you these images quite some while ago???<br/>

I am sorry, but I don't recall seeing the images of your Namban tsuba <br/>
before and I am unable to find them in my 'in box'.  Is a green paper <br/>
from the NBTHK 35 years ago the equivalent of a tokubetsu kicho paper <br/>
(or perhaps it has just turned green with age!)<br/>
<br/>
Namban tsuba are incredibly difficult to photograph, and this <br/>
difficulty is compounded when the metal is dark.  A tsuba of this <br/>
group with a plano-convex profile is very unusual - I have certainly <br/>
never seen one.  It has the ubiquitous, symmetrical design of <br/>
affrontes dragons facing the tama jewel (or is it a lotus blossom?, <br/>
with lashings of gold overlay.  The alternating, perforated design <br/>
inside the mimi is a commonly found one, as is the chryanthemoid <br/>
mimi.  Interestingly, the seppa-dai is only gilded on the omote <br/>
surface - I sometimes wonder how well would the seppa sit on a seppa-<br/>
dai such as this.  The kodzuka-hitsu is clearly a later addition.<br/>
<br/>
The photographs are much too dark to enable any deatailed assessment <br/>
of the carving and undercutting, but it appears to be of quite good <br/>
quality.<br/>
<br/>
Date?  Who am I to argue with 1670, but that seems to be a pretty <br/>
exact attribution.  Perhaps I would put it rather later - what does <br/>
the kanteisho say?<br/>

Thanks for your assessment.  Yes, it is a Tokubetsu Kicho ninteisho.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > Interestingly, the seppa-dai is only gilded<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This gilded surface is actually a gilded copper plate that comes out.  Underneath it is the same stylised seppa dai as the other side.  It begs the question as to whether there was at one time a similar plate in the other side.<br/>
<br/>
I regret the poor quality of the photographs - I took them hurriedly some years ago.  Currently the tsuba is not to hand, being on exhibition with other swords and tosogu.  When it comes back to me I'll take new photos.<br/>
