<h3>goin&#39; Japanese</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1120577679">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
This is only peripherally related to sword study, but here goes...<br/>
<br/>
I've pretty much read through everything sword related that I can find <br/>
that's printed in English, so I guess its time to learn Japanese -<br/>
The question I have is what's the least time consuming way to do this? I <br/>
know this probably sounds stupid, but<br/>
 I've studied several other languages in the past (grade school, high <br/>
school, etc.,), and it seemed to be a<br/>
fairly drawn out/painful affair, and I was debatin' whether to just sign <br/>
up for a course at the local college or what...<br/>
<br/>
thanks,<br/>

<br/>
According to the Defense Agency Foreign Language School in Santa Cruz, the<br/>
only more difficult language to learn than Japanese is Chinese for us. I<br/>
would recommend college courses as a start and then self study of the kanji<br/>
related to swords.<br/>

Find the private tutor. That will be the best for you. As Japanese <br/>
grammar is completely different from English, it will blow out your <br/>
head. Nice tutor will guide you much better and can amplify your <br/>
interest about this field.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-366603630">I'm going to have to agree with Jinsoo. I'm presently<br/>
taking a College level Japanese course. I swear to god<br/>
they make absolutely beautiful blades and fittings but<br/>
SHIT they need to stick to one method of numbering and<br/>
grammar rules. And to truely learn Japanese you have<br/>
to learn Romanji, Hirigana, Katagana, and Kanji so<br/>
that's four different languages in one. Oh yea and<br/>
things that are flat are counted differently than<br/>
those that are round. What the Hell is up with that?!?<br/>
Best advice get a tutor.<br/>
