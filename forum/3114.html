<h3>Heianjo Sukashi questions</h3>
by <i>davidzincavage</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-648283137">I'm a bit puzzled about Heianjo sukashi tsubas.  Why do you suppose it is that neither Torigoye nor Sasano discuss them?  Heianjo, in this case, I would assume, just means they were made in Kyoto.  So, how would Heianjo sukashi be different from  Kyo sukashi?  How does one identify these?<br/>

My understanding is that it is more of an age<br/>
division. For example, exact same Sasano tsuba is<br/>
photographed in 2 books. It is a mid 1500s piece. In<br/>
the older book it is called 'Heian Jo Sukashi'. In<br/>
another book it is called 'Kyo Sukashi' and the age is<br/>
denoted in the subsequent description.<br/>
  I suppose you could call it a "ko kyo" sukashi, but<br/>
sounds odd to me.<br/>

I would have thought Richard George's first tsuba<br/>

<br/>
The old term Heianjo Sukashi is no longer in use having been replaced <br/>
by Kyo-Sukushi. If you have an older book, you will still see this <br/>
term. This also helps avoid confusion with Heianjo tsuba, which are <br/>
typically thin iron plates with brass inlays.<br/>
