<h3>Question about &quot;The Sword and the Same&quot;</h3>
by <i>musashibobenkei</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-274689079">The original 1913 edition of this book, and a copy I have here of the<br/>
Tuttle 1963 reprint, both have a fold out "Synoptical Table of the<br/>
Nengo" between the two books, i.e. between page 179 (the end of "The<br/>
Sword Book ...) and page 3 (the beginning of "Book of Same).<br/>
<br/>
I'm looking at a copy of "The Sword and the Same,"  the Holland Press<br/>
reprint (1979 printing) and it does not have this chart, not torn or<br/>
cut out, just not there. I'm hesitant to conclude that none of the<br/>
Holland reprints have the chart, so if anyone who has a copy of this<br/>
book could check for the fold out Nengo chart and let me know what you<br/>
find, my bibliographic curiosity will be satisfied. Holland reprinted<br/>
it several times starting in 1963, so tell me which printing you have,<br/>
and if there is or is not a Nengo chart. If you happen to have a copy<br/>
of the Tuttle reprint other than the 1963 - I'm not sure they printed<br/>
it more than once - and let me know the same information, I'd<br/>
appreciate it.<br/>
<br/>
Please mail me directly at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:bridgeofdreams@...">bridgeofdreams@...</a>, no need to reply<br/>
to the list(s). I'll summarize the information for all.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
