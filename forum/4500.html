<h3>Kyo Tsuba Price Reduction</h3>
by <i>frkirk</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-529959944">Hi all <br/>
I will knock the tusba down $100 to $795 (price does not include <br/>
shiping/insurance). If it doesn't go in the next few days I will then <br/>
ppost it to other outlets. <br/>
Also on the books I have up <br/>
I was wrong about the Token to Rekeishi- it does have a fair bit of <br/>
English in it- again they are published by the NTHK (NPO) <br/>
I will sell the whole set for $20 ppd in USA <br/>
I will also knock another $5 off the Chtisties and sell it for $15 ppd <br/>
in USA <br/>
I will give them a few days here before posting them to ebay. <br/>
email me with any questions <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:kirk-becky@...">kirk-becky@...</a> <br/>
Thanks for the time and the bandwidth! <br/>
