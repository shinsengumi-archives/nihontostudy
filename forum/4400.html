<h3>The Conscience of the Collector</h3>
by <i>elliottshogun</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-575002610">I just read for the 1st time, 'The Conscience of the Collector' by <br/>
Robert E. Haynes. "Right On"! <br/>
<br/>
Robert states "All of the large group meetings held in the West, for <br/>
the collectors of swords and fittings, are not of an intellectual <br/>
nature but almost purely of a material dealer/merchant nature; this has <br/>
been so for over forty years." Does that hit home or what? I will have <br/>
my second show of attendance this coming weekend.<br/>
<br/>
I hope to attend all of the lectures, it's the only way to continue my <br/>
education. I have to admit, I will have a table this year. I will have <br/>
Tsuba (I went overboard collecting tsuba), sword bags and stands (for <br/>
tsuba and swords) for sale. All of my items for sale are 'Hand Made'. <br/>
But my intention is not to attend shows to sell. I want to attend shows <br/>
to LEARN.<br/>
<br/>
So, I hope to meet Robert E. Haynes and tell him "I agree, there are <br/>
too many in this field who are only business oriented."</div>
