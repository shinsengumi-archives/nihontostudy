<h3>Kinko Meikan question</h3>
by <i>musashibobenkei</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-431266306">I have a question from a customer about the editions of the Kinko Meikan.<br/>
The original edition published in 1974 has four mei photos per page, and<br/>
there is a wonderfully handy translation published by the NCJSC that was<br/>
done by John Yumoto and Alan Harvie, which is still available from the club.<br/>
 <br/>
Obviously the translation makes this edition far more desirable to<br/>
non-readers of Japanese than the later edition(s) which show six mei photos<br/>
per page, and of course do not match up with the translation at all.<br/>
 <br/>
My question has to do with my recollection - it was perhaps even a<br/>
discussion on one of the lists long ago - that the problem with the first<br/>
edition was the significant number of gimei signatures illustrated, and<br/>
perhaps other errors. These were then corrected in the later editions.<br/>
 <br/>
I've searched what archives I have to verify this bit of information kicking<br/>
around my aging and untrustworthy brain without success. Can anyone<br/>
corroborate or refute this or shed any light on the subject?<br/>
 <br/>
And before anyone asks, I'm out of stock on the first edition, but you can<br/>
add your name to the want list. Second edition orders will be filled right<br/>
away!<br/>

	I haven't heard this, not that I am the endall, but I think <br/>
you'll find with a simple knowledge of kanji and kana the second <br/>
edition and the Yumoto translation can be used together. The same <br/>
names and photos appear in both with a number of additions in the <br/>
second. A serious study of the 2nd using the translation would allow <br/>
you to suss out the info in many of the additional entries and would <br/>
be a great way to reinforce ones Nihongo lessons...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1826169525">Hi. I cannot answer your question directly, but for whatever its<br/>
failings might or might not be, I understand that the photographs in the<br/>
1st were taken from fittings actually seen rather than being photographs<br/>
of photographs as is common. I am sure that the highest value added<br/>
would be  from the 1st and translation, along with a list of the gimei<br/>
if known. Arnold <br/>

<h3>RE: [nihontostudy] Kinko Meikan question</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1563196556">Tom and Arnold, thanks for your replies, you both made excellent<br/>
observations.<br/>
<br/>
I spoke with Robert Haynes yesterday and raised the issue with him. <br/>
<br/>
To summarize, he was not aware of any particular problem with gimei pieces,<br/>
in fact he said that compared to other references (like Wakayama) that were<br/>
produced from submitted photographic examples (which Arnold pointed out,)<br/>
Kinko Meikan was done mostly from examples in hand and was a more reliable<br/>
reference.<br/>
<br/>
He of course mentioned, as Tom pointed out, there is not really a problem<br/>
using the translation with the later edition if one is willing to work a<br/>
little at reading the kanji and kana, and certainly one will learn more by<br/>
doing so.<br/>
<br/>
Bob said that he had started to make a comparison list between the first and<br/>
later editions, as some examples in the first were dropped, most stayed, and<br/>
of course many were added. His conclusion has been that the later edition is<br/>
more complete and accurate and therefore the better reference.<br/>
<br/>
Of course that still leaves me wondering *which* book it was that supposedly<br/>
had many gimei in the first edition ... or if my memory is manufacturing<br/>
things.<br/>
