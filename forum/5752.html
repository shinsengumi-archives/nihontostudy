<h3>Rebellion Swords</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1437319477">Or so we are told-<br/>
Is there any evidence or original reference that identifies these  <br/>
swords as definitively made for/during the Satsuma Rebellion? Pieces I  <br/>
have seen are typically poor quality swords, with poor quality  <br/>
fittings very roughly made and usually lacquer that seems to have been  <br/>
a few coats shy of a full job.<br/>
<br/>
Some but not all are clearly Satsuma koshirae which is all I think  <br/>
these things are, just poor quality Satsuma koshirae. Hence my  <br/>
question - has anyone seen reference to these in Japanese sources?  <br/>
What are they called in Japanese and what is the rationale for  <br/>
assigning these to the rebellion specifically?<br/>
