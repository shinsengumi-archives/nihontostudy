<div id="ygrps-yiv-363698344">Yes, it's mine.  Thanks.  There are much better examples including some that show areas of what appear to be the original surface and very nicely done hirazogan (no doubt revealed only after very careful cleaning).  <br/>
<br/>
Some years ago John Badenhop had a museum journal in Japanese that showed these guards being cleaned with a plasma etching technique.  The chemistry was presumably chosen to etch the rust while having some reasonable selectivity to the unoxidized iron and the inlay.  I only got a quick look, so I don't know the details.  <br/>
<br/>

Some of the blades of this period also show extensive inlay in silver and sometimes gold.  Some of these sat unrecognized for years before they were cleaned sufficiently to reveal the inlay.  "Windows on the Japanese Past: Studies in Archaeology and Prehistory" has an article or two on these swords as I recall.  There's even a piece there by some guy named Bleed, although not sword related.<br/>

I suspect that there may be iron tsunagi in some of those koshirae.  The older one with the also unillustrated "...mune saku, Nanbokucho blade" was the one that was I was going on about.  The "younger" one is pretty interesting, too.  I wish I had seen Choshu-ya's koshirae, but I'd like to have seen a complete example of the older one even more.  But, I stayed home instead.<br/>

BTW, I got a copy from Ian on the yahoo nihonto list of your public mention of the kenkyu-in thing there.  Thanks for the recognition.  I have a lot of work to do.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-563821879">Hi Jim,<br/>
<br/>
You're welcome. Maybe soon we can have katakana on our fittings <br/>
kanteisho!! Since this information didn't go out on this list, let me <br/>
add that kenkyu-in is the first step to becoming a member of the shinsa <br/>
team. All of the members of the present team went through the ranks. <br/>
The next step is shinsa-in hosa, which means an assistant to the shinsa <br/>
team. Assistants should fill out the working papers -- in Japanese. I <br/>
could somewhat manage this, but in the end, I was given a break. The <br/>
third stage is full shinsa team member. This all typically takes about <br/>
four years or so from kenkyu-in to full shinsa team member.<br/>
<br/>
I will also try and scan a photo of Choshu-ya's koshirae. I don't think <br/>
it sold.<br/>

I'd like to see the pictures of Choshu-ya's koshirae if you can do it.  <br/>
<br/>
I'm in the middle of a shodo course at Japan Society in NYC and plan to keep at it.  Token and kodogu are hard enough, but the koshirae worksheet descriptions are going to be a monster challenge.  Edo period machibori kodogu kantei is also going to take a lot of work.  I don't know about four years but it sure is motivating.<br/>
