<div id="ygrps-yiv-1670166890">I am curious about this too.<br/>
<br/>
I also have a tsuba, a signed Akasaka piece of broken fan motif with the same type of insert as would be exposed when mounted.  Further, while it has some very skillfully applied sekigane of the same hue (presumably applied at the same time); the exterior work as with your tsuba has received additional treatment.  It has been finished in black only to its interior edge so as to be indiscernible when mounted.<br/>
<br/>
When shown to Jim Gilbert he offered that it may have been a restoration after being modified for a western-styled retaining clip.  But again, this was only one of the possibilities.<br/>
<br/>
What is clear is that great care was give to add this feature and it was skillfully applied.<br/>
<br/>
I should like to hear what others have to say on the subject and will post a picture if anyone is interested.  Perhaps Jim remembers the guard that I am describing and can comment further.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Happy Holidays, <br/>
