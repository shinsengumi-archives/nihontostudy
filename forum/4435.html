Saturday. I gave a short talk similar to the one in San Francisco,  <br/>
and it was a pretty good turn out for a one off event.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I was not able to make it for the show and had two swords I was going to<br/>
submit for shinsa. One already had NBTHK attribution at Juyo level and<br/>
as it was a mumei, I was interested in alternate attributions.<br/>
<br/>
As I didn't make it, neither were submitted.<br/>
<br/>
Does the NTHK accept such blades? I was told somewhat vaguely that they<br/>
may not so I would like to know if I should bother submitting things<br/>
like this in the future?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1176767058">Let me tell you my story...........I sent a Katana to Moses B. for <br/>
polishing. This blade is suriage and the Mei that is present <br/>
is 'Bizen (no) Kuni Ju Osafune'(cut). This blade has paper from <br/>
Inami Hakusui. He papered it to a Shinto Sukesada. From my studies <br/>
and the opinion of others, only Koto blades were signed as above <br/>
(Bizen Kuni Ju Osafune (name)). <br/>
<br/>
Moses and I decided to submit it to the NY NTHK Shinsa to learn <br/>
their opinion. I haven't heard from Moses yet but am very curious. <br/>
Did they even give it paper? As soon as I hear, I will let you know <br/>
the out come.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-879652817">Moses,<br/>
<br/>
I have kept all e-mails between us since sending you the blade (July <br/>
12, 2005). The only mention in regards to the Boshi was that it <br/>
was 'hard to see'. It was never said to me that it was missing or <br/>
running off. I also had no idea this was considered a fatal flaw. <br/>
<br/>
It would have been all right to tell me that polishing would not <br/>
make the Boshi appear. And at that point, I would have probably ask <br/>
for the blade returned to me. As far as the NTHK (or any other group)<br/>
and their Shinsa, all I wanted was their opinion as to whether the <br/>
blade was Sue-Bizen or Shinto-Bizen. <br/>
<br/>
As I told you before, I have learned from this experience and that <br/>
is good. I don't hold anything against anybody. I will continue to <br/>
ask questions of you and do future business with you. All is well!<br/>

With the hawk count shut down due to rainy weather I'm catching up on things post-shinsa.<br/>
<br/>
The fittings shinsa team this time around took quite a lot of time scratching our heads to come up with informative attributions on the mumei stuff.  There were quite a few attributions to schools and groups.  The problem simply is that for many pieces there is nothing distinctive enough about the workmanship or quality to go beyond just Kyo, Edo or Mito Kinko.  Throwing out something more specific isn't going to help anyone learn if there are multiple other groups turning out work of the same style.<br/>
<br/>
Honestly I found my self thinking several times "why would someone submit this item to shinsa?"  You want to give the customer his money's worth, but there's very little that can be said about the piece.  It's kind of like being handed a T-shirt and being asked which fashion design house it came from.<br/>

  Subject: [nihontostudy] Re: Jersey City sword show............ a suggestion, if I may<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  we were discussing on another sword list about the shinsa paper.<br/>
  Specifically the paper on mumei fittings that passed.<br/>
  Quite often, we get the passing origami attributing the piece to just " <br/>
  Kyo kinko ".<br/>
  A suggestion if I may............. how about the shinsa team be a <br/>
  little bit more specific in the attribution ( mumei fittings ), say for <br/>
  example " kyo kinko in the style of so and so ", rather than just Kyo <br/>
  kinko ?<br/>
  This would help the collectors in further study, yes ?<br/>

to avoid submitting stuff i shouldn't, have a question for <br/>
you...........<br/>
<br/>
If the " hagiri " appears right below the hamachi, by definition it is <br/>
not a " hagiri " since it is located on the nakago, yes ?<br/>
<br/>
So if I have a sword with hagiri ( hidden under the habaki ), just <br/>
above the hamachi, and if I have Big Mo " reshape the nakago just a <br/>
little and also " move up " the hamachi.........wella, no more hagiri ??<br/>
<br/>
Would the shinsa team pinkie it just because there's a nakagogiri ( the <br/>
term doesn't exist, I check the books........ =)   )? <br/>
<br/>
Not that I would submit this  as you promise  previously a special pink <br/>
sheet for me..........just curious.<br/>

I think there is a name --- machi-okuri.  :)<br/>

So just wondering if a small hagiri under the habaki is the reason<br/>
that blades become machi-okuri.<br/>
