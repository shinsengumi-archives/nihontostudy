<h3>A non menuki question</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-564427944">Hello all!!<br/>
 <br/>
OK I have me a question...<br/>
 <br/>
I was working on a tachi out in the studio a little more than a week  <br/>
ago.... got it all welded up in kobuse construction , shobu zukuri,  and when I <br/>
was doing yaki-ire the dang thing curved like a cavalry   sabre...I have <br/>
about 1 1/2" of sori on a nagasa of just under 28".. So how much  sori is too <br/>
much?? <br/>
 <br/>
I mean it is quite pleasing to the eye, very appealing in fact but it sorta <br/>
 looks like a caricature of a sword. <br/>
 <br/>
The sori is tori-sori nice and even the length of the blade, so in keeping  <br/>
with that I went ahead and curved the nakago to match the sori in the blade <br/>
to  stay with the "lines" of the sword...<br/>
 <br/>
It is in mid polish right now and once I get it mounted I will post some  <br/>
pics... I am amazed that the thing held together in the quench as it was <br/>
moaning  and groaning and dancing around while it was in the tank but I didn't <br/>
hear one  "Tink"  or "Toink"  and no cracks are coming up and I am at 800 <br/>
grit  on the polish (I don't use stones..I am doing this for book IV and am <br/>
using  available abrasives that just about anyone can get...and I must say I am <br/>
getting  some really nice results on the blades I am making...)<br/>
 <br/>
So did I make an abomination with 1 1 /2" of sori??? This should cut really <br/>
 well with that much curve but I dunno...<br/>

Thanks all!!<br/>

 <br/>
Matt:<br/>
 <br/>
It was pretty much straight..well as straight as I can  get it with a <br/>
hammer doing the sunobe.<br/>
 <br/>
I think I may of done something when I changed the  quenchant. Usually I <br/>
harden in hot salt water about 200 degrees F..This stuff  I was using a mix of <br/>
sodium hydroxide, ammonium nitrate (Caustic blue salts)  and table salt, <br/>
mixed in and heated to 290 degrees F.. I think that may of set  it up for the <br/>
heavy sori.<br/>
 <br/>
As it is I am seeing a nice hamon starting to come up  at 1000 grit..and I <br/>
am happy about that still no signs of any cracking...I did  draw the whole <br/>
thing back to 450 F as a "safety measure" to prevent any  chip-outs in <br/>
cutting.  This was the first time I used this particular  quenchant mix and temp <br/>
on yaki-ire... Kinda bugs me but it isn't that "bad"  once you get use to use <br/>
to it...<br/>

A shobu zukuri tachi with high sori sounds a little unusual, but we'll be waiting for the photos.  Good to hear from you.  I just pulled your '87 book off the shelf for another read after many years.<br/>

to introduce a reverse curve so it ended up straight(ish) after <br/>
yake-ire. I can imagine a Tachi many times the size of my effort curving <br/>

Oh it was that..more like a screech owl though...It was moaning, groaning  <br/>

 <br/>
Now when you harden you expect  to get some sori but this was  extreme. <br/>
Looking at the blade I have enough "meat" at the kissaki to do a nicer  kissaki <br/>

I left this one a bit thick as I didn't know what was going to  happen <br/>
