        For the listies; <br/>

        All- <br/>
Same was clearly used on handles and scabbards from earliest times. <br/>
In the Edo period presentation skins were mounted in fine brocade and <br/>
were cherished gifts.As Gordon has said it was used as decoration on <br/>
armour.<br/>
<br/>
        Today we can purchase kendo armours with lacquered ray skin <br/>
do in a variety of colors. I think the problem with ray skin as <br/>
armour is not the climate, after all witness all those handles still <br/>
in existance, it is more likely for two reasons I can think of. One <br/>
the size of the skins, todays do use two or three skins, which look <br/>
great but would be weak at the point of overlap. There was surely a <br/>
monster ray in those days that would have done the job with a sigle <br/>
skin, even then it would have been a rare creature however. Two wear <br/>
and tear, the lacquered do of today can take a lot of abuse from <br/>
bamboo shinae but a blade is another story. Initially it would look <br/>
great but with the first cut would be scarred and weakened and would <br/>
only become uglier with each battle, I am sure someone tried it but <br/>
feel it would not have appealed to samurai sensibilites¡Ä<br/>
