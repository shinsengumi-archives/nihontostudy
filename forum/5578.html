What does the term "chikara gane" mean when refering to the back of menuki? On something AY translated for me decades ago he wrote, "...in the base, chikara gane comes to be used." This is a translation describing menuki from mid-Edo period. (Kinko Mino bori p.109)<br/>

<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
The method of attaching menuki to the handle went from the male-female posts<br/>
or inyôkon that passed through the handle and the nakago fastening the<br/>
menuki to each other to chikara-gane. These inyôkon posts continued until<br/>
the late Muromachi period into the Momoyama period. They are also seen on<br/>
generally high class works for the mid to late Edo period; however, they no<br/>
longer went all the way through the tsuka and basically worked as the newer<br/>
chikara-gane do. As noted, strength and metal is the literal translation,<br/>
but more accurately I would call them reinforced/strengthened tabs of<br/>
typically copper. On an added note, at least the first three generations of<br/>
the main line Goto masters are said to have only used inyôkon posts and<br/>
menuki without them will typically be attributed to Ko-Goto rather than one<br/>
of the main guys. I expect we will be catching up with many on the list in<br/>
San Francisco next month. I am certainly looking forward to it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-367467875">Hi Ron,<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Grapes are a motif that was brought in on the silk road and are of Greek<br/>
origin, I would suspect. The famous set of Asuka period bronze statues of<br/>
Yakushi nyorai and Gakko and Nikko at Yakushi-ji in Nara have an early<br/>
example of the grape motif on the base of the Yakushi nyorai statue, so we<br/>
are talking middle 500s or so. Squirrels may be included in the motif, but I<br/>
cant recall right off hand. Thus, there is a definite Buddhist connection.<br/>
The motif shows up in sword fittings rather early and I believe there are<br/>
pieces by Joshin or at least around that time with the motif. Ko-Kinko<br/>
workers produced it, and there are also some Ko-Mino examples, if memory<br/>
serves. As you move into the Edo period, it seems to me that the motif was<br/>
not as popular. Certainly from the mid to late Edo period you do not see it<br/>
very much. If I can remember, I will see what some of my other sources have<br/>
to say. I did see your earlier message about this, but just didnt jump at<br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Sorry we will miss you in SF, but we can catch up at the Daitoken-ishi.<br/>
