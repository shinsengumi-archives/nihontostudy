<h3>Hizen nidai Yukihiro</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1308901858">Hi all - <br/>
<br/>
Just a shot-in-the-dark but I'll ask. I sold a very masculine wakizashi by nidai Hizen Yukihiro in September 2003; the buyer wanted to make up a daisho. The sword was later sold again, from what I hear, and today, is probably in one of your collections, I suspect. I've come across a full-length oshigata of the sword (made by me) that I suspect the present owner would enjoy having. I'd be happy to give it to them if "he" can be found. The sword was in polish, shirasaya, ubu and so fresh it looked like a gendai-to! Wide hamon with much nie, ara nie, splashing over the blade. I'm not sure, but the second seller could had been Bill Miller??? <br/>
