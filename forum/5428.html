 <br/>
  Heianjo are complex.  For a start, most Heianjo (real Heianjo and not Edo period copies) are Momoyama period or earlier.  They were mainly made just for a hundred years or so, basically the 16th century.  The earlier pieces are sometimes called Onin, but even if you include this group, you still only get the period around 1450-1600.  That means that they are old.  Many were lacquered.  Some were well preserved some were not.  The lacquer is part of the overall gestalt.  If you see a hundred Heianjo tsuba, 25 or so will be lacquered, of which 5 will be in excellent condition, 10 will be decently preserved, 5 will be in need of varying degrees of restoration and 5 will be dead.<br/>

<br/>
No problem (attached). The seller was a gentleman about it and settled up with me, as expected. There were multiple photos. Soon after I made this purchase another alike tsuba was offered out of Japan (350076519430) which looked very nice, but one that I thought looks newer (to my surprise, of course). I was not trying to get a bargain, but hoped to discover a Yoshiro work in a different (than mon-sukashi) for my study. Oh well, maybe next time. Making SF show???<br/>

  Hi All: <br/>
<br/>
  Heianjo are complex. For a start, most Heianjo (real Heianjo and not Edo period <br/>
  copies) are Momoyama period or earlier. They were mainly made just for a hundred <br/>
  years or so, basically the 16th century. The earlier pieces are sometimes called <br/>
  Onin, but even if you include this group, you still only get the period around <br/>
  1450-1600. That means that they are old. Many were lacquered. Some were well <br/>
  preserved some were not. The lacquer is part of the overall gestalt. If you see a <br/>
  hundred Heianjo tsuba, 25 or so will be lacquered, of which 5 will be in excellent <br/>
  condition, 10 will be decently preserved, 5 will be in need of varying degrees of <br/>
  restoration and 5 will be dead. <br/>
<br/>
  Cheers, <br/>
<br/>

  Fakes coming out of Japan have emerged as a interesting problem for<br/>
  collectors. I- for one - would like to see the eBay image of your recent<br/>
  acquisition. Would you care to post it?<br/>

<br/>
  I've always enjoyed Heianjo (never owning an Onin work that I know of) and Yoshiro <br/>
  mon-sukashi works. Always like brass inlay on good iron! <br/>
<br/>
  To my surprise, I just received what I thought looked like a nice early iron with <br/>
  brass inlay tsuba, recently purchased of Ebay, my first Ebay purchase in ages. <br/>
  After 40-odd years I thought I had a good "eye" for such things; just bought a <br/>
  repro! Yikes! Hope to reverse the deal but must admit that "pictures are <br/>
  deceiving" at times. Looks like an honest mistake on the seller's part, but it <br/>
  points up the importance of in-hand study. (I think others spotted this since my <br/>
  bid was much too low if authentic. Just mentioning this to point out how good (in <br/>
  pictures only) these repros are today. <br/>
<br/>
  Enjoyed this topic of lacquer on Heianjo works. I once owned a very similar (or <br/>
  same one?) tsuba that was pointed out here. I need to sit down and check some of <br/>
  my other early tsuba for lacquer. <br/>
