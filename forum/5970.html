<h3>Japanese Sword Books and Survey</h3>

</head> 
<font size="6">Japanese Sword Books and Now a Survey<br></font><br>We have 
been at this since 1999. First with a print catalog advertised in the Japanese 
Sword Society, United States <i>newsletter</i> and a militaria newsletter called 
<i>Bansai</i>. If you needed a clip for your Nambu with specific serial number 
<i>Bansai</i> was the place to go. The display ads in both publications was 
where we first used the dragonfly design. Back then it was from a pattern book 
and later adopted as the logo. Two years prior I had been told by a book seller 
in Pennsylvania that there were <i>only three</i> books on Japanese Swords and, 
"once you have those you have them all." There is no point in speculating on the 
number of Japanese sword and related titles were published, but suffice to say 
it are well more that 
three.<br>���������� 
Fifteen-years later I am writing having just purchased a book collection from a 
collector who was one of my first contacts after first subscribing to the JSS/US 
Newsletter. A number of these books have come  <font
 face="Times New Roman">back as they were originally purchased from satcho; it is 
not the first time that books have returned in this manner or sure. This 
collection along with others recently purchased has prompted this listing and 
some though on my reflections about different types of books and how each is 
used, IE: what is the <i>utility</i> of a given book. <font size="2">
