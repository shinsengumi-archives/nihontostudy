Thanks.  I set up the list to not allow attachments.  I don't know if it's<br/>
possible to post non-photo files on the group website.  With a small group,<br/>
mailing out the spreadsheet individually isn't a problem.<br/>
<br/>
I'm the owner/moderator, although I'm not running the list in "moderated<br/>
mode" where I would actually approve posts.  I'm hoping that we can enjoy an<br/>
open discussion of swords and fittings here without going crazy.<br/>
<br/>
Several people have had comments or questions about membership.  When I sent<br/>
out the email about the list last night, I scrolled through my address book<br/>
for the people who I thought might be interested.  If anyone has friends<br/>
that are serious about the subject and can play well with others, please<br/>
invite them to join.  I don't want to make this a closed list, but I'd<br/>
rather not go out and advertise just yet so please hold off with the web<br/>
links for now.<br/>
<br/>
I'd like to hear any thoughts about how to maintain a successful list --<br/>
just  be sure to respond off line to me at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:jggilbert@...">jggilbert@...</a> rather<br/>
than to the whole list.<br/>
