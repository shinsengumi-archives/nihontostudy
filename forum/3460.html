<h3>A good story about one tsuba with some interesting details missing</h3>
by <i>sosidore</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2015018716">Dear all, <br/>
<br/>
I have this interesting tsuba posted on Nihontostudy at:<br/>
<br/>
All Albums  | Photo Albums > Sosidore > Iron Tsuba Dragon  <br/>
 <br/>
Anyone well versed in Chinese artifacts knows this tsuba is an <br/>
unusual one. I would like to give some clue so that readers of this <br/>
message would came up with similar beliefe as I did.<br/>
<br/>
1. Chinese emperor was the only one who is entitled to put dragon <br/>
decors on everything he owned. <br/>
2. However dragons could also put to use as icons by other persons or <br/>
entities only if the number of dragon's fingers reduced to either 4 <br/>
or 3. Five fingers claws must not be used in any dragon unless the <br/>
owner of that dragon design is Chinese emperor himself. Violation of <br/>
such rule was subject to capital punishment.<br/>
3. There used to be a continued flow of sword import from Japan <br/>
dating back more than a thousand years.<br/>
4. Swords as possibly one of the contributions to Chinese emperor <br/>
during Qing Dynasty would demand unique design for their tsubas. <br/>
Guess what design would it use?<br/>
5. Any contribution to the king would bear no signature of the <br/>
artist. Guess what? This elegant iron tsuba bear no signature on <br/>
neither side.  <br/>
6. I am in no position to do the authentication on the style of the <br/>
dragon shown on this tsuba. Somehow its style poised to resemble the <br/>
one shown on Meiji coins. There is strong likelihood that this tsuba <br/>
was of Japan origin dating back to late 19th century.<br/>
7. Guess who is in the position in Japan to offer this tsuba as part <br/>
of a sword to Chinese emperor then?<br/>
<br/>
I hope you enjoy as much as I when pondering the answers to those <br/>
questions. You probably would find some interesting part of details <br/>
missing. Readers and I would like to hear them.<br/>
<br/>
Now, it is time that tsuba expert and historians take over <br/>
authentication processes from here. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>point to this being a piece that had been presented to/for the <br/>
Chinese emperor. I don't think even the dowager empress would have <br/>
been presented a dragon, perhaps a phoenix. However she was buried <br/>
with a pearl in her mouth which I believe was only for emperors. <br/>
This seems from the design to be a water dragon. Does this seem to <br/>
be Satsuma work anyone? The head of the dragon after the pearl seems <br/>
to be undefined, or maybe too busy don't you think? John</div>

<br/>
Why a 'water dragon'; surely those are stylised clouds surrounding <br/>
it?<br/>
Where does the Chinese connection come from; is this not simply a <br/>
Japanese tsuba?<br/>
Are the ryo-hiotsu later additions?  The rims appear to have been <br/>
inserted later.<br/>
The nakago-hitsu is surprisingly lacking in any signs of wear?<br/>

Well...  I opine this is not Japanese at all and certainly not old.  It is a<br/>
recent copy made in China, as evidenced by the five claws and the style of the<br/>
dragon.  This is NOT IMHO a Japanese work.  Note also the crude asymmetry in<br/>

Also, swords were made for China export by the Ashikaga shoguns during the<br/>
early Muromachi period and presumably they were mounted with Japanese<br/>
fittings. But I would be very, very surprised if a Chinese emperor, or any<br/>
other Chinese for that matter, would order specific fittings made for such<br/>
blades.<br/>

1.	One sword to Chinese emperor (Ming dynasty) in 1401.<br/>
2.	Again, 100 swords among 202 pieces of varieties of swords <br/>

Time and again in China, very fine quality old Japanese swords (for <br/>

How about royal tsuba? <br/>
So far this dragon design tsuba seems to be the first one that <br/>

p.s. This tsuba was not cast. There is no trace of casting work can <br/>

So the question really is which emperor in Chinese history was the <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes, of course Mr Chen Ying-chaw, you are right.  I believe this is known as the<br/>
Kango Trade in the Kamakura period and later.  This was published in English<br/>
about 25 or so years ago in the USA - one of the Tai Kai publications. I had not<br/>
read of the Trade in the early Shinto period/late Ming, but of course this is<br/>
not a well-researched area in the West, nor, I guess, in China either given the<br/>
vicissitudes of the past 110 years.  With this lack of knowledge it isn't<br/>
surprising that no one (?) on this list knows anything about such a tsuba as Mr<br/>
Chen Ying-chaw has drawn our attention to.  So, given this lack of specific<br/>
knowledge about the Japan-China trade in Nihonto I can only go by the tsuba AS A<br/>
TSUBA in the context of my Japanese-centred knowledge.  More and better quality<br/>
images of this very interesting tsuba are warranted given the queries and issues<br/>
raised.<br/>
<br/>
I've looked long and hard at the very interesting image Mr Chen Ying-chaw has<br/>
drawn our attention to, and I note the following:<br/>
<br/>
- the quality of the work is poor.<br/>
- note particularly the asymmetric shape of the nakago ana, as I have mentioned<br/>
- note also the clumsy, unrefined shape of the seppa dai outline<br/>
- note also the nakago ana placement in the seppa dai lacks symmetry.<br/>
- finally, the mimi (rim) varies in width in a manner most uncharacteristic of<br/>
  Japanese tsubako.<br/>
<br/>
Being familiar with the exquisite excellence of Japanese metal work in tsuba and<br/>
fuchigashira, I cannot accept that this tsuba was made under the auspices of the<br/>
Japanese Emperor for the Chinese Emperor.  Let me propose another theory.<br/>
<br/>
Mr Chen Ying-chaw notes:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > 1. Chinese emperor was the only one who is entitled<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>However, in Japan the dragon is a very common theme on all manner of things.<br/>
Granted I have only seen 3 fingered dragons in Japanese art, but the so-called<br/>
Canton tsuba were imported into Japan and I suggest that this tsuba could be of<br/>
Chinese origin intended to be exported to Japan at one time.  Supporting this<br/>
theory is the observation that this tsuba appears to have never been fitted to a<br/>
sword, as indeed a great number of Japanese tsuba were never fitted to swords.<br/>
I cannot recall seeing hitsuana of the specific type shown in the image.<br/>

still have the correspondence in my archive.  There was no conclusive<br/>

I'm sure we would all like to hear more about such finds with pictures and<br/>
scholarly information if they exist.  Indeed, the article on the Kango Trade<br/>
speculated that many of the very best quality Koto were exported to China and<br/>
hoped that some could still be found and restored to the world.<br/>

This exhausts my poor and inadequate opinion, so now I will retire from the<br/>
lists and hope someone can offer a more definitive opinion.  I stand by my<br/>
opinion that this is NOT a Japanese-made item.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1636950438">Hi Barry and Mr. Chen;<br/>
<br/>
Interesting thread.  While there is quite a bit of evidence relating to the trade in weapons in the Muromachi period between Japan and China, the style of the tsuba you have illustrated is not of a style from this period of trade, but from a much later period.  There have been many discussions trying to determine what happened to the thousands of swords exported to China during this period.  Also the popular opinion is that these swords were mounted in koshira, so would have had the required tsuba and other fittings, at least on a portion of the swords exported even if not all.  Seeing as the numbers exported were in the tens of thousands over a long period, it seems reasonable to think there should be a quantity of tsuba remaining from these weapons.<br/>
<br/>
Here is a link to a picture of a tsuba that I think was made for this export market in Japan, and it is in the style and iron of the period used in Japan, it is the second picture from the top.  If you look at the next picture it is of a similar style of tsuba but the iron is different as is the style of construction and it is from a later period of production even though of a similar style, and is about 100 years later in manufacture.  This would cause one to wonder if this trade continued though the years but perhaps in smaller quantities.<br/>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-596314179">In China it would be unthinkable to have tsuba made using dragon as <br/>
insignia. Some might challenge my view by asking, ¡°But I do find <br/>
that dragon designs appear on robes that Chinese emperor used to <br/>
wear.¡± That is quite right. Only that custom as a rule is quite <br/>
exceptional in case of tsuba. We all know that tsuba is intended for <br/>
hand protection. The tsuba will receive heavy chopping force <br/>
initiated by the enemy. In case of dragon tsuba sword, it would mean <br/>
that the emperor was getting hit each time the tsuba received chops <br/>
by the enemy. Damage of any kind on the dragon of this tsuba would <br/>
imply that the emperor¡¯s fate would soon be as damaged as the tsuba.<br/>
There never was rules prohibiting Chinese craftsman to produce tsuba <br/>
with dragon insignia on it. The idea simply would not come up in <br/>
anyone¡¯s mind in China. As a matter of fact I seriously doubt that <br/>
the Japanese sword bearing this dragon tsuba never ever reached <br/>
Chinese Palace. The Chinese Foreign Trade officer would have singled <br/>
it out from the list of Japanese contributions and confiscated the <br/>
sword along with the palms burning dragon tsuba. A sword¡¯s blade <br/>
with dragon designs engraved on it? Yes, it is possible. And I <br/>
myself can show you ancient swords to that effect. Why was it <br/>
possible? Well, blade is something that has power of hitting ones <br/>
enemy. The idea goes harmoniously well with the powerful image of an <br/>
emperor. You just could not put a Chinese emperor on a tsuba in form <br/>
of a dragon in order to expose His powerless position of getting hit <br/>

The issue of whether or not this tsuba being made in Japan really <br/>
rest with the authentication result of the dragon design itself. <br/>
There are differences in terms of detail design between Japan and <br/>
China. May be the Japanese royal artifact specialist would be more <br/>
interested to do the authentication. I strongly believe that, well <br/>
made or not, this tsuba was of Japanese origin. <br/>
I have posted two more photos of the tsuba I am referring to just in <br/>
case anyone of you would like to take a stronger view. (Photos <br/>
placed in folder named SOSIDORE)<br/>
In my previous message I once proclaimed that five claws and only <br/>
five claws can prove that the dragon concerned was exclusively <br/>
crafted for Chinese emperor. It was not true. The more I studied the <br/>
more evidence indicated that four claws or even three claws dragons <br/>
had been found to be owned by Chinese emperors. Sorry for <br/>
misinformation.<br/>

Re: Iron Dragon Tsuba -- Photos in folder entitled SOSIDORE<br/>
<br/>
The captioned tsuba could be an artifact that can best illustrate <br/>
the historical cultural exchange between China and Japan before <br/>
first Sino-Japanese war. <br/>
Japan used to send contribution to Chinese emperors since as long <br/>
ago as 8th century A.D. And swords were among the list of Japanese <br/>
contributions. In return China had Japanese delegate brought home <br/>
much much more than they gave. I did not invent stories like this. <br/>
Chinese history had had ample records about them. I would believe <br/>
that in Tokyo palace vault there are tremendous number of treasury <br/>
that once were gifts from Chinese emperors. They must have been well <br/>
documented. Japanese gives and takes. I wish someday Chinese <br/>
friendship contributions could be made possible for all to see. <br/>
Now, why am I so sure that the captioned tsuba was made in Japan? <br/>
Apart from material, workmanship and style in general, the most <br/>
obvious point in focus is the mustach of the dragon. The dragon on <br/>
this tsuba is thick with mustach. That is what so unique about it. <br/>
Please try to take a strong view on Meiji silver one-yen coin. The <br/>
Japanese dragon design on the said coin is thick with mustach, too. <br/>
There should be no one challenge the authenticity of Japanese dragon <br/>
on Japanese one-yen Meiji silver coin. In case of Chinese dragon, <br/>
the dragons are mustach free since Ming and Ching dynasty. <br/>
Interesting parties will please visit two web pages listed below. <br/>
They are equally authentically emperial style in China. Please note <br/>
the dragons there. No mustach.<br/>

I would like to suggest something here. The implication of my <br/>
finding point out an interesting direction for tsuba collectors to <br/>
pursue. Some tsubas used to bear a mission of introducing things <br/>
Japan to foreign people. Japan was on the rice during Meiji period. <br/>
They were eager to introduce themselves to the world. Next time when <br/>
you are about to make a choice of collection take a strong view and <br/>
think. Is this tsuba specially made with people like me in mind? If <br/>
you do then you hold a mysterious key that could open a cross time <br/>
dialog with the original creator far away and long ago in a country <br/>
call Japan.  <br/>
