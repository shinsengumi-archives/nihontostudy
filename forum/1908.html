<h3>Shodai Hizen Yukihiro wakizashi</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-485778062">Hi all - <br/>
<br/>
A local friend of mine, Dave Ballew, because of health problems, is selling his shodai Yukihiro wakizashi. It is in polish, Tokubetsu Hozon, ubu, shirasaya, nice. Avoiding Ebay, he has asked that I place a link to the some pictures of the sword to our groups. <br/>
<br/>
Here it is: www.nethumidors.com/sword.htm   (If link doesn't work, just type it is.)<br/>
<br/>
I'm very familiar with this sword and agree, it is a nice, exuberant example of Yukihiro's work. Why do I not buy it myself? Hmmm...if you saw my sword debts at the moment, you wouldn't ask that question. It would be nice to keep this excellent sword "in the St. Louis family" but sometimes that's impossible. Please, contact Dave direct. His email and all other pertinent is posted through this link to the photos. If you have any problems with the photos (can't see why, but...), Dave's email is: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:davidballew@...">davidballew@...</a>. Feel safe; Dave's a good guy.<br/>
