Why is that ?  I mean if the soft metal inlays were added in the Edo <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-228259218">All, I picked up some good bargains on the weekend. A full set of  <br/>
Kanzan Token Koza by Sato Kanzan and a full set of Toso Kodogu Koza by <br/>
Wakayama Takeshi. I know that books 5 and 6 of Sato's books are hard to <br/>
get but I have never see the full set of Toso Kodogu Koza listed <br/>
anywhere before, well at least in the last 4 or 5 years. Are they quite <br/>
rare now ?,  I have seen the odd single books around but not the full set.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-945847600">Hi:<br/>
 Perhaps it is only the Japanese mind set, but isn't it analogous to a<br/>
koshirae that fails shinsa because the menuki were replaced, or even the<br/>
hilt rewrapped?  How about a sword that is retempered, or more closely<br/>
that is downgraded because the horimono is atoh-bori? What about a<br/>
Rembrandt that some later artist "improved" by brightening up one of<br/>
those dark backgrounds? Sword polishing is reductive, these other things<br/>
are additive.<br/>

Later inlay is a case by case judgment.  Because the originality of the tsuba is compromised, there will usually be a significant point reduction for later inlay to a good, older iron plate.  If the inlay is extensive it will probably fail.   If it is an attempt to "convert" the tsuba to a different type (even if mumei), or is very crude or done after the Edo period, it will fail.<br/>
<br/>
A hypothetical good Muromachi period Tosho guard with a subtle mon inlaid during the Edo period would probably pass, but with a much lower point level that the unaltered plate would have been awarded.  Also, if there is significant alteration to the piece, the date given will be that of the latest work.<br/>
<br/>
Most of the late gomoku zogan, mukade, etc., will fail for poor quality.  Maybe an exceptional example could pass, but I can't think of any examples.  Does anyone have one of these guards with an origami? <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1602641393">Agreeing with Jim is a standard responsearound here (as it should <br/>
be). I have a tsuba that confirms one of his points exactly- a late <br/>
muromachi/momoyama tosho plate that got dressed up later w/ a gold <br/>
mimi and gold and shakudo mons- it did paper at a previous shinsa <br/>
(72 pts) to "Mid-Edo Shoami".  Had the soft-metal work not been of <br/>
very good quality it certainly would have scored lower and I can <br/>
only guess at what it would have done had the plate been unaltered.<br/>

My friend Ted didn't submit the blade for shinsa. I doubt they could had said much about it because of its condition. Ted headed for the east coast after Chicago (and got stranded with car trouble) and I brought his sword back with me, so I have it here. I'll sit with it for awhile and try to see what you are explaining here, and will pass it on to Ted when he gets home. Interesting to see both blades together. Your sword was more than I expected.

I remember that koshirae of course, it was quite interesting and was well received.  The dates of the period divisions are not exact.  We use this set of terms for the Edo period &#27743;&#25144;&#26178;&#20195;:<br/>
<br/>
 初期 shoki, the first part of the Edo period after Momoyama<br/>
前期 zenki, early Edo<br/>
<br/>
中期 chuki, mid Edo<br/>
<br/>
後期 koki, late Edo<br/>
<br/>
末期 baki, latest Edo, Bakumatsu.<br/>

The start of late Edo would be around the early 1800's.<br/>

  I remember that koshirae of course, it was quite interesting and was well received.  The dates of the period divisions are not exact.  We use this set of terms for the Edo period &#27743;&#25144;&#26178;&#20195;:<br/>
<br/>
  初期 shoki, the first part of the Edo period after Momoyama<br/>
  前期 zenki, early Edo<br/>
<br/>
  中期 chuki, mid Edo<br/>
<br/>
  後期 koki, late Edo<br/>
<br/>
  末期 baki, latest Edo, Bakumatsu.<br/>
<br/>
  The start of late Edo would be around the early 1800's.<br/>

    Hi Jim - <br/>

    Perhaps an obvious answer here, but when a kodogu worksheet states "late Edo," when does this begin, in the eyes of the Chicago team? <br/>

Fields of Musashi/Sekigahara/memento-mori.  Impermanence of course has Buddhist resonance as well.  Fitting out an entire koshirae in that motif is a bit over the top.  I suppose that there is a chance that it was put together for an early Western buyer, but that example didn't strike me as a typical export item.  <br/>
<br/>
I'm speculating, but that koshirae doesn't seem like mainstream merchant or bushi wear.  It may be more of a gangster or gambler item, or something that someone from another class would wear to pretend while out on the town.  Maybe an equivalent of the mid-late 20th C American biker aesthetic as co-opted by upper-middle-class-baby-boomer Harley owners.    <br/>

There are people on this list who have spent a lot more time on late Edo period social history that I have -- any other ideas???<br/>

Kyo kanagu shi is 京 Kyoto 金具 metal fittings 帥 maker.  (Although dictionary definitions of this shi kanji are more like master or commander, I haven't seen it translated that way for this compound term.)  I have seen it used as an attribution on both NTHK and NBTHK origami.  <br/>
<br/>
The meaning sounds rather similar to Kyo Kinko (&#20140;&#37329;&#24037;), or Kyoto metalsmith, but in practice usually designates somewhat lower quality work.  A lot of mumei Edo period kozuka and kogai made in Goto style, but not actually Goto work, will get an attribution to Kyo Kinko.  Something that deviates further from Goto style and is a bit lower quality will be called Kyo Kanagushi.  That's not an exhaustive definition, but I hope it gives you some idea.  <br/>
<br/>
A lot of Edo period kinko material isn't distinctive enough to allow an attribution to an individual or even a group.  For another example, a lot of later, average, unsigned menuki will be attributed to Kyo Kanagushi.  It's not necessarily bad stuff, but there's no way to identify it further.<br/>
<br/>
Your kozuka is probably borderline for passing due to the quality and condition being a bit rough, but if it did, the attribution would likely be Kyo kanagu shi based on what I've observed.<br/>

<br/>
Interesting to read more about these terms. Going back again to the very minute-sized shakudo dragon menuki that received "Kyo-kanagushi" in Chicago. What had me thinking they might be, shall I say...higher quality (?)...was the use of gold utori on the (male's) tail and the wiskers. It surprised me to think they (Kyo-kanagushi/late Edo anybody) did utori work. Utori overlay always makes me think Momoyama. Anything worth expanding on here? Just curious.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1621594028">Uttori is a technique where the metal foil was attached without soldering by crimping/staking/pushing the edges of the gold or silver around the "design" into the base metal.  It was popular in the Muromachi and Momoyama periods and then died out rather abruptly.  The problem with uttori is that once the foil is worn through in a spot there is nothing to stop the edges from being peeled back and the foil pulled away from wear.  <br/>
<br/>
The uttori technique was replaced by various iroe technologies where the metal foils were attached to the base by soldering or other "glue" techniques.  It wears better, but it isn't quite as beautiful as uttori to those of us who like the old stuff.  Most iroe gold isn't as thick as uttori, perhaps because it doesn't have to be so strong to withstand the forming and crimping (and thick is expensive).  Still, some iroe can be rather thick, so the distinction in the technique is in how the foil is attached rather than the thickness.<br/>
<br/>
There is a series to be found in Goto, Waki Goto, Kyo Kinko and Kyo Kanagushi.  Uttori would point toward Ko-Goto (pre Edo Goto).  The quality of the base metal is one key in differentiating the levels -- true black shakudo at one end grading into a brown alloy at the other. The quality of the carving is of course very important as is that of the inlay.  It is all case by case as many people at different levels copied and modified classic Goto motifs.<br/>

Interesting to read more about these terms. Going back again to the very minute-sized shakudo dragon menuki that received "Kyo-kanagushi" in Chicago. What had me thinking they might be, shall I say...higher quality (?)...was the use of gold utori on the (male's) tail and the wiskers. It surprised me to think they (Kyo-kanagushi/late Edo anybody) did utori work. Utori overlay always makes me think Momoyama. Anything worth expanding on here? Just curious.  <br/>

<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I am also looking for Elliot Freeman. The reason I am looking for these<br/>
people is they did not give me their address at the shinsa to send out their<br/>
kantei-sho. Also, some addresses didn't get copied entirely, but I have<br/>
contacted everyone with problems already. Appreciate any help here. As for<br/>
Jerome Newman, he signed G. Jerome Newman, so he might be George Newman.<br/>
