Surprised nobody has not mentioned this new 2-volume publication on Sue-Koto: Japanese Swords of the 15th and 16th Centuries, the latest publication being offered by the JSS/US at a bargain price (thanks to an anonymous financial contributor)...$50 plus shipping. Harry Watson is handling orders <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:afu@...">afu@...</a> for the JSS/US. Double-spiral bound, 5-1/2" x 8-1/2" size. Two fat volumes chuck full of great information, cheap!!! <br/>

<br/>
All, I have started a blog, not so much a forum but more a repository <br/>
for information on tosogu. We have a few contributors but most are busy <br/>
at present and articles a slow coming in, but they will come. I have an <br/>
interesting article on Owari tsuba being translated at the moment, and <br/>
hope to have several stories on Japan after my October trip.<br/>
<br/>
Please have a look if you have time, this is not run as a forum with <br/>
moderators, rules and open discussion, but as a collective wanting to <br/>
place as much information on Tosogu in one spot as possible.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone would like to offer an article, just let me know.<br/>
<br/>
