<h3>New Website for Japanese auctions</h3>
by <i>nichido66</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-999903498">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
Nichido Ltd (Japan) has launched a new Website through which you can<br/>
easily bid on Japanese online auctions and have your goods sent to your<br/>
home.<br/>
<br/>
www.japanauctioncenter.com<br/>
  <<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.japanauctioncenter.com">http://www.japanauctioncenter.com</a>><br/>
The biggest advantage is that the bidding procedure is very simple and<br/>
service fees are low.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-489364623">Hi John, actually, 8% is not bad, I know of dealers and buyers in Japan <br/>
who charge 15% and get good custom. The 1000JY fee is for internal <br/>
shipping with in Japan. The issue is, many sellers in Japan won't ship <br/>
internationally. They don't want the bother, and they don't pack items <br/>
to ship out of the country. The intermediate buyer should handle all <br/>
that very well. Mine does.<br/>

Of course everything is a risk and dropping 10K on a sword in an online <br/>
auction is pretty risky anyway unless you really know what you are <br/>
doing. There's a lot to be said for holding something in the hand.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-689149824">Hi John, I know what you are saying, though it is not much different <br/>
from what Ebay charges for you to sell items at the end of an auction. <br/>
It's the reverse in Japan ( as with most things ), the buyer pays. I <br/>
agree, on high priced items it bites, but on books and lower end items, <br/>
it can be quite reasonable.<br/>

Rich is right. They charge that 15%. The ones that<br/>
charge 10% seem to have higher 'other charges' so it<br/>
feels like I am paying them 13 or 14%. If an item is<br/>
worth less than $300, I almost don't bother bidding on<br/>
it, becuase the fees will eat me up.<br/>
<br/>
That said, I've never tried buying a sword from Japan.<br/>
But occassionally a deal or a rare item can be found,<br/>
even with all the fees. I missed out on a nice papered<br/>
Yagyu tsuba earlier this year. Even with fees, it<br/>
would have been about 65% to 70% of what a dealer<br/>
would charge.<br/>

<h3>Re: New Website for Japanese auctions</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-845283769">There's something interesting to this from a business standpoint.  As <br/>
the buyer you have to deposit upfront the money through Paypal to <br/>
their account which they keep until the auction closes irreguardless <br/>
of whether you are the high bidder or not.  Now think of this in <br/>
terms of if they get to be a big business.  They could have quite a <br/>
large ammount of money on the kite -- making interest in their <br/>
account just like an insurance company does.  And Paypal has a pretty <br/>
good interest percentage. Nice source of revenue!  By the way -- they <br/>
aren't responsible for just about anything so read the fine print <br/>
carefully.<br/>

I have been looking at these for about a year,<br/>
mailorderjapan does have a unique tranlating service. <br/>
I condone none of these.  I had made a suggestion that<br/>
the JSS/US could make a deal with one of these<br/>
services for cheaper rates/caps for the membership.  I<br/>
assume that won't happen though.<br/>
<br/>
Rates are similiar some 10%, 12%, some have<br/>
protection, some only charge 500 yen for shipping (or<br/>
actual cost if higher), each is a little different so<br/>
you have to look at them all and how they operate to<br/>
truly compare.  The 8% seems to be the lowest.<br/>
<br/>
You also have to understand that banks in japan charge<br/>
high fees and don't have free checking like in the US.<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I agree expensive at times, but likely cheaper than<br/>
getting it here in the US and/or no availibility here<br/>
in the US.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-125258228">Well Guys, I do not know how or if this service would be compatible <br/>
with the purchase of swords due to the special hoops one must jump <br/>
through to get exportation papers. In those cases my sellers have <br/>
done all that with no extra charge. Of course they are already <br/>
making a nice profit and why gild a goose. Most sellers seem to bend <br/>
over backwards to accommodate repeat trade. I would approach someone <br/>
I know, if needs be, to send a package, our small community would be <br/>
no loss to these outfits I'm sure with all the stuff else that is <br/>
auctioned. John                                                     -<br/>
