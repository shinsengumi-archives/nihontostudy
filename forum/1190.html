<h3>speaking of publishing...</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1132387948">Hey guys,<br/>
<br/>
In case anybody is interested, there are several companies that will do <br/>
short run books for<br/>
what seem to be pretty reasonable prices - check out this week's <br/>
business week - the three<br/>
listed are snapfish.com, imagestation.com, and MyPublisher.com - they <br/>
talked about using them<br/>
for photos mostly, but I can't see any reason why you couldn't throw <br/>
jpegs with typing in 'em<br/>
as well...<br/>
<br/>
Immortalize your collection now :-)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>There is a reason that text could be a problem.<br/>
<br/>
In general, you're looking at 180 dpi for the recommended resolution of<br/>
photographs and pictures. You could go as low as 150dpi in some cases,<br/>
but everything over 180dpi is overkill.<br/>
<br/>
For text, the line is drawn around 400dpi.<br/>
<br/>
If these guys are stuck on photos, you may have a 180dpi resolution<br/>
hardcoded everywhere... which means your text will look bad. <br/>
<br/>
Still worthwhile to look into, but this should be kept in mind.<br/>
