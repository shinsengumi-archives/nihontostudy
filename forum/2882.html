<h3>A shakudo, sukashi tsuba ...</h3>
by <i>drjohnplissenden</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1780266390">Dear colleagues<br/>
<br/>
I should be grateful for any pointers that you can offer me <br/>
regarding an attribution for the tsuba illustrated in my photo album <br/>
JPL.  It is of a violet/black shakudo, and was purchased by its <br/>
previous owner in 1938.  It depicts, in a delicate openwork, a bell <br/>
cricket amidst suzuki grasses.  The grass is decorated with gold <br/>
taka-zogan dewdrops.<br/>
<br/>
I have always thought, by reason of the 'brightness' of its <br/>
execution, the lack of any evidence of it ever having been mounted, <br/>
and sekigane in the nakago-hitsu that appear more decorative than <br/>
functional, that it was Edo work.<br/>
<br/>
During a recent visit to the Bing exhibition, at the Van Gough <br/>
Museum in Amsterdam, I saw a very similar guard on loan from the <br/>
Museum fur Kunst et Kewerbe in Hamburg - stupidly I omitted to <br/>
record its accession number.  This was attributed to Nakai Zensuke <br/>
Tomotsune I (1669 -1730.  Can I be so wrong in the dating of my own <br/>
tsuba?<br/>
<br/>
With my thanks in advance for any suggestions<br/>
John L.</div>

You are quite correct, of course.  I realised, as soon as I had <br/>
posted my e-mail, that I should have said 'late Edo' - my apologies<br/>

I don't think that this tsuba could be as early as Nakai Tomotsune.  I don't have an attribution for it, but I agree with your late Edo period date.  The combination of the naturalistic rendering of the grass and the schematic style of the cricket is interesting.  The carving of the grass resembles Choshu/Bushu style, although of course many others did the same, and the style of the cricket is a lot like the sukashi "drawing" style in Akasaka work.<br/>
